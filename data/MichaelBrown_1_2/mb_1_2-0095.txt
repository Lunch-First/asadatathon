 Common Dreams has issued the following news release:
In the wake of Michael Brown's shooting death at the hands of a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri last weekend, a new movement on Twitter is criticizing media portrayals of young black Americans as thuggish and violent with the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown. 
Started by Twitter user @CJ_Musick_Lawya, #IfTheyGunnedMeDown is populated by users posting two pictures of themselves, side by side, showing them in contrasting images -- one clean-cut and accomplished, the other appearing stereotypically "thuggish." The hashtag accompanying the photos questions which image the media would use, out of context, in the case of their death.
