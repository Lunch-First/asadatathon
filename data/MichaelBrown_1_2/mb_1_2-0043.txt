ST LOUIS: Violence again erupted in St Louis, Missouri, near the site of the police shooting death of an unarmed black teenager, according to local police, despite calls by President Barack Obama and activists for a measured response. 
Early yesterday a police officer shot and critically wounded a man who drew a gun near the site of protests over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, a St Louis County Police Department officer said.
Police responded about an hour after midnight to reports of four or five men with shotguns and wearing ski masks. They encountered a number of people running, one of whom pulled a gun on an officer, who fired at him. The man was taken to a hospital.
Soon after midnight the police fired tear gas into protesters who had confronted a line of officers after a far larger crowd dispersed, St Louis County Police Department spokesman Brian Schellman said.
The incidents followed two nights of violent protests, looting and arrests in Ferguson, the largely black St Louis suburb. Obama promised a full investigation into the teenager's death.
"I urge everyone in Ferguson, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding," Obama said.
Friends and family of Brown held a peaceful church vigil on Tuesday night, after his father pleaded for an end to the violence. "I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way," said, Michael Brown sr.
The Reverend Al Sharpton, a New York-based civil rights leader, called for peaceful protests in the wake of looting and more than 50 arrests since the shooting. Activists were demanding that authorities make public the name of the officer involved. The police said they would do so on Tuesday, but changed the plan.
Police said Brown was shot in a struggle over a gun in a police car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle. A witness has said that Brown was putting his hands up to surrender when he was killed. - Reuters
