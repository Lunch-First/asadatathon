<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON o Law enforcement officials on Wednesday asked for patience to allow the investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown to take its course as tension over the teenager's death continued for a fifth straight day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said his office will take as much time as necessary to review circumstances that led a Ferguson police officer to fatally shoot the 18-year-old Brown on a street Saturday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The timeline on this is there is no timeline,&quot; McCulloch told an afternoon news conference. &quot;We will do this as expeditiously as possible. But we won't rush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resisting pressure from street demonstrators and public officials for answers that show why the unnamed officer confronted Brown and a companion shortly after noon on Saturday, McCulloch said the details may not emerge until the process of collecting evidence and presenting it to the grand jury is complete. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that's not the answer anybody wants to hear at this point,&quot; he said. &quot;Everybody wants to know what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCulloch called the problem twofold. First, he said, ethical rules prevent prosecutors from disseminating the physical evidence. He also said he won't do anything to corrupt the integrity of the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to a reporter's question, McCulloch said it will certainly take more than two weeks to complete the investigation. He offered no specific estimate of the timetable. He cited a heavy volume of information that is being gathered in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to test the veracity and accuracy of anybody who comes to us,&quot; McCulloch said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCulloch said a lot of information has come forward through social media, &quot;some of it good, some of it bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed that the medical examiner's report, 911 tapes and other investigative material will be withheld at this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One new detail of Saturday's shooting did emerge Wednesday when Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson in another news conference said the officer who shot Brown suffered facial injuries and was taken to a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson also acknowledged that mending the strained relationship between his department and the African-American community is imperative for the city and region to move ahead following nearly a week of outrage, violence and looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have always had real good relations with all of the neighborhood associations,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;Apparently, there's been this undertow that now has bubbled to the surface, and it's our first priority to address it, to fix what's wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step, he added, is working with the community relations office on race relations that the U.S. Justice Department has dispatched to Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief defended the racial makeup of the Ferguson department. Three of the agency's 53 officers are African-American in a community where two-thirds of the population is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said he has worked to improve the diversity of the police department, adding it is a &quot;constant struggle to hire and retain personnel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past few years, Jackson said, he has tried not only to recruit but improve quality of life in the department, including pay levels, to retain officers longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments from law enforcement in a week that has seen forums, prayer vigils and a clergy-led parade Wednesday that passed many of the looted West Florissant Avenue businesses did little to quell the outrage spawned by Brown's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As has been the case since Monday, the parking lot of a QuikTrip looted and burned Sunday evening has been the epicenter of hostility between protesters and police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The animosity for the most part was verbal Wednesday until a thrown bottle prompted police to fire smoke bombs at the crowd shortly before 9 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police then ordered demonstrators to evacuate the area or face arrest the protesters responded that &quot;we are not going anywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police a short time later chased protesters into nearby neighborhoods after dispersing the crowd for the third straight night with tear gas grenades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, police also used piercing-sound sonic cannons to scatter the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they have since Saturday, demonstrators throughout the evening taunted and threatened police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I'm going to go, I'm taking one of you with me,&quot; warned one demonstrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another shouted, &quot;We're not dogs, so what the hell you've got those whipping sticks for? Because you want to whip us like dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A county police tactical operations armored vehicle was deployed at the demonstration site for most of the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protected by body armor, police sat atop the vehicle methodically fitting high-caliber automatic weapons into tripods which were then trained on the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are being ordered to leave now!&quot; police announced frequently through a public address system. &quot;If you don't leave peacefully there will be arrests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd ignored the demand until the tear gas was fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of midnight there were reports of sporadic gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHOOTING CHARGES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors filed felony charges Wednesday against a man shot by police in a confrontation earlier in the day near the scene of the protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esrail Britton, 19, was charged with second-degree assault on a law enforcement officer and armed criminal action. He remained hospitalized, and earlier in the day was reported to be in critical condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said they have two addresses for Britton, both of them vacant dwellings in the St. Louis area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting occurred about 1 a.m. at West Florissant Avenue and Chambers Road, in an unincorporated area of St. Louis County, as county police responded to a report of four of five men with masks and shotguns in an area where shots were heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALDERMAN FRENCH, JOURNALISTS ARRESTED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis Alderman Antonio French was among about 10 people arrested Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French was being held at the Ferguson Police Department but no details of his arrest were being released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wesley Lowery, a reporter with the Washington Post, was arrested Wednesday evening along with Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post, according to a Twitter post by Lowery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wrote that police came into the McDonald's on West Florissant where the two were working, and tried &quot;to kick everyone out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officers decided we weren't leaving McDonald's quickly enough, shouldn't have been taping them,&quot; he tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officers slammed me into a fountain soda machine because I was confused about which door they were asking me to walk out of,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that he was detained, booked, &quot;given answers to no questions. Then just let out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reilly tweeted that a SWAT team invaded the McDonald's where he was working and recharging his phone, and asked for identification when he took a photo. They tried to kick everyone out, he wrote. He wrote that he was &quot;assaulted&quot; by an officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCHOOL START DELAYED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continuing unrest forced the Ferguson-Florissant school district to postpone the start of school from today to Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In order to allow additional time for the situation to stabilize and for all of our students and their families to resume normal routines, we will reschedule the first day of school,&quot; district officials said in a statement. &quot;We believe that this change will help ensure a strong start to the new school year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
