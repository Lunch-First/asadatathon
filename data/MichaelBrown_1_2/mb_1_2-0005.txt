Police in Ferguson, in the US state of Missouri, firing tear gas, stun grenades and smoke bombs to disperse some 350 protesters late on Wednesday, the fifth night of racially charged demonstrations after police shot to death an unarmed black teen. Some demonstrators hurled rocks and smoke bombs at police officers while others scattered down side streets and scrambled into cars.
 Protesters have been gathering every night since last Saturday, when 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead in the mostly black suburb of St Louis during what the authorities said was a struggle over a gun in a police car. About 40 protesters have been arrested so far.
