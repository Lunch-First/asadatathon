<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Missouri: Violence again erupted in the St Louis area near the site of the police shooting death of an unarmed black teenager, according to local police, despite calls by US President Barack Obama and activists for a measured response. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early yesterday, a police officer shot and critically wounded a man who drew a handgun near the site of protests over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, a St Louis County Police Department officer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police responded about an hour after midnight to reports of four or five men with shotguns and wearing ski masks. They encountered a number of suspects running, one of whom pulled a gun on an officer, who fired at him, the county officer said. The man was taken to an area hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after midnight, police fired tear gas into protesters who had confronted a line of officers after a far larger crowd dispersed, St Louis County Police Department spokesman Brian Schellman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A photograph in the St Louis Post-Dispatch showed a protester wearing a shirt with an American flag printed on it throwing a tear gas container back at the police. There were other media reports of bottles thrown at police. The incidents followed two nights of violent protests, looting and arrests in Ferguson, the largely black St Louis suburb where the shooting of Brown took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama promised a full investigation by the US Department of Justice into the teenager's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but... I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and family of Brown held a church vigil on Tuesday night, after his father urged an end to the violence. Standing with supporters, including the Reverend Al Sharpton, Michael Brown sr said he wanted justice for his son but wanted it &quot;the right way&quot;. - Reuters</SPAN></P>
