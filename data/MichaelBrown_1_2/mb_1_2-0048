<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- About 500 people gathered Thursday afternoon in downtown Oakland for a moment of silence for victims of police brutality and to remember Michael Brown, the teen whose fatal shooting by police has rocked a suburb of St. Louis, Mo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group gathered in Oakland fell silent at 4:20 p.m. for about 10 minutes. The quiet was broken as dozens of people began raising their hands and chanting &quot;Hands up, don't shoot,&quot; a refrain used by protestors in Ferguson, Mo,, as they stood before police dressed in riot gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signs at the rally called for justice for Michael Brown and for Oscar Grant, who was shot and killed by a BART police officer in 2011, and Alan Blueford, shot and killed by an Oakland police officer in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blueford's mother, Jeralynn, told the crowd that Brown's killing had reopened emotional wounds she suffered when her son was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not 'Protect and serve,' this is 'Shoot to kill,' and I can't get my Alan back,&quot; Blueford said. &quot;But I can stand up and say, 'I'm not taking anymore.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(Michael Brown's) life mattered. I'm Mike Brown. I am Alan Blueford. You can't shoot these kids down with their hands up. ... None of these people deserved that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Moment of Silence for Victims of Police Brutality, organized online, listed 90 vigils across the country that would participate with a moment of silence and solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event at Oakland's Frank Ogawa Plaza was mirrored across the bay at San Francisco Civic Center and in cities across the country, including Chicago, Philadelphia and New York.</SPAN></P>
