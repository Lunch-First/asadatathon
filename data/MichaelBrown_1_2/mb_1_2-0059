<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT Barack Obama has called the police shooting death of an unarmed black teenager a tragedy and urged a thoughtful response after two nights of violent protests, looting and arrests in a St Louis suburb. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But early yesterday, a police officer shot and critically wounded a man who drew a handgun near the site of the protests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St Louis County Police Department officers responded to reports of four or five men with shotguns and wearing ski masks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of them pulled a gun on an officer, who fired at him, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, police had again fired tear gas into protesters who had confronted a line of officers after a far larger crowd dispersed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama promised a full investigation by the US Department of Justice into the teenager's death, which has provoked outrage in the largely African-American town of Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and family of 18-year-old Michael Brown held a peaceful church vigil on Tuesday night after his father pleaded for an end to the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing with supporters, including the Reverend Al Sharpton, Michael Brown Sr. said he wanted justice but wanted it &quot;the right way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred protesters appeared to heed the calls for non-violence, chanting &quot;hands up, don't shoot&quot; and &quot;no justice, no peace&quot; during a tense but ultimately peaceful stand-off with police clad in riot gear and flanked by armored vehicles near the site of Mr Brown's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Governor Jay Nixon told a packed church the community was &quot;reeling from what feels like an old wound that has been torn open afresh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate incident simmering in California, a vigil was also planned following Monday's shooting death of an unarmed 24-year-old black man in Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
