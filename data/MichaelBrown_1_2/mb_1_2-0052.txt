The police chief in a Missouri town where a police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager said yesterday he would not publicly identify the officer because of death threats. Civil rights leader Al Sharpton, standing with the parents of 18-year-old Michael Brown, said the secrecy was fuelling mistrust of the police in Ferguson, a predominantly black town of about 21,000 residents where violent protests followed the shooting. Police have released few details, saying only that a scuffle developed and at some point, the officer's gun was fired inside a patrol car. Witnesses have said Brown had his hands raised when the officer approached and fired repeatedly.
