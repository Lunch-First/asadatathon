<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Common Dreams has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Ferguson, Missouri on Wednesday arrested reporters and activists, launched tear gas at protesters, and used armored tanks and helicopters to force media out as residents continued to demand answers about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot to death by an officer last weekend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis alderman Antonio French, who had helped organize demonstrations and provide live updates on Twitter, was arrested for &quot;unlawful assembly&quot; after police forced him out of his car and told him he &quot;didn't listen,&quot; according to French's wife, Jasenka Benac French.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two reporters, Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of Huffington Post, were also taken into custody in a foreboding encounter recorded on Lowery's cell phone. An officer can be seen demanding that Lowery stop filming and refusing to answer questions. In a blog post about his experience, Lowery writes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Multiple officers grabbed me. I tried to turn my back to them to assist them in arresting me. I dropped the things from my hands. &quot;My hands are behind my back,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm not resisting. I'm not resisting.&quot; At which point one officer said: &quot;You're resisting. Stop resisting.&quot; That was when I was most afraid -- more afraid than of the tear gas and rubber bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photos and videos from Wednesday night show chaotic scenes as protesters run from police firing rubber bullets through thick clouds of smoke from tear gas canisters. Police also fired tear gas directly at an Al Jazeera camera crew, who had set up equipment to film the protests; after they ran to escape the fumes, officers broke down their cameras.</SPAN></P>
