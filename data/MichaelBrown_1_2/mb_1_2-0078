<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- Demonstrations over the fatal shooting of an unarmed African-American teenager in a St. Louis suburb are slated to spread to Oakland on Friday, putting police and downtown business owners on high alert. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a show of camaraderie with those taking to the streets to protest the recent killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Mo. police officer, anti-police activists in Oakland have called for a march through downtown Oakland Friday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call to action, posted on the Occupy Oakland website, asks supporters to &quot;wear all black&quot; to the protest that is scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. outside City Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The time has come to draw a line in the sand and say 'no more dead kids,' no more police killings and beatings,&quot; the announcement read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday night anti-police marches were a regular occurrence in downtown Oakland two years ago following the eviction of the Occupy Oakland encampments and subsequent battles between police and agitators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the marches were uneventful, but vandals struck again last July following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Florida teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agitators smashed windows of downtown businesses for three consecutive nights following the verdict. One vandal bashed a waiter in the head with a hammer outside a trendy restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police, who were criticized for not being ready to deal with last year's protests, released a statement Thursday that they have increased staffing Friday evening. &quot;The department is prepared to respond in the event that demonstrations and protests become unlawful, threaten public safety, or incite vandalism or property damage,&quot; Officer Johnna Watson wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bar Dogwood, which had its windows smashed last year during the Trayvon Martin protests, will remain open Friday, according to an employee who declined to give his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have any plans to hunker down and fortify,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown, a recent high school graduate, was shot multiple times by a Ferguson police officer Saturday afternoon. Authorities have refused to identify the police officer, and police and witness accounts differ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing has set off several days of protests that grew more violent on Wednesday as several demonstrators tossed Molotov cocktails and other objects at riot police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilwoman Lynette Gibson McElhaney said any vandalism or violence stemming from the Oakland protest would take attention away from the serious issue surrounding fatal police shootings of young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope people in Oakland get that and that we don't become the story by destroying property and endangering lives,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
