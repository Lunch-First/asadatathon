<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrests were 'assault on press freedom' - Washington Post editor <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists across the United States are up in arms about the arrest of two reporters who were covering a demonstration in Ferguson, Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it appears that their release followed a call from a concerned Los Angeles Times journalist, Matt Pearce, to Ferguson's police chief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pearce said on Twitter that when he informed the chief, Thomas Jackson, about the arrests of the Washington Post's Wesley Lowery and Huffington Post's Ryan Reilly, he replied: &quot;Oh god.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reporters were in the city to report on protests that have followed the shooting dead of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, by a police officer on Sunday (10 August).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were writing their copy in a local branch of McDonald's when police in riot gear arrived. The journalists, who were ordered to leave, began to video and take pictures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers demanded that they stop and at one point, as Lowery later tweeted, some &quot;officers slammed me into a fountain soda machine because I was confused about which door they were asking me to walk out of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, asked on Twitter who he feared more, the protesters or the police, Lowery replied: &quot;Easy answer. I'm a black man - the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of the journalists' arrests spread quickly, prompting Pearce to contact Ferguson's police chief. Their release followed soon after, without charges or explanation. They were denied information about the names and badge numbers of the arresting officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Baron, the Washington Post's executive editor, told Poynter in a statement that Lowery &quot;was illegally instructed to stop taking video of officers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described the fact that Lowery was &quot;slammed against a soda machine and then handcuffed&quot; as &quot;wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Huffington Post's Washington bureau chief, Ryan Grim, told Poynter he was &quot;disturbed&quot; by the arrests.</SPAN></P>
