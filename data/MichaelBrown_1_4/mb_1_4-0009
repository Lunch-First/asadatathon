<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal shooting of a black teenager sent hundreds of angry residents out of their apartments in a predominantly black Missouri city in a confrontation with police that lasted several hours. They shouted obscenities and some threats, such as &quot;kill the police&quot;, but there were no reports of additional injuries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black teen was identified as Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager's grandmother, Desiree Harris, saw the 18-year-old recent high school graduate running near her home on Tuesday afternoon when she passed him in her car. Minutes later, she found his body on the street - fatally shot by a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris said she was expecting her grandson to visit her that afternoon but discovered him dead after she heard the commotion outside the apartment complex in Ferguson, a northern suburb of St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was running this way,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My grandson never even got into a fight,&quot; she said. &quot;He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told an acquaintance the shooting was &quot;wrong and it was coldhearted&quot;, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. According to the newspaper, Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, held a sign that read: &quot;Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman with the St. Louis County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting at the request of the local department, confirmed that a Ferguson police officer shot the man. The spokesman didn't give the reason for the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP, the local chapter of the civil rights group, said the FBI should get involved &quot;to protect the integrity of the investigation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He alluded to the 2012 racially charged shooting of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old high school student, by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was subsequently acquitted of murder charges, and to the death of a New York man from a police chokehold after he was confronted for selling individual cigarettes on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaskin said officials in the organization spoke with St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, who told them the teenager had been shot twice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the height of the post-shooting tensions, police at the scene called for about 60 other police units to respond to the area in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 residents, about two-thirds of whom are black.</SPAN></P>
