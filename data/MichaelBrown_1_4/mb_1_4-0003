<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">What happened in Missouri?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basics: An unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown was fatally shot Saturday by a police officer in suburban St. Louis. People protested Saturday, Sunday and Monday, with large crowds of protesters and police facing off multiple times. Some rioting and looting also broke out late Sunday night. The FBI has launched an investigation, but federal authorities will also monitor a separate investigation being carried out by local police.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Why and how was Michael Brown shot?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances surrounding the shooting are unclear. Police said Saturday that the shooting followed an encounter Saturday afternoon involving a police officer, Brown and another person, but additional confirmed details are scarce. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County police, said the episode began with &quot;a physical confrontation.&quot; Belmar did not explain what prompted the confrontation, but he said the officer was pushed back into his squad car during the episode and one shot was fired from the officer's weapon inside the car. Brown was shot multiple times, Belmar said, and all shell casings matched the officer's gun. It's not known yet why the officer shot him or why lethal force was used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, an attorney hired by Brown's family, said Monday evening that witnesses disputed the police account, but he did not elaborate on what those witnesses said occurred. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">What do we know about Michael Brown?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was an 18-year-old who recently graduated from high school and had been set to start studies at Vatterott College, a trade school, on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a good boy,&quot; his father, Michael Brown Sr., said Monday. He described his son as fun, silly and always ready to make people laugh.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">What do we know about the person who shot him?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities have said the shooter was an officer with the Ferguson Police Department. The officer, who has not been identified, has been placed on paid administrative leave.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Who is investigating the shooting?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI is conducting a civil rights investigation, and St. Louis County police are investigating the shooting at the request of the Ferguson Police Department. (Ferguson is part of St. Louis County.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police willsend the results of the investigation to the St. Louis County Attorney's Office for a decision regarding any criminal charges.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Can you tell me anything about Ferguson? </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson is a small, predominantly African American city just outside St. Louis. It has about 21,000 residents, and a little more than two-thirds of them are black, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">What has the response been from people in Ferguson?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vigils and protests followed Brown's death. There was an immediate outcry from the community on Saturday after Brown was killed. Some people chanted, &quot;Kill the police,&quot; according to witnesses. There were reports of additional shots being fired as dozens of police officers arrived at the scene, but no other injuries were reported. There were additional protests Sunday and Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, many people used the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown to show how people in communities far from Ferguson were reacting to the shooting.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Has there been any violence in the wake of Brown's death?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday night, following a candlelight vigil for Brown, some people took to Ferguson's streets, smashing windows and looting stores. A convenience store was set on fire, and a group of men reportedly tried to load an ATM onto a truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 300 officers responded, and 32 people were arrested.Two officers sustained minor injuries.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">How have elected officials in the area responded? </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D), Sens. Claire McCaskill (D) and Roy Blunt (R), St. Louis Mayor Francis G. Slay and County Executive Charlie A. Dooley have all called for a full investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said the local authorities should &quot;complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right&quot; even as the FBI carries out an investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamilah Nasheed, a Missouri state senator, called for the officer who killed Brown to be fired and indicted.</SPAN></P>
