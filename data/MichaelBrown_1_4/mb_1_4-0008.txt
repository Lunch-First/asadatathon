Thousands gather in restive vigil
FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) - A few thousand people have crammed the street where a black man was shot multiple times by a suburban St. Louis police officer. 
The candlelight vigil Sunday night was for 18-year-old Michael Brown, who died a day earlier. Police say he was unarmed.
One group of young men broke off to spray paint "R.I.P. Michael" on the street, and others placed candles, flowers and a teddy bear at the exact location where Brown was killed.
Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., said he appreciated the outpouring of support.
Police say the younger Brown was shot multiple times after a scuffle involving the officer and two people. The officer has been put on leave.
Hundreds of local residents protested earlier, and a civil rights leader expressed outrage at the killing.
