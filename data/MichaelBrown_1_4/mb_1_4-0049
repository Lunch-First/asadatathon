<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds of protesters broke windows of cars and stores after a day of demonstrations over the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black teenager who was shot dead on Saturday by a police officer in the predominantly black neighbourhood of Ferguson, located a few miles north of downtown St Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time he was shot, Brown was unarmed and allegedly surrendering with his hands in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police officer shot him several times, killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the St Louis County Police Department's chief, who is handling the investigation, says Brown assaulted the officer and struggled over the policeman's weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer who shot Brown is on paid leave while the shooting is investigated. On Sunday evening, 30 minutes before a vigil was to be held for Brown, protesters became &quot;aggressive&quot;, according to a news report. A riot then broke out, sending locals inside and running for cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are currently experiencing a riot,&quot; a Ferguson police dispatcher said. St Louis County Police called for more assistance from all surrounding municipalities including St Louis City and the Missouri Highway Patrol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to local reports, several businesses were looted, demonstrators blocked traffic and a civilian was severely beaten. Police in riot gear and the State Trooper SWAT Unit were called out after looters targeted a petrol station and other nearby stores, including a Walmart.Hours after the riots started, police managed to arrest some of the looters who started the violence.</SPAN></P>
