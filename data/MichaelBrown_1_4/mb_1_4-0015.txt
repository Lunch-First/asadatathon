The shooting of black teenager Michael Brown sent hundreds of angry residents out of their apartments in a predominantly black Missouri city in a confrontation with police that lasted hours. They shouted threats, such as "kill the police," but there were no injuries. 
The teenager's grandmother, Desiree Harris, saw the 18-year-old recent high school graduate running near her home in a suburb of St. Louis on Tuesday afternoon when she passed him in her car. Minutes later, she found his body on the street - fatally shot by a police officer.
Harris said she was expecting her grandson, to visit her that afternoon "He was running this way," she said. "When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing."
The shooting was sparked by a fight between the victim and an officer in a squad car that quickly escalated, police said. The officer has been put on administrative leave. AP
