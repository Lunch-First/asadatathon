<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri state police will take charge of security in the town of Ferguson, the state governor said Thursday, after local officers shot dead an unarmed teenager, triggering four days of violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lately it looks like a war zone and that is not acceptable,&quot; Governor Jay Nixon said of -Ferguson, outside St Louis, where county police have been criticised for their military-style crackdown on protests in which another teen was left critically injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will all need to join hands to rebuild the trust that's been lost and help this community regain its stability,&quot; Nixon said, appointing a local African-American officer, Captain Ron Johnson, to take charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, an 18-year-old African-American who was due to start college two days -later, was shot dead by county police on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses and police have given conflicting versions of how the fatal shot was fired, and -anger over the killing triggered angry protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local officers responded by donning military-style combat uniforms, arming themselves with assault rifles, tear gas and rubber bullets, and sending armoured vehicles to crush dissent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reaction was criticised as heavy-handed and over-militarised by critics from across the political spectrum - from civil rights leaders to Republican -Senator Rand Paul to President Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon reacted today by standing down the St Louis County police who had led the crackdown, and drafting in the Missouri Highway Patrol, which answers to the state government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said police would show respect to the citizens as they try to restore calm and &quot;break this cycle of violence&quot;.Despite pleas from protesters, control of the investigation into the police shooting of Brown will remain in the hands of the St Louis County force.</SPAN></P>
