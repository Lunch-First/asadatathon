<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting of black teenager Michael Brown sent hundreds of angry residents out of their apartments in a predominantly black Missouri city in a confrontation with police that lasted hours. They shouted threats, such as &quot;kill the police,&quot; but there were no injuries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager's grandmother, Desiree Harris, saw the 18-year-old recent high school graduate running near her home in a suburb of St. Louis on Tuesday afternoon when she passed him in her car. Minutes later, she found his body on the street - fatally shot by a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris said she was expecting her grandson, to visit her that afternoon &quot;He was running this way,&quot; she said. &quot;When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting was sparked by a fight between the victim and an officer in a squad car that quickly escalated, police said. The officer has been put on administrative leave. AP</SPAN></P>
