ST LOUIS: A violent riot and looting has erupted in Missouri, after a protest over the killing of an unarmed black teen descended into chaos. 
Crowds of protesters broke windows of cars and stores after a day of demonstrations over the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black teenager who was shot dead on Saturday by a police officer in the predominantly black neighbourhood of Ferguson, located a few miles north of downtown St Louis.
At the time he was shot, Brown was unarmed and allegedly surrendering with his hands in the air.
A police officer shot him several times, killing him.
But the St Louis County Police Department's chief, who is handling the investigation, says Brown assaulted the officer and struggled over the policeman's weapon.
The officer who shot Brown is on paid leave while the shooting is investigated. On Sunday evening, 30 minutes before a vigil was to be held for Brown, protesters became "aggressive", according to a news report. A riot then broke out, sending locals inside and running for cover.
"We are currently experiencing a riot," a Ferguson police dispatcher said. St Louis County Police called for more assistance from all surrounding municipalities including St Louis City and the Missouri Highway Patrol.
According to local reports, several businesses were looted, demonstrators blocked traffic and a civilian was severely beaten. Police in riot gear and the State Trooper SWAT Unit were called out after looters targeted a petrol station and other nearby stores, including a Walmart.Hours after the riots started, police managed to arrest some of the looters who started the violence.
