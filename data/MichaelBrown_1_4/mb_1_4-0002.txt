 Council on American-Islamic Relations has issued the following press release:
The St. Louis chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-St. Louis) today joined calls by other civil rights organizations and leaders for a federal investigation into the fatal police shooting on Saturday of 18-year-old Michael Brown.
St. Louis County police said the unarmed Brown had struggled for an officer's gun in a patrol car before he was killed. Witnesses said Brown, who is African-American, had his hands up when he was shot. Brown's death triggered angry demonstrations, as well as vandalism and looting.

"The conflicting accounts of this incident point to the urgent need for a federal investigation to independently determine the facts and to take appropriate action based on that investigation," said CAIR-St. Louis Executive Director Faizan Syed.
Syed also offered CAIR's condolences to Brown's family and loved ones.
CAIR is America's largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization. Its mission is to enhance the understanding of Islam, encourage dialogue, protect civil liberties, empower American Muslims, and build coalitions that promote justice and mutual understanding.
