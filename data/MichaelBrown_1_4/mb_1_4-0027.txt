 Department of Commonwealth, The State of Kentucky has issued the following news release:
Attorney General Jack Conway, Gov. Steve Beshear, First Lady Jane Beshear and members of the Substance Abuse Treatment Advisory Committee today announced that 19 substance abuse treatment grant proposals from across the Commonwealth have been selected for funding through the KY Kids Recovery program.  The grants will fund comprehensive adolescent substance abuse treatment programs, both expanding treatment beds at existing facilities and creating new adolescent treatment programs with the full continuum of care, including intensive outpatient and follow-up care centers. 
"These grants will fund public-private partnerships that will result in expanded treatment for teens in every region of Kentucky," said Attorney General Conway, who chairs the Substance Abuse Treatment Advisory Committee.  "The KY Kids Recovery program is a critical investment in our ongoing effort to stop the cycle of addiction in our Commonwealth.  The recipients of these grants will utilize evidence-based substance abuse treatment services to help families riddled with addiction and save lives in Kentucky." 
Kentucky only has about one-tenth of the treatment beds it needs, and according to the most recent report from the Substance Abuse Health and Mental Services Administration, one in eight Kentucky high school students meet the criteria for a substance abuse disorder. 
"Substance abuse among young people is devastating not only to the individual afflicted by the disease, but to their families, schools and communities," Mrs. Beshear said. "These statewide KY Kids Recovery investments will help break young Kentuckians' cycle of substance abuse through comprehensive treatment and follow-up care, setting them on the right path toward living addiction-free."
Gov. Beshear created the Substance Abuse Treatment Advisory Committee by executive order to oversee the KY Kids Recovery grant program and distribution of the settlement funds.  Existing providers, new providers, community partnerships and nonprofits were eligible to apply for the KY Kids Recovery grants. 
The Substance Abuse Treatment Advisory Committee submitted the 19 recommended proposals to Gov. Beshear, who approved the funding for the recipients.  The programs recommended for funding are located in every region of the state and encompass all aspects of evidence-based, substance abuse services for adolescents, including prevention, outpatient counseling, intensive outpatient and residential services. 
"Kentucky has been woefully lacking in comprehensive, statewide treatment options for youth who suffer from addiction and substance abuse disorders," Gov. Beshear said.  "With these grants, families will now have places to turn to for help.  Early detection and intervention are the keys to solving the larger problem of substance use and abuse across Kentucky."
$17,976,992 has been recommended in funding from an available total of $19,200,000.  The remaining balance will be reserved for future statewide projects and administrative oversight of recipients' expenditures.  Awards will be paid through Kentucky Housing Corporation, in compliance with state accounting procedures.

History of KY Kids Recovery Grants
The KY Kids Recovery grants were created after Attorney General Conway settled cases against two pharmaceutical companies for $32 million.  The court orders filed in both settlements require that the funds be spent on drug treatment programs. 
In addition to the $19 million in KY Kids Recovery grants, the settlement is providing $500,000 to complete construction of a Recovery Kentucky center in Carter County, $2.5 million for almost 900 scholarships over two years to Recovery Kentucky centers, and $560,000 to create 14 drug-free homes for people completing and transitioning out of residential substance abuse treatment programs.
The following entities are also receiving funds over the next two years from the settlement:
         $6 million to administer and upgrade KASPER, Kentucky's electronic prescription drug monitoring program.
         $1 million to support substance abuse treatment for pregnant women by Chrysalis House in Lexington and Independence House in Corbin. 
         $1.5 million to the University of Kentucky to develop best practices for adolescent substance abuse treatment providers.
         $1 million to develop a school-based substance abuse screening tool with the Kentucky Department of Education to intervene with at-risk children before they enter judicial or social services systems.
         $250,000 to create a database to evaluate outcomes of adolescent treatment.
