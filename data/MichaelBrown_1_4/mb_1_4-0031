<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheftic fired a bogey-free 4-under-par 66 to tie for the top spot with Haverford's Nelson Hargrove. Sheftic's score included a 3-under-par 32 on the back nine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hawley's John Pillar Sr. and Pittsburgh's Kevin Shields tied for third at 67, while Moon Township's Roy Vucinich was alone in fifth at 68. The only other players who managed to break 70 on the Donald Ross-designed course were Butler's Robert McClellan, Cheltenham's Michael Brown and Waynesburg's Robert Rohanna, who each shot 69s to tie for sixth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheftic, the son of well-known area teaching pro Ted Sheftic, won the York County Amateur in 1993. Since then he's gone on to become a well-regarded teaching pro in his own right. He currently works at the prestigious Merion Golf Club in eastern Pennsylvania, which was the site of the 2013 U.S. Open. He has also participated in several PGA Championships and was the Pennsylvania Open champion in 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the men chasing Sheftic, Rohanna and Vucinich, are also former Pennsylvania Open champions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former York College golfer Nolan Peterson finished at 76 to tie for 67th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Parrini, who recently won the CCY men's club title on his 15th birthday, shot a 77 and is tied for 77th. Spring Grove's Richie Krebs and York College's Ryan Wolbach shot 78s and are tied for 84th. Another York College player, David Boslough, shot 80 and is tied for 100th, while CCY head golf pro Kevin Muldoon shot 81 and is tied for 106th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tournament will continue Tuesday and Wednesday. After Tuesday's second round, the field will be cut to the low 40 players and ties for Wednesday's final round.
