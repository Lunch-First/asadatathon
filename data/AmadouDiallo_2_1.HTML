</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant police officers were indicted for murder. Because of intense publicity and public protest, defendants filed a motion to change venue. The court found that the opinion as to defendants' guilt was routinely accompanied by assertions that defendants were motivated by racial prejudice. The few voices reminding the pool of prospective jurors of the sacrosanct right of an accused to the presumption of innocence had been drowned out by the incessant drumbeat of prejudicial publicity. Based upon the totality of the evidence, the court found that this case could not be tried in New York City without an atmosphere in which jurors would be under enormous pressure to reach the verdict demanded by public opinion. The court ruled that this was the rare case where a motion for a change of venue should be granted prior to trial, rather than deferred pending an attempt to select an impartial jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants' motion for removal of indictment and action to a superior court of another county granted, and the prosecution's cross motion denied.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Venue - Timeliness of Motion for Change of Venue </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The prosecution's argument that defendants' motion for a change of venue is untimely because it was not brought within 45 days after defendants' arraignment (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 255.20 [1]) lacks merit.  Although defendants' requests for additional time to file the motion should have been addressed to the Appellate Division and not to Supreme Court, Bronx County, the Appellate Division concludes, pursuant to CPL 255.20 (3), that it should entertain the motion.  Specifically, defendants' motion relies in large part upon a recently completed public opinion survey.  Such a poll conducted close in time to the projected trial date is more probative, under the circumstances, than a poll conducted near the inception of the case, because it is important to determine whether in the course of time passions have cooled.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Venue </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a criminal prosecution wherein four police officers are charged with shooting to death an unarmed man, defendants have met their burden of showing exceptional circumstances warranting a pretrial change of venue. Defendants have provided evidence in the form of public opinion polls, examples of pretrial publicity and a demonstration of intense public clamor preceding the indictments, including mass demonstrations. Based upon the totality of the evidence, this case cannot be tried in Bronx County, or anywhere else in the City of New York, without an atmosphere in which jurors would be under enormous pressure to reach the verdict demanded by public opinion. This is the rare case where a motion for a change of venue should be granted prior to trial, rather than deferred pending an attempt to select an impartial jury. Such an attempt would be a futile process.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a criminal prosecution wherein four police officers are charged with shooting to death an unarmed man, defendants have met their burden of showing exceptional circumstances warranting a pretrial change of venue away from Bronx County.  Within reasonable limits, the community to which the trial is transferred should reflect the character of the county where the crime was committed.  A change of venue should not afford defendants an unfair demographic advantage.  Accordingly, this case should be removed to an urban county rather than a suburban or rural county, and, after examining census data to find counties with reasonable ethnic diversity, Albany County is chosen, since it is geographically closest to Bronx County.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN1] The bedrock principle of our justice system is a defendant's right to be presumed innocent until found guilty at a fair and impartial trial.  [HN2]  A pretrial change of venue for the purpose of protecting the right to a fair trial is an extraordinary remedy &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reserved for the rarest of cases. The case of the four police officers accused of murdering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is that rare case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants were indicted for murder in the second degree and reckless endangerment in the first degree for the February 4, 1999 death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trial of this indictment is currently scheduled to begin early in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  January 2000 in Supreme Court, Bronx County.  In papers filed November 9, 1999, defendants move this Court for removal of the criminal action from Bronx County to Westchester County, or, in the alternative, to another county outside the City of New York.  The prosecution opposes the motion and cross-moves to dismiss the motion as untimely. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN3] CPL 230.20 (2) provides in relevant part that: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At any time within the period provided by section 255.20, the appellate division of the department embracing the county in which the superior court is located may, upon motion of either the defendant or the people demonstrating reasonable cause to believe that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had in such county, order ... </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;that the indictment and action be removed from such superior court to a designated superior court of or located in another county.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a threshold matter, the prosecution argues that defendants' motion is untimely because it was not brought within 45 days after defendants' March 31, 1999 arraignment (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 255.20 [1]). &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although defendants' requests for additional time to file the motion should have been addressed to this Court and not to Supreme Court, Bronx County, we conclude, pursuant to CPL 255.20 (3), that this Court should entertain the motion.  Specifically, defendants' motion relies in large part upon a recently completed public opinion survey.  Such a poll conducted close in time to the projected trial date is more probative, under the circumstances, than a poll conducted near the inception of the case, because it is important to determine whether in the course of time passions have cooled (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Groppi v Wisconsin,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 400 US 505, 510; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">see also, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">People v Boudin,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 90 AD2d 253, 257). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We now turn to the merits.  [HN4]  A criminal defendant has the right to a fair trial, and a trial that is not dominated by a &quot;wave of public passion&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Irvin v Dowd,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 366 US 717, 728), that is not overwhelmed by press coverage (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Murphy v Florida,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 421 US 794, 798), and that is not conducted in a &quot;carnival &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**344]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  atmosphere&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Sheppard v Maxwell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 384 US 333, 358).&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Removal &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of an action pursuant to CPL 230.20 (2), or &quot;change of venue&quot; is a means of preventing this type of unfairness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN5] This does not mean that any defendant who is charged with a highly publicized crime that has inflamed public passions is entitled to a change of venue, particularly where there has not yet been an attempt to select an impartial jury. &quot;Evidence of widespread publicity, even when supported by the results of surveys of the attitudes of potential jurors, is generally regarded as nothing more than some proof that a fair trial may be impossible in the locality in which the crime occurred.&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">People v Boudin,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 90 AD2d 253, 255, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">supra.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We conclude that this case has been deluged by a tidal wave of prejudicial publicity to such an extent that even an attempt to select an unbiased jury would be fruitless.  The prospective jurors of Bronx County, and the rest of New York City, have been subjected to an endless repetition of the notion that the two undisputed facts, namely that 41 shots were fired and that Mr. Diallo was unarmed,&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conclusively establish defendants' guilt and are dispositive of all possible factual and legal issues.  This idea has been repeatedly stated in the form of quotations from prominent persons, or as editorial comment by publications and their columnists.  This opinion as to defendants' guilt is routinely accompanied by assertions that defendants were motivated by racial prejudice.  The few voices reminding the pool of prospective jurors of the sacrosanct right of an accused to the presumption of innocence have been drowned out by this incessant drumbeat of prejudicial publicity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following three examples provide an indication of the tenor of the publicity. On February 12, 1999, a column in the New York Post entitled &quot;The Diallo Case: Bring in the Feds; How Could Something So Horrible Happen to Such a Decent Man&quot; featured the word &quot;Bang&quot; repeated 41 times to represent the shots fired by defendants.  On March 8, 1999, the cover of The New Yorker magazine consisted of a cartoon of a smiling police officer shooting at human cutout figures in a shooting gallery advertising &quot;41 shots 10 cents.&quot; Finally, the record before this Court reflects that on November 28, 1999, the American Civil&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Liberties Union (ACLU) inserted the following full-page advertisement in the New York Times showing 41 bullet holes as the Police Department's method of informing a suspect of his &quot;right to remain silent&quot;: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**345]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  [SEE ILLUSTRATION IN ORIGINAL]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 4th, 1999, the NYPD gave </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the right to remain silent. And they did it without ever saying a word. Firing 41 bullets in 8 seconds, the police killed an unarmed, innocent man. Also wounded that night was the constitutional right of every American to due process of law. Help us defend your rights. Support the ACLU. www.aclu.org american civil liberties union</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACLU advertisement is particularly noteworthy for two reasons. First, it is of the very recent vintage. Second, it demonstrates that a long-established organization formed for, among other reasons, the protection of the rights of the accused, has publicly prejudged the guilt of these defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Court does not question the First Amendment right of the ACLU, the press, or anyone else, to express or publish an opinion, on the issues of this or any other case. We also recognize that  [HN6] &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the dichotomy between free press and fair trial is not resolved by imposing restraints upon the press, but rather by taking effective measures to protect the integrity of the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**346]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  legal process and preserve the right of any accused individual to a fair trial (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Sheppard v Maxwell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 384 US 333, 362, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">). &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In support of this motion, defendants offer evidence of the effects of the publicity in the form of public opinion surveys. A survey was recently conducted on defendants' behalf by the firm of Mitofsky International. Among other things, the results of this poll of Bronx residents found that 81 % said there was no possible justification for the 41 shots fired (obviously a pivotal legal issue at trial), and 41 % said the police were guilty of shooting Mr. Diallo knowing he was unarmed. These figures are corroborated by two neutral polls. In a Quinnipiac College poll summarized in the record, 67 % of New York City residents polled, and 81 % of Bronx residents polled, stated that there was &quot;no excuse&quot; for the shooting of Mr. Diallo. In a New York Times poll cited in a Times article of March 16, 1999, contained in the record, 74 % of City residents&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  polled stated that, based on their current knowledge of this case, there was &quot;absolutely no excuse&quot; for the way the police acted. While it may be that a jury hearing the evidence in this case will determine that the shooting was, in fact, unjustified, these poll results indicate that most potential jurors have already made that determination well in advance of trial. Significantly, the prosecution failed to submit any polling data casting doubt on the accuracy of the poll results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To meet their burden of showing exceptional circumstances warranting a pretrial change of venue, defendants have provided other evidence that we find more compelling than publicity and polls. What is unique about this case is the scale and intensity of the public clamor that preceded the indictments, which, we can only conclude, would be repeated at trial. At the inception of this case there were weeks of mass demonstrations at police headquarters, the Bronx County Courthouse, and elsewhere. Thousands participated daily, and over one thousand persons, including high-ranking present and former public officials and other prominent persons, were arrested for acts of civil disobedience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based upon the totality&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the evidence we find that this case cannot be tried in Bronx County, or anywhere else in the City of New York, without an atmosphere in which jurors would be under enormous pressure to reach the verdict demanded by public opinion. We are also convinced that this is the rare case where a motion for a change of venue should be granted prior to trial, rather than deferred pending an attempt to select an impartial jury. In our view such an attempt would be a &quot;futile process&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">People v Culhane</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 33 NY2d 90, 110, n 4). As the Second Department observed in the Rockland County Brinks&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  robbery case (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">People v Boudin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 90 AD2d 253, 256, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">):  [HN7] &quot;It is true that voir dire is generally the most effective means for determining whether a fair and impartial jury can be impaneled. Nevertheless, it may not always successfully root out prejudice and therefore does not always guarantee the right to a fair trial (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Groppi v Wisconsin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 400 US 505, 510). No matter how solemnly given, a juror's statement that he has not been influenced by prejudicial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  publicity and is capable of affording the defendant a fair trial is not necessarily dispositive (see, e.g., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Marshall v United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 360 US 310, 312, cf. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Irvin v Dowd</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 366 US 717, 722-723).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subject of potential pressure upon jurors would be particularly difficult to deal with in voir dire. This is not a simple matter of asking the jurors if they could put aside any opinions they may have formed. Instead, it would also be necessary to ascertain whether they could resist a public cry for conviction, and, specifically, whether they could face their friends &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**347]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and neighbors in the event of an acquittal. The very asking of such questions carries the danger of implanting or reinforcing in the jurors' minds the fear of the consequences of reaching an unpopular verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution points to an unsuccessful application by defendants made to the Supervising Justice of the Grand Jury (Robert Seewald, J.) for an order delaying the Grand Jury proceedings and moving them to a location less affected by demonstrations. The court (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Matter of Grand Jury Investigation of Deatah of Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 180 Misc 2d 223) questioned the grand jurors&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and determined that they were not influenced by the publicity and demonstrations. The available evidence makes it apparent that the prospective trial jurors cannot be expected to be as impervious to influence. The potential pressures upon jurors who serve in a public trial are hardly comparable to the pressures upon grand jurors, who participate in a secret proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We do not diminish the tragedy of Mr. Diallo's death by insisting that criminal liablity for his death must be determined through a fair and impartial trial.  [HN8] A trial in which the jurors have been persuaded in advance, by outside influences, that they have a duty to reach a certain verdict is not a trial; it is no different from the staged proceedings of totalitarian societies where there is the illusion of a fair trial but the predetermined outcome follows a script. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue that remains is selection of a new venue. This is a matter of grave importance for which there is little guidance.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendants propose Westchester County, which adjoins Bronx County and carries the advantage of convenience. However, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   [HN9] &quot;within reasonable limits, the community to which the trial is transferred should reflect the character of the county where the crime was committed&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">People v Goldswer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 39 NY2d 656, 663). A change of venue should, of couse, not afford defendants an unfair demographic advantage (Note, 106 Harv L Rev 705 [1993]). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, this case should be removed to an urban county rather than a suburban or rural county. Counties where substantial numbers of New York City law enforcement officers reside are particularly undesirable. We have examined data published by the United States Bureau of the Census which reveal that several counties containing urban areas, namely Albany, Erie, Monroe, and Onondaga, have populations featuring a reasonable degree of ethnic diversity. Since the demographics of each of these counties are approximately the same, we have chosen, as the place of trial, Albany County, which is geographically closest to Bronx County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, defendants' motion for removal of the indictment and action to a superior court of another county should be granted to the extent of removing the indictment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and action from Supreme Court, Bronx County, to Supreme Court, Albany County, and the prosecution's cross motion should be denied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lerner, J. P., Andrias, Saxe, Buckley and Friedman, JJ., concur. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motion for removal of indictment and action to a superior court of another county granted to the extent of removing same from Supreme Court, Bronx County, to Supreme Court, Albany County, and cross motion for dismissal of motion denied.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4"> TEXT:<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Summary:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this inaugural address, Professor Taylor begins with his beliefs regarding Christianity, and more specifically, Jesus Christ crucified, executed by first century Roman powers. He then continues with an examination of the American prison structure and its statistical and social impact upon American culture. Professor Taylor concludes his address by drawing a connection between Christianity and its role in countering the &quot;terror&quot; established by modern American penal paradigms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The God of Christians is the executed God. Biblical faith and much Christian theology has noted that the God of Jesus Christ - though risen and living, powerful, grace-full, liberating and reconciling, salvific - is the One who was also crucified. That God, in the language of the still-potent book by Jurgen Moltmann, is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The Crucified God</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus to speak of God as crucified is to focus on the passion and death of the concrete Jesus of Nazareth. A God entangled in crucifixion is an antidote to pieties and theologies that would seek their God above the earth and its suffering peoples. It is, instead, to know God in the humanity that has been abandoned, rejected, struggling, and despised. All this is a familiar emphasis of theologies of the cross, or speech regarding a crucified God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To speak of God as executed does something more. Over centuries of Christian discourse, crucified has tended to signify only Jesus' general experience of suffering and death.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The phrase, the executed God, reminds us that God bound up with the life of Jesus of Nazareth, was exposed to material conditions so malignant that he was executed. He did not die accidentally, as a culmination of disease, nor because it was the necessary end of all humans. Nor was it because Jesus possessed, in E. P. Sanders' language, some will to die in order to make a redemptive death.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No - he was put to death. Along the way he was tortured and humiliated. He was done in by executioners.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comedian Dick Gregory once said, with an enlightening twinkle in his eye, that if Christians understood the meaning of Jesus' cross, they would wear around their necks, and hang from their earlobes, little electric chairs. I think he is right. The fact that his suggestion seems morbid, and that many of us persist in hanging a silver or gilded cross from our bodies, suggests we have lost touch with the ugly dimension of execution. In Jesus of Nazareth, God embraced not just death, but execution, i.e. state-sanctioned execution. God, we might say, entered into Rome's and Palestine's state-sanctioned theatrics of terror, and from within that theater of violence, made life wherever crucified peoples still clamor for life.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is there an organized theater of violence today? Do crucified peoples exist now who still need life? I answer yes. To make my case, permit me three moves in this lecture today: first, to portray lockdown America and the theatrics of terror constituting it; second, to offer an account of why America is using a theatrics of terror today through prisons, death penalties, and paramilitary policing; and then, third, to show how Christians embodying a liberating practice informed by the executed God might give rise to a theatrics of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">counter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-terror. I begin by introducing lockdown America.<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">I. INTRODUCING LOCKDOWN AMERICA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my own church, Anadje raises all of her thirteen years of age to share a concern before the adults go to their Prayers of the People during Sunday morning worship. &quot;We had a hard week in school,&quot; she says, &quot;for two days we were on lockdown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Out of the Mouths of Babes . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's children and youth routinely use the metaphors of prison life to portray their own lives outside of prison. Twelve year-old Jeremiah, interviewed by Jonathan Kozol,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contrasted his own poor community (Bronx, New York) with the more northern and wealthier one of Riverdale. &quot;Life in Riverdale is opened up,&quot; he said. &quot;Where we live, it's locked down.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When asked by Kozol to elaborate, Jeremiah and other youth point to city parks you cannot play in; schools without learning where the police teach you how to walk the halls; libraries you see into but cannot go into because they are locked and barricaded; shopping malls you cannot get into because you cannot get past security vigilance; Bloomingdale stores at Christmas-time that chase you away because you look black, Latino, or poor.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is the homeless street poet that Kozol encounters in a Bronx city park, who, amid his life of struggle, dares language to interpret the whole metropolis: &quot;I see New York as a symbolic city. . . . These buildings are our concrete prisons piled up like Babel. A Satanic technology surrounds us. What we see is apparatus, not humanity.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether from the mouths of youth or homeless elders, today's prison-speak is not just the result of metaphorical dexterity or poetic license. It is rooted in the material, economic, political, and social conditions of our times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bronx children interviewed by Kozol,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for example, live across from Rikers Island  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the East River, the largest penal institution in the world. Ninety-two percent of its caged people are black or Hispanic.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People in the Bronx community and elsewhere have family members cycling in and out, know friends who have been, are, or will be there, as either inmates or employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York City spends $ 58,000 annually on each caged adult, $ 70,000 for each juvenile.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is ten times what the City spends on each child in its public schools.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In trying to justify these expenditures, an educational administrator at Rikers says bluntly:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Without [Rikers] island, the attractive lives some of us lead in the nice sections of New York would simply not be possible. If you want to get your outcasts out of sight, first you need a ghetto and then you need a prison to take pressure off the ghetto. . . . Short-term terror and revulsion are more powerful than long-term wisdom or self-interest.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>This is not just the isolated statement of some twisted staff person, caught speaking out of place. It is, in fact, a window out onto the dynamics that are driving our nation's use of prisons, and the ready use of the death penalty that is applied in the prison house. Quite frankly, the administrator is saying, short-term terror and revulsion are now necessary as a mode of control, an essential mode of governance. We thus have a Gulag  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c4">A. GULAG AMERICA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States of America has become, in Christian Parenti's words, &quot;A Big House Nation.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prisons are growing in number, and are big business. Over 1.8 million U.S. citizens are in prison.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The figure may be 7.5 million by early next century. Another three million are doing time today in an outer prison of regimented society, under care of the court system, exposed to unannounced visits from parole and probation officers, mandatory urine tests, home detention, or the invisible tether of electronic bracelets.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just since 1980, the prison population has tripled, constituting the largest and most frenetic correctional buildup of any country in the history of the world.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millions more are connected to the incarceration system from the outside.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many outsiders make their living directly or indirectly off the economic stimuli provided to communities by the lockup craze. Administrators at Rikers Island tout themselves as a huge employment opportunity for the South Bronx. While caging their inmates, Rikers employs 10,000 people, 8000 as guards.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small towns in economic slump regularly seek recovery by organizing to host a big prison. Crescent City, California, for example, organized to get the $ 277.5 million Pelican Bay State Prison,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a super-mean maximum security institution. They also got population growth, new garbage contracts, a battery of counseling offices and services (including prison chaplains, of course), an Ace Hardware store, a new area hospital, a 90,000-square-foot K-Mart, and jobs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parenti reports that yearly expenses from the correction industry are between $ 20 and $ 35 billion annually, with more than 523,000 full-time employees working in American corrections - more than in any Fortune 500 company except General Motors.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More that $ 7 billion annually has been spent on prison building in the 1990s.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1996 alone, twenty-six Federal and ninety-six State prisons were begun.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Criminal Justice Report found that nearly 5% of rural population growth between 1980 and 1990 was due to transfer of prisoners to the country, captured in the cities and exiled to the new carceral arcadia.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convention center hotels also play host to Prison Expo conventions. The American Correctional Association  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> held one of these in Nashville, more than 600 booths touting the very latest in prison innovation and technology to more than 5000 conventioneers.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">New York Times</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> article on the convention  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> discusses the buying-spree culture among those who have to keep up with lockdown America's frenetic pace of incarceration. For the warden who has run out of room, says the article, there are temporary cells at $ 40,000 a piece.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For hard-to-handle inmates, there is the latest in restraining chairs, ballistic batons, and plastic handcuffs. And for those who simply prefer to delegate, there are companies that do it all, from designing cellblocks to determining staffing, from setting up a dispensary to beefing up security.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phenomenal growth of the prison industry is often seen as justified, since it is reducing violent crime.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Tom Wicker has documented, however, the decline of crime is not even roughly equivalent to the massive prison build-up.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, the build-up is due more to locking up minor offenders, while the crime decline is usually talked about as putting violent offenders away.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No, to understand the build-up, we have to see its character as inspiring terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c4">B. The Theatrics of Terror: Its Six Dimensions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the administrator at Rikers Island put it, short-term terror and revulsion are necessary.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gulag, and the punitive measures relating to it, make up a house of horrors, a structure for the practice of a political theatrics of terror. Let me explain this in terms of six dimensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Dimension I: Time</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, first of all, the way prisons transform the human experience of time. The prison should be seen as a kind of theater in which time is turned into a weapon of terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most theatrical performances, in the interaction between the play, players and audience, there is a transformation of time - perhaps, a suspension of ordinary time, a creation of a new time that enables a particular insight, often another kind of experience.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the prison theater, time is transformed in a particularly new and destructive way. There is not simply a loss of time. Nor is this just some more intense form of being sent to your room, for time out. It </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">is</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that, and so, time is lost, with mothers and fathers, aunts and uncles missing out seeing children grow into adulthood. Mumia Abu-Jamal,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a resident on Pennsylvania's death row for seventeen years, observes about prison time, that, &quot;Once loving relationships wither into yesterday's dust. Relatives die, their loss mourned in silent loneliness. Times, temperaments, mores change, and the caged move to outdated rhythms.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, beyond this lost time and lost experience, there is a more crucial transformation, i.e., the routinization of time, a transformation intentionally cultivated by prison authorities to make every day like another. Amid routinization, the very perception of time is deadened. As Abu-Jamal says in an essay called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Killing Time</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, intentionally constructed regimens yield a hypnotic sameness.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Time in prison, then, becomes a thick, dull mallet that pounds consciousness into a coma.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a mallet, time thus yields a kind of spirit-death. The mind-numbing, soul-killing savage sameness that makes each day an echo of the day before, with neither thought nor hope of growth, makes prison the abode of spirit-death that it is for over a million men and women now held in U.S. hell-holes.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time as the devourer of flesh and life is born witness to by countless others. There is the poem by Ojibwa Sioux,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> political prisoner, Leonard Peltier, imprisoned for twenty-three years in Federal Prisons for killing two FBI agents, whose killer the prosecutor actually has admitted remains unknown.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twenty-three years have given him this viewpoint on time in prison:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doing time creates a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">demented darkness of my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">own imagination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doing time does this thing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, or course, you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't do time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You do without it. Or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rather, time does you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time is a cannibal that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">devours the flesh of your</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">day by day, bite by bite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Dimension II: When Punishment Feels Unjust</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claims to innocence by Abu-Jamal, by Peltier, and by their world-wide supporters, are well known.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many others are in a similar situation, however, if not because they are innocent, but because the forced experience of the mallet of prison-time, and the subsequent spirit-death, seem out of proportion to the wrong they have done. This is a second dimension of prison terror: to know you are wrong and fail in life, yet to be exposed to spirit-death for the error, a punishment often felt to be grossly unjust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One inmate in the system doing life for burglary, known only as John J., exclaims, &quot;I admit that I have a serious drug problem and am no angel - but I am </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an animal that needs to be locked up for the rest of his life!&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John J.'s situation, having a drug problem and now doing life for burglary, raises the question of who is being incarcerated today and for what. Politicians and pundits who justify the lockdown craze often argue that we are ridding our streets and neighborhoods of violent offenders and feared super-predators.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Actually, only 29% of all prison admissions are for violent offenses such as rape, murder, kidnapping, robbery, and assault.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other 71% are for various non-violent crimes: 31% for property offenses such as fraud, burglary, auto-theft, and larceny; another 30% for drug offenses (possession and trafficking); then, 9% more for public order offenses, like drunk-driving and arms possession.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is, that among the burgeoning number of our citizens exposed to spirit-death, the majority of these are not perpetrators of violent crime. I am not diminishing the seriousness of any of these crimes at this point. I am simply noting the sense of injustice felt by many who are experiencing spirit-death as punishment for committing non-violent crimes. In most cases, the terror is more than the error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Dimension III: Racial Degradation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theatrics of terror in a big-house nation offer up a spectacle in living color, in more ways than we might like to think. Primarily, I have in mind the way our prisons are implicated in America's long-standing cruel sickness of white supremacism. Poor people of color, especially African Americans, are the majority of residents in today's carceral archipelago.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the year 2000, it is estimated that 1 in 10 black men will be in prison.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least one-third of all African-American men aged eighteen to thirty-four are under the supervision of the criminal justice system - in jail, prison, probation, parole, or court supervision.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present, although African Americans make up only 12% of this country's population,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> half of all prisoners are black according to Parenti,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 41% according to Wicker.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whoever has it right, the figures are wildly disproportionate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disparity of arrests, conviction, and incarceration of African Americans cannot be explained simply by greater incidence of crime in black communities. The disparity is so great now, as the National Criminal Justice Report has noted, that cumulative racial bias at all points of the criminal justice system must now be seen as the major cause of the disparity in our prisons.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This report minces no words in also warning that we risk social catastrophe with this disparity.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Virtually everyone in inner-city minority communities lives with the knowledge of having family in the prisons. Children often visit prisons to see loved ones more often than they have school field trips. Talk on the street is of a kind of a new age slavery, with predominantly black populations caged and housed in the prisons. Rappers refer to the big prisons as the new slave galleons of our time.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Street-talk about slavery today, is not pure hyperbole, given that when U.S. prisons emerged after slavery, they became the major way for continuing racist domination over black life and labor.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the 1996 National Criminal Justice Report summarizes, we are moving closer to a racial abyss that has little to do with the creation of a safe society.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n61</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gulag America is a special terror to black, Latino, and indigent communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Dimension IV: Sexual Violation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prison world is also one of sexual violation. The theater of terror is inscribed into the very bodies of the confined. The media does, indeed, feature occasional discussion of prison-rape.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prison cinema often gives a glimpse of the violation. What is often overlooked is that prison culture is a systematically maintained and nurtured rape culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rape occurs systematically in our burgeoning prisons not only because prisons' denial of human contact is made worse today by greater restrictions on conjugal visits  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and healthy human touch. Nor is it only because of the deprivation of heterosexual interchange in prison environments. It is mainly because guards and supervisors use rape to divide and subdue the imprisoned population, which otherwise would be unmanageable. In other words, guards and supervisors connive with a thriving sex chattel system in which many men are made female sexual slaves, punks to other men.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, guards and supervisors themselves use powers over the imprisoned for their own sexual gratification, especially male guards supervising females.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parenti argues that there are roughly 200,000 male inmates in America raped every year, and many of them raped daily.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A movement in the prisons, called Stop Prisoner Rape,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> puts the figure at 290,000, noting that most studies of prison rape do not look at those who pair off for protection or at the high incidents of juvenile rape in facilities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The systematic, and officially sanctioned, dimensions of rape are dramatized by an account by Dr. James Gilligan, a doctor and psychiatrist working in the Massachusetts Department of Corrections.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>In one prison holding close to 700 inmates, one of the prison administrators, who was in a position to know, informed me that, out of that total number, probably no more than half a dozen men failed to engage in some form or other of regular sexual encounter with other men. How did he know that? Because in that prison an observation gallery overlooks every cell in the three tiers of its maximum-security wing so that the correction officers can observe what goes on within each and every cell.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The use of this sexual terror to divide and control the inmate population, is just one such use of violence for administrative purposes. It is further well-known that supervisors and guards also work with gangs internal to the prison system, using and encouraging ethnically-constituted groups against one another - such as the Aryan Brotherhood, the Black Guerrilla Family, Mexican Mafia, Bloods and Crips, et al.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - all with the aim of keeping the big house a veritable Balkans in a box.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is crucial to the maintenance of our carceral archipelago that terror be used to divide the imprisoned in these ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Dimension V: Execution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theatrics of terror is dramatically played out also in those rooms where state-sanctioned executions take place. I believe we need to see the widespread use of the death penalty in the context of creating spectacles in a theatrics of terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1999, we have been executing citizens at a rate of two per week, with the total of the executed now being more than in any year in the last forty years.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With over 3500 on U.S. death rows now, the total is expected to be near or over 4000 people by the end of the year 2000.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With new laws expediting the death penalty taking effect by then, we could be seeing annual execution totals in the hundreds for a single year, two or three being dispatched in a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extensive use of the death penalty is a ritual enactment of the State's alleged right to take life, its right to hold power of life and death over its citizenry. Its major function is to register terror deep in the citizen unconscious.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This function persists, even while many debate the various theories of deterrence, retribution or today's most-popular just desserts theory (Ultimately, I do not think any of these hold up). The tremors of terror are felt, first of all, in the prison house itself, in which the death penalty is carried out. The tremors are also felt and evident in public attention that surrounds an execution. It is not uncommon for executions to attain the status of a spectacle, involving radio DJs and other talk-show commentators, and then also the pro- and anti-death penalty crowds outside the prison walls.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, we do not have the kinds of execution spectacles that we had with public hangings and ritualized torture of the past. The present mix, however, of shrouding and revealing the reports of execution has a function of rendering execution spectacular. It attains a mysterious, everyone-knows-about-it-but-doesn't-quite-know-about-it sensibility. Being both widely present and applied, and yet cloaked, executions take on a spectral awe. The carefully orchestrated release of information about executions might in fact be more effective than outright public display.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Dimension VI: Paramilitary Policing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In close articulation with all the dimensions I have mentioned, we must note a final dimension of lockdown America and its theatrics of terror, paramilitary policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A whole host of other operations used by present U.S. authorities also mobilize spectacle and display awesome power. In the late 1980s, for example, massive and dramatic raids and sweeps by U.S. city police forces began a war on users of drugs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among these were Operation Sting in Miami (1986) tallying nearly 2600 arrests; Operation Snow Ball in Orange County, California (1986); Operation Clean Sweep in Washington, D.C. (1987) involving 28,000 arrests, catching 1,400 adolescents who were apprehended for minor dealing and possession; Operation Pressure Point in New York City (1987), where police once a week conducted sweeps, stings, and buy busts, cooperating with Federal agents.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps most famous was Operation Hammer in Los Angeles in which 14,000 people - mostly young black men - were arrested and booked in mobile command centers during a massive paramilitary occupation of south LA's deindustrialized ghettos.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More black youth were arrested here than at any time since the 1965 Watts Rebellion.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Kids are humiliatingly forced to kiss the sidewalk or spreadeagle against police cruisers while officers check their names against computerized files of gang members. . . . The kids are processed in mobile booking centers, mostly for trivial offences like delinquent parking tickets or curfew violations. Hundreds more, uncharged, have their names and addresses entered into the electronic gang roster for future surveillance.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As impressive as the simple number of arrests might be, it is the drama and spectacle of these inner city actions that is most important. The aim is to create a sense of drama, of total surveillance. As one sergeant of a California SWAT team said about sweeps, &quot;They see our big gray SWAT bus, and the weapons, and they know we mean business.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The logic is clear: knowing the seriousness of police plans is rooted in a spectacular seeing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interest in what Christian Parenti has called the political theatrics of terror has been extended in the 1990s from inner city U.S. neighborhoods, where it still continues, to the border region with Mexico. There, Operation Last Call,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a vigorous round-up of Mexican-looking people, occurred in Texas (1998). It was a state-wide assault by the INS and police agents, descending upon hundreds of homes, catching 116 immigrants in El Paso alone, over 600 more throughout the state. The captured included a few hardened criminals but, reportedly, just as many model, non-citizens.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practice is repeated throughout the country. The key is surprise and drama, especially sudden, unexpected violence. In 1996, border agents and local police used a massive mobile force to sweep through Jackson Hole, Wyoming, yanking Latino workers from restaurants, homes, and off their bicycles.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One hundred fifty-three of them were rounded up, confined in a holding pen, and then given ID numbers, scrawled on their forearms by large black markers. Over fifty were eventually released after this trauma when distraught family and friends could produce papers of proof. Those who could not were, according to local papers, transported to INS detention centers in a manure-strewn cattle truck.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (INS Detention centers, by the way, are a supplemental prison archipelago in the U.S.A. today holding 20,000 people who suffer conditions often criticized by Amnesty International for human rights violations.  n86) Parenti again expresses a concern here: &quot;The jumble of tropes at work in this real life allegory [in the Jackson Hole, WY operation] are as obvious as they are grotesque: mass arrests, numbered forearms, cattle cars . . . .&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employi</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>ng</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a theatrics of terror, through prisons, death penalties and paramilitary policing of cities and borders, presupposes an intent to do so. Without turning this essay into an explanation of all the historical causes of today's booming prison archipelago, I want to briefly clarify my own understanding as to why we are seeing this theatrics of terror.<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">II. WHY DO WE HAVE THE THEATRICS OF TERROR?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rise of big house nation, this house of terrors, is a kind of damage control. It seeks to control and contain those who are left behind by the American dream as a result of an increasing bifurcation between classes in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accompanying today's dream economy,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is an economic disparity documented again and again, most recently by Harvard sociologist, William Julius Wilson.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is actually a process that has developed across the better part of three decades, most intensively in the last two. The steady increase of U.S. government legislation and executive action, which has given rise to the present police-prison-death penalty structure, parallels a process of unusual concentration of wealth in U.S. upper classes.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National columnist and Republican campaign aid in 1968, Kevin Phillips, has analyzed the growing disparity of economic wealth and opportunity at the outset of the 1990s.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was marked by an increasing concentration of wealth in the upper 1% of the population. Between 1977 and 1997, the average family income for the lowest 10% of U.S. wage-earners dropped by 10.5%, while at the same time the upper 1% of the population (making an average of $ 174,498) actually increased their wealth by a whopping 74.2% in the decade.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recent studies by sociologist Wilson confirm these statistics.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While employment, inflation and growth still look good in this year's so-called economic boom, statistics on the real lives of people do not look so good. Household debt has increased for U.S. families from 59% of disposable income in 1973 to an astonishing 94.8% in 1997.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other indicators are also troubling. Over the last two decades, the U.S. has had the most rapid growth of wage inequality in the Western world.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of those without healthcare is on the increase, and the numbers of those not getting food stamps while living in poverty is on the rise.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. has the smallest and fastest shrinking middle class among the seventeen industrialized nations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While more wealth circulates in the United States than in any country in the world, a higher percentage of our citizens live in poverty than in the other industrialized countries.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Children's Defense Fund  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has just documented that according to its most recent studies of the government's own reports, over 400,000 new children slipped into extreme poverty, as many of the Republican Party's provisions for cutting welfare and social services in its Contract with America,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began to take effect under President Clinton's signature.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With this kind of bifurcation of the class terrain in the United States, systems that seek to maintain social order go into overdrive. The bifurcation of wealth creates wreckage that needs to be dealt with. In the 1970s, criminologist Steven Spitzer divided this wreckage into two types, social junk and social dynamite.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social junk (a deplorable term for any human) refers to those whose lives are broken and beaten: the mentally ill, alcoholics, drug addicts, cast-offs, impoverished seniors, lonely and beaten drifters. When systems no longer are geared to care for such ones as these, then you need mechanisms to get them out of the way. They must be driven away from the beaches, malls, and shopping areas of resort towns, financial districts, and the pleasure zones of theme park cities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These rarely pose a threat to the system, but their very being is a kind of ontological marker of a problem in a system. They rarely unite and orchestrate a potent resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a different matter with the social dynamite. This is a part of the population also left behind by class bifurcation, but who threaten to explode. Included here are the impoverished low-wage working class and unemployed youth  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who often are not picked up by statistics, but whose spirits are not bowed and broken and who intend to be socially included and will fight to be so. In other words, social dynamite </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">does</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> constitute a very real threat to the system, especially to a system made up of class and racial hierarchies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These groups have always been with us. They include the Black Panthers and the Young Lords of the sixties, and later gangs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 1930s there were the councils of the unemployed that forcibly stopped evictions in New York's Lower East Side.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controlling social dynamite yields the kind of policing, imprisoning, and executing we see today. Parenti's words are again effective:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Controlling [social dynamite] requires both a defensive policy of containment and an aggressive policy of direct attack and active destabilization. They are contained and crushed, confined to the ghetto, demoralized and pilloried in warehouse public schools, demonized by a lurid media, sent to prison, and at times dispatched by lethal injection or police bullets. This is the class - or more accurately the caste, because they are increasingly people of color - which must be constantly undermined, divided, intimidated, attacked, discredited and ultimately kept in check with what [Frantz] Fanon called the language of naked force.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the need for this naked force to control the social wreckage of economic disparity, which accounts for why we see a political theatrics of terror in paramilitary policing, runaway prison-building, and ready-use of the death penalty. It is a sinister combination of forces that makes up lockdown America. We might appreciate, then, those biblical texts that render a severe judgment on prisons.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chaplain Lee Griffith pointed out that prisons in the Bible are not just one of many social institutions that may be more or less effective in pursuing the various goals assigned them.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No, they are seen as identical in spirit to the violence and murder they pretend to combat. Recall the Psalmist lamenting with the prisoners in misery and chains, dwelling in darkness,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or urging upon us not to neglect God's own, not despising His who are prisoners.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prison in the scriptures is a symbol of the power of death, its cells of confinement and death are like the entrance holes to Sheol  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the underworld. Indeed, intensive control units of maximum security are called the hole. When the executed Jesus of Nazareth proclaimed liberty for the captives, this was not just an isolated saying; it stands as a renunciation of the power of death.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How shall this liberty be practiced?<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">III. TOWARD A THEATRICS OF COUNTER-TERROR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic inequality and the plight of the poor have long been, and always must be, crucial concerns of prophetic churches. When, however, this economic disparity is reinforced by a political theatrics of terror as we see today, then the church's witness must find a still more forceful mode of active witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remembrance and meditation on the executed God cannot only revise our understanding of God, but also our way of action, to find our own way through the terror of lockdown America. In short, the executed God gives rise to a whole spirituality of liberating practice. I call this practice a theatrics of counter-terror. In more common Christian language, it is a way of carrying your cross. It is also, more accurately, perhaps, a way of wielding your cross for liberating struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theatrics is the art of theater, the art of dramatic performance. At present in lockdown America, the powerful owners of wealth (and their political collaborators) are mastering this art better than most Christians. Christians need to go about the task of constructing a theater of actions, oriented by Jesus of Nazareth's mode of being in the world, concretely unleashing forces to counter today's theatrics of terror. What would this involve?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firstly, a theatrics of counter-terror is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">adversarial</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, i.e., it concerns a conflictive, contentious opposition. This opposition is most dramatically symbolized in the Markan narrative about the moment of Jesus' death. After Jesus' cry of dereliction, the rending of the temple curtain, after a report of Jesus' breathing his last, then, in that moment of Jesus' death, a voice says this man was (note the past tense) the Son of God.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The voice was that of a Roman soldier, a centurion. He later reappears in Mark's text to confirm personally Jesus' death to Rome's Pontius Pilate.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether you follow a tradition that sees the centurion as making here a confession of faith in that moment, or as quietly, with authority (maybe with even a bit of imperial gloating), marking the triumph of Rome over another challenger, the point is that Mark presents an opposition: Jesus and the Roman Empire. It is God revealed on a cross over and against the power of the empire, a state power whose brutality is marked by the tool of torture upon which Jesus of Nazareth was executed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This executed One, raged over and against empire, introduces fundamental confrontation between God and faithfulness to the God of Jesus, on one side, and the empire and its punitive measures, on the other. Even if one prefers a pacifist reading of Jesus, and holds to Christian discipleship that would never condone violence, this still does not destroy the adversarial character of the cross. As Jon Sobrino said about the crucified God and about crucified peoples in today's world: there are victims, and there are executioners.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus' politics were not those of a typical, anti-imperialist revolutionary, known then or now. But he had a politic, and it could be politically adversarial as displayed in the crucifixion scene. The way he believed, taught and acted, questioned the Empire, directly or indirectly.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of how revolutionary we might render Jesus' life and various actions, the cross of the executed One makes a crucial contribution to what I am calling a theatrics of counter-terror. It provokes a decision about imperial power. To exist counter to today's politics of terror, to have a politics of counter-terror, entails this adversarial frame of confrontation, contestation, and resistance. An adversarial stance and resistance to empire, then, is birthed from the very center of Christianity, the executed Jesus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, a Christian theatrics of counter-terror is also </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">mimetic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, i.e., it is action rendered in creative and imaginative art. Mimesis is a term used not only for imitation, but for artistic representation more generally. A theatrics of counter-terror is mimetic, it resists imperial terror with dramatic representation. It seeks its own spectacular character to resist the terrorizing spectacles of empire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crucifixion, as originally designed and employed was not just gruesome, it was meant to be a dramatic act. It was a spectacle to behold. Crucifixion was a Roman form of a public service announcement: do not engage in sedition as this person has, or your fate will be similar.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Josephus makes the point that crucifixions were often used as spectacles to induce Jewish surrender or to create fear for reducing Jewish resistance to empire.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Fredriksen's recent study is correct, Jesus was probably executed because of his capacity to catalyze crowds who hungered to see Roman defeat, especially at the Passover in Jerusalem.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He, like many before and after him, was one of whom Rome made a spectacle. By such means as this, Rome sought to consolidate its power. Yet, from the perspective of the gospel's passion narratives,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the time of whose writing the resurrection stories were also circulating, and from the many Christian narratives later written  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - from these perspectives, I suggest, the spectacle made of Jesus before the Jerusalem crowds did not yield the consolidation of imperial power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Granted, decades and centuries would have to elapse before the point could be grasped, but there is a sense in which the Christians, with their many new narratives of death and resurrection, stole the show. The spectacle of crucifixion, which long functioned for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Pax Romana</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to quash courage and resistance, became a narrative about a divine victory over Roman power. The executed Jesus, as narratively represented as executed God, as resurrected One and Lord of history, displaces Rome, while still leaving the crucifixion spectacle in place. Rome is rendered by its own cross of torture into an interim power. Christian remembrance transforms a spectacle of intimidation and terror into a spectacle of counter-terror. The spectacle of the cross is wielded against Rome, opening the way to a life where no more terrorizing crosses should have legitimate place. That is to steal the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid today's political theatrics of terror, Christians must again find a way to steal the show, to forge their own drama, their own spectacle of counter-terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way to interpret the power of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s effort,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is to see it as the stealing and transformation of terrorizing spectacle. The South was pervaded by a complex ethos of segregation marked by signs saying--&quot;Whites Only here. Coloreds Only there.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When an Emmet Till  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or anyone else stepped out of line, their beating, killing, firebombing, and lynching were designed to be exemplary, and they made still more potent the daily, terrorizing spectacle of racist domination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King and the civil rights movement usurped the power of spectacle from racist structures; they stole the show. Believing that a kingdom of love and justice, of universal humanity (the kingdom of God) was greater than the kingdom of white supremacist America, he renounced both the racist goals and the tactics of terrorizing violence. King dramatically confronted terrorizing racist power, on site - marching on the back roads and bridges, in the neighborhoods where people could not vote, in city centers, and in the nation's capitol.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In so doing, racist power was provoked, some receptive powers accommodated peoples' demands, and television intensified the events by extending the experience of spectacle, creating a widespread sense of revulsion at racist powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonviolence, as used by King or by any others, will always be preferred as the mimesis for a theatrics of counter-terror, because only non-violence is a real alternative to the terrorizing violence of repressive powers. This preference, though, in the Christian theatrics of counter-terror I envision, is not rooted in a simple, blanket renunciation of violence. It is rooted primarily in an act of imagination, the creative envisioning of an alternative way of being a kingdom of God, which is always near but also always not yet. Moreover, from that kingdom comes the resources of contestation. From that kingdom comes a theater of contestation where the mimesis of love and justice gives rise to dramatic, strategic acts. The imaginative crafting of these is often more demanding of energy by agents of change, and more powerful in their effects, than simple taking up of arms against enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would also say that when Christians - on behalf of, or as, oppressed peoples - do find no option other than taking up arms, then we will not realize even our own aspirations apart from some mimesis, some dramatic, artistic mode of practice. The example of the Maya Zapatistas of 1994,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tying white strips of cloth around their gun barrels, comes to mind. These dramatized, they said, their wish to discontinue use of those weapons. Indeed, they have gone largely unused since 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Haitian-American Abner Louima was brutalized by New York City police officers in a Brooklyn nightclub restroom, as they used the end of a toilet plunger to destroy his rectum and teeth, Haitian-Americans flowed across the Brooklyn Bridge in a march of rage.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a nonviolent protest, but it was made especially adversarial and effective by activists using a Haitian cultural mimesis. They used art to mimic and mock, express rage, and to break-down terrorizing ways of the more powerful and brutal organized forces. Haitians showed up with toilet plungers, not as tools for vengeful brutality, but as props in moving street theater. They wore plungers on their heads, marching with mock police billy clubs that looked like pathetic phalluses. The powers were impressed and intimidated by the march. The spectacle was especially influential in keeping the case from disappearing from public attention as such cases often do. It also helped mobilize public opinion on police brutality, generally moving the issue onto the front pages of some national magazines.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is exemplary of a theatrics of counter-terror, wielding mimesis to steal the power of spectacle from ruling powers. The Haitian-American example of mimesis in the streets against police terror, is just one example of the theft of a spectacular symbol - the brutal toilet plunger returning, a thousand-fold, into the Manhattan city district from poorer Brooklyn. It is exemplary of the kind of show-stealing theatrics that we need in order to forge a theatrics of counter-terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, a theatrics of counter-terror is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">kinetic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it pertains to, or is produced by, motion. The moving (kinetic) character of a theatrics of counter-terror is also implicit in the notion of the executed God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus of Nazareth, even without embracing political readings of his gospel, is best understood as having been executed because of the way his proclamation of an alternative, near kingdom, engaged a tumultuous kinetic scene. Paula Fredriksen, who sees the historical Jesus as neither primarily a social reformer with a revolutionary message, nor a religious innovator of his tradition, still emphasizes that the kingdom-message embodied in his person is what moved the crowds at the politicized tumult of Jerusalem Passover.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This directly led to his crucifixion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Note the kinetic qualities of the scene Fredriksen describes: the crowds met him during the pilgrimage feast in the city of David at Passover, in all the excitement, panoply, and ritual reenactment of the holiday that commemorated the liberation and redemption of their people.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executed God also entails kinetic qualities in the movement and movements catalyzed by Jesus' death. The message about a near kingdom of God, alternative to the empire, spread throughout the villages of Judea and the Galilee, running up the coast to cities ringing the Mediterranean through the network of Greek-speaking synagogue communities of Asia Minor.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The movement went on to become what sociologist Rodney Stark described as one of the most successful revitalization movements in history.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stark is a little too quick to dismiss the revolutionary potential of the Gospel for appealing to proletarian and beaten proletarian groups,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but he argues that Christianity succeeded, in large part, because of a capacity to emphasize central doctrines that prompted sustained and attractive, liberating and effective social relations and organizations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n136</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Especially under the conditions of devastating epidemics, urban disorder, and widespread poverty, early Christians distinguished themselves for putting in place a care for the poor, as part of both their witness and worship.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n137</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paul Johnson has suggested that Christian efforts, spontaneous and organized, had given rise to a miniature welfare state in an empire which, for the most part, lacked social services.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n138</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Princeton's political scientist, Michael Doyle, points out that this kind of saintly calling might have sapped the military and civic power of the ancient world's imperial aspirations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n139</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In short, the executed God moves within and against empire. A theatrics of counter-terror, moving out from the executed God, is to be found not just in occasional, adversarial events, even if rendered dramatically as mimesis, but in these as also organized social movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When churches fail to exhibit organized movements of counter-terrorism, or even to participate in them wholeheartedly, they not only fail to embody a theatrics of counter-terror in our time, they also betray the kinetic, moving quality of the crucified/executed God. Karl Barth, at age eighty, evidently still looking for some adversarial exercise, challenged Christians to organize a movement against the nuclear armament of West Germany, against the Vietnam War, against continuing anti-Semitism, and for peace with East European socialist states: &quot;If your just confession of Christ dead and resurrected . . . does not include this and does not express it,&quot; he intoned, &quot;such confession is no good despite its justness.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n140</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So essential is organized movement to Christian faith, that when the churches fail (and even when they do not), it is necessary to seek the executed God in movements at the edges of church communities, alongside them, or even outside of them. Moltmann made a similar point when he reminded us that those whose liberating action is faithful to the crucified God, to the executed rebel Jesus, automatically find themselves cooperating with other freedom movements in God's history.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n141</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hence, he calls for a political hermeneutics of dialogue with socialist, democratic, humanistic, and anti-racist movements.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n142</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interestingly, when visiting the Princeton Seminary faculty last year, he emphasized the need for a globalized liberation theology.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n143</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That globalized liberation theology, however, needs to be at work here at home, in the belly of the United States, where a political theatrics of terror is at work. Fortunately, I believe the executed God, carried in a theatrics of counter-terror, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">is</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at work today - not only being adversaries to state-sanctioned terror, but doing so with mimetic drama, and kinetic movement. It is still not enough, but there are signs, and they are signs of hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are groups confronting police brutality and paramilitary swashbuckling tactics that have made police brutality epidemic in this country.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n144</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have mentioned already the movement around Abner Louima. There were also the dramatic civil disobedience actions in New York City following the killing of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Ghanaian student shot at forty-five times by police, nineteen of the bullets killing him while he was standing in his own apartment lobby.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n145</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hundreds of protestors, including dignitaries and also Christian and Jewish seminary students from New York and New Jersey, were arrested.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n146</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is the October 22 Coalition,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n147</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> whose Stolen Lives Project  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n148</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> painfully and dramatically documents and displays the growing number of lives, mostly black and Latino, lost to police brutality. Some of these movements have church support, though generally, churches are reluctant to challenge police authority. There are exceptions, as with Imani Presbyterian Church's role in founding the Save Our Children Coalition [&quot;SOCC'] in Trenton, New Jersey. The SOCC went on to support an African-American mayor's effort to put a citizen commissioner over a police department that seemed cavalier about its shootings of black youth.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n149</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theatrics of counter-terror is at work in groups confronting the death penalty. There, mimesis is evident in liturgies at the prison wall when executions go down, in their narrating and remembering the lives of all the 3500 plus on America's death rows, in marching and making a spectacle of American's barbaric practice, especially around the globally note-worthy case of Mumia Abu-Jamal on Pennsylvania's death row. A theatrics of counter-terror against capital punishment takes on a markedly Christian dramatic form in the actions organized by Princeton Seminary students, to hold vigils against the death penalty at the Trenton State capitol, each Holy Saturday, between Good Friday and Easter.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n150</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A theatrics of counter-terror is growing still among groups who confront America's prison-industrial complex--the big house nation, the American Gulag. One of the most inspiring and effective movements that I see here today, features the elements of creative mimesis and adversarial contention that also are crucial to a theatrics of counter-terror. This is the movement of the Prison Justice Caravans, 2 to 4 in number, which will snake their way across prison-land America, for a five day encampment in Washington, D.C., to culminate and consolidate their witness to a new vision amid present prison injustice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its drama of caravans and encampments, the movement is especially mimetic. The drama will be heightened by the presentation of mothers, children, and parents of the needlessly imprisoned, including a mother of a son who is among the 500 on Texas' death row, the father of a child killed in the Oklahoma City bombing  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n151</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who speaks out against the death penalty, clergy, teachers, and laity challenging the ethical foundations of our lock 'em up and throw away the key policies, and labor activists challenging the no-pay or low-pay prison labor practices. Putting those folks on the road, caravan style, is the kind of mimesis we need in our movements if we are to build a theatrics of counter-terror. It remains to be seen if these caravans can steal the show, interrupt the media and politicians whose racial stereotypes and get tough on crime rhetoric is often the major spectacle of the times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first trait of a theatrics of counter-terror, its adversarial posture, is also present. Through these caravans, the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organizing [&quot;IFCO&quot;]  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n152</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is challenging the entire country's reliance on professionalized, corporatized prison terror. This is not just about getting more theology students some jobs as chaplains in prisons to teach a few courses there, hold a few hands, and maybe pray with a few thousand more executees before they walk down the shiny hallways of America's Gulag to their deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, in the manner of the executed God, IFCO challenges all America to cast its lot with victims of executioners, ultimately with all of us who are victims of a theatrics of prison terror. IFCO's goal is broad and deep, as a theatrics of real counter-terror needs to be. It challenges prison build up and institutionalized terror as what it is: non-justifiable, a malignant disease that is eating away at the core of our entire society.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"><SUP>n153</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, it would be easy to settle for serving those Christians that tolerate or make common cause with the powers of this age now spreading terror in lockdown America. We do better to live out a theatrics of counter-terror, remembering the executed God, breaking down the American Gulag, and restoring all the peoples to life.</SPAN></P>

The demonstrators, affiliated with the human rights group Amnesty International, held banners listing the 468 people who have been executed in the United States since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Noa Kleinman, Amnesty's coordinator for the United States and Canada, said the rally was intended to show support for recent anti-death penalty demonstrations outside the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington. Capital punishment is allowed in 38 U.S. states. The protesters also wanted to draw attention to the case of Kenneth Richey, currently on death row in an Ohio prison awaiting the outcome of his federal court appeals.</SPAN></P>

One of the local boys then dared Emmett Till to speak to the white woman (Carolyn Bryant) in the store. According to Curtis Jones, Emmett went back inside the store and bought more candy, saying &quot;Bye, baby&quot; to the white woman as he left. Curtis Jones, Emmett Till and the other boys jumped in their car as Carolyn Bryant came out the swinging screen doors and sped out of town. News of the incident quickly spread among the local black youth and Emmett and Curtis were warned to leave town before the woman's husband found out. But a week passed without the threatened retribution. Then, in the &quot;wee hours of the morning&quot; of August 28, 1955, Mose Wright was awakened by a knock on his door. Upon opening, two white men (later identified as J. W. Milam and his half-brother Roy Bryant) asked him for the &quot;nigger here from Chicago&quot;, the boy &quot;that did all the talking.&quot; Emmett Till then was abducted at gunpoint. Mrs. Wright, trying to come up for his defense, was struck in the head with the side of a shotgun. Four days later, Emmett's mutilated body, with a [75]-pound cotton gin fan tied around his neck with barbed wire, was found at the bottom of the Tallahatchie river.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVEN many of those who agree with the decision to move the Diallo trial out of the Bronx lambaste the judges who did the deed for transferring it to Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albany, with its marble-plagued state mall, Price Chopper supermarkets, miles of suburban homes and nonexistent downtown, is about as much like the Bronx as the Bronx is like San Diego. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The appellate court should have selected a location outside the New York City media market that more closely mirrored the racial composition of the Bronx,&quot; Alan M. Dershowitz wrote on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except there is no such place in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once they decided that the four white police officers accused of murdering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could not get a fair trial in the Bronx because of a &quot;tidal wave of prejudicial publicity,&quot; the appellate judges did not have a realistic alternative to Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five boroughs and surrounding suburbs, in the same media market, were out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fundamental tension surrounding this case is between white police officers and black communities. In the Bronx, where 38 percent of the residents are black, any jury pool would have to include many blacks. The odds would be slightly better in Westchester, with 14 percent, compared with 9 percent in Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why not the Westchester city of Yonkers with its concentration of black residents, many have asked. But Westchester jurors are selected from a pool of people from the whole county, not one corner of it. And Westchester, too, reads the same tabloids and watches the same television stations as the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conclusion: forget pulling together an unbiased jury in the city and environs. (Had the trial stayed in the Bronx, there probably would have been no jury since the defendants probably would have chosen a bench trial. The judges, though, deal only with the fairness of prospective jurors.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once they disqualified New York City and suburbs, judges said they looked through census data for counties with &quot;urban areas&quot; with &quot;a reasonable degree of ethnic diversity.&quot; They found Albany, Erie, Monroe and Onondaga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury pools in Erie and Monroe would be about 12 percent black, but Buffalo in Erie and Rochester in Monroe are up to nine hours away from New York City. Syracuse, in Onondaga, is only five hours away, but its black population is even smaller than Albany's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move offends so many Bronx residents not only because they fear an Albany jury might wind up with too few blacks, but also because they worry that the community's resentment of police violence will go unregistered. &quot;It's not just defendants but the community that has rights today,&quot; said Gerald Lynch, a former federal prosecutor now teaching at Columbia Law School. With the growth of the victims' rights movement, he noted, families and communities of victims play a role in trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Oklahoma City bombing case, a judge ruled that the defendants had been so demonized that he moved their trial out of state, to Denver. The families of victims were infuriated. But a major effort was made to help them attend the trials. The attorney general, Janet Reno, made available $200,000, provided through federal crime victim legislation. Airlines, telephone companies, hotels and the city of Denver helped out, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal government cannot intervene in the Diallo trial, but there is nothing to stop individuals, groups or the city and state governments from helping the Diallo family and community representatives to attend the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CRITICS are afraid that a jury sympathetic to the police will be drawn from overwhelmingly white Albany County. But it is just as possible that the jury will include a fair number of black residents from the city of Albany, who have strongly protested police treatment, as Matthew Purdy wrote in yesterday's Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firing of 41 shots to fell an unarmed man who turned out to be innocent profoundly shocked New York. Inevitably, the Diallo death also turned political, complete with orchestrated demonstrations and arrests starring politicians and Hollywood actors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outrage is fitting, but so is concern for the rights of the four officers. No less than the people they customarily police, they are entitled to fairness. In the view of an appellate panel, that required a change of venue. Maybe it did not. But the ruling cannot be appealed, the trial is moving out of the Bronx, and there was no obviously better choice than Albany. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEVER mind if the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cops can be tried for murder more fairly in bucolic Albany than in The Bronx. The real question is this: Why is there going to be a murder trial in the first place?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer -- that Bronx DA Robert Johnson brought indictments that have no basis in fact or law -- is integral to the change of venue ordered by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to practice law without a license, but the statute on the use of deadly force by an on-duty police officer is quite clear: It is lawful if an officer reasonably believes his own life to be in danger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key word is lawful -- and it was conspicuously missing from the second-degree murder indictments brought by DA Johnson last spring, to wit: &quot;... the defendants, acting in concert with each other ... with intent to cause the death of a person, did cause the death of [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by shooting him with pistols.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They fired 41 shots at him. But, again, did they unlawfully fire the first bullet -- practically speaking, the only one that counts in the murder case?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Were the circumstances such that a reasonable police officer might have feared for his life? Might Diallo have done something -- made some motion -- that could have been interpreted as threatening to the cops?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember, the law says the cops get the benefit of every doubt -- though apparently not in the law books that Robert Johnson reads up in The Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, no doubt, had considerable bearing on the Appellate Division's decision to shift the trial out of that borough -- indeed, out of New York City altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But was that a reasonable decision, given the circumstances?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last spring, Johnson said he saw no difference between the cops and &quot;any other individuals who roll up beside a building and open fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, if that's the way the borough's chief law-enforcement officer feels, can anything better be expected from the mob?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, there is a real cause-and-effect question here: Did Johnson forget how to read a law book before, or after, Al Sharpton and his high-decibel road show formed up in front of the Bronx courthouse?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More to the point, is there any hope that justice could be done with Al and his acolytes shouting in the background?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Probably not -- not at the trial level, anyway. The Bronx is not a cop-friendly borough to begin with (for sure, that's not news) and the most common manifestation of this is the routine refusal of juries to accept police testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Add the intimidation factor -- the prospect of jurors traversing hostile crowds twice a day -- and it's not hard to understand the change-of-venue decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, the officers can dispense with a jury altogether, and have the case heard by a judge. That is to say, as one of New York City's most prominent elected Democrats forcefully pointed out last night, the four cops could have put the rest of their lives into the hands of an acting state Supreme Court Justice, Patricia Anne Williams, &quot;who never would have a chance of becoming a permanent judge if those guys were acquitted. None. The Bronx Democrats would see to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing personal, but would you take a chance like that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Didn't think so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the other boroughs? Could the Diallo defendants expect to do any better in Brooklyn -- or Staten Island, for that matter?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, would the mob be any less vituperative? Would Al Sharpton be any more reasonable? Would jurors be any less likely to be targets of intimidation -- or judges any personally less ambitious?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would the politicians be less apt to try to transform the trial into an election-year referendum on Rudy Giuliani?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, on all counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true that the change of venue to Albany substantially improves the defendants' prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton and his merry pranksters will still be on hand, but in sharply diminished numbers. Then too, given the disposition of the Albany County jury pool, demonstrations will help -- not hurt -- the defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look at it this way: Quite apart from the merits of the case, the Diallo defendants are at least as likely to get a fair trial in Albany as they would have been in The Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, is turnabout fair play? Is Robert Johnson going to get what's coming to him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's tempting to think so, and leave it at that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that doesn't do justice -- if that's the right word -- to the fundamentally over-reaching indictments that are at the heart of the controversy: If Johnson had brought a proper case in the first place, there probably would have been no need for a venue change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Appellate Division cleaned up a mess of the DA's making -- but, in the process, created the unavoidable impression that racially motivated chicanery is under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, also, is Johnson's fault -- but it will be a warm winter day in Albany before he ever admits it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank God for jocks. Otherwise, New Yorkers would be heading into the holiday week with nothing but visions of Rudy Crew and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cops dancing in their heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, how 'bout that John Rocker? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a fellow who can throw a baseball fast and roll his eyeballs up into his skull like Mr. Potatohead, and because of this some magazine decides that what he thinks is important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's probably a pretty fair reading of how a lot of America views Gotham. Rocker's singularity resides in his willingness to candidly share his moronic impressions with the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine having to take the 7 train to the ballpark, looking like you're [in] Beirut next to some kid with purple hair, next to some queer with AIDS, right next to some dude who just got out of jail for the fourth time, right next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's depressing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt it is. And scary, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be dishonest not to note that there is much truth in what Rocker says -- even while deploring the words he used to say it. (And wouldn't it be nifty if some of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the folks who were hyperventilating with rage yesterday were equally offended when artists bearing buckets of elephant dung come to town to trash, say, the Catholic Church?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is Rocker's personal misfortune that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he is too short-sighted (may-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be it's that thingy with the eyeballs) to see how much energy New York derives from the friction that he finds so offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, we have our share of poor souls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for every four-time loser riding the No. 7 train, there are hundreds of workaday New Yorkers who came here seeking a better life -- and who found one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure, there's a lot of jostling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It produces winners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Especially in October.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HILLARY Clinton's attempt to become a US senator has been tainted with fresh bitterness after one of her closest allies dealt a funding blow to her rival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new war of words broke out after the Clinton administration's housing and urban development department seized control of $ 60 million (GBP 40 million) in homeless funds from the New York mayor, Rudy Giuliani, Mrs Clinton's likely opponent in next November's senate race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision to strip Mr Giuliani of his power over the funds was taken by the housing secretary, Andrew Cuomo, a friend of the first lady. Mr Cuomo claimed the move was driven by a ruling last month in which a judge declared Mr Giuliani had deliberately denied funds to a homeless campaign group because it had criticised him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Mr Giuliani has hit back, accusing the housing secretary of using the homeless fund as a weapon in Mrs Clinton's election armoury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;There's no question that Andrew Cuomo runs a major league political operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He wants to take over the handing out of money directly ... to his political operatives - to the people who work on Democratic campaigns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Giuliani pointed out that Mr Cuomo's former deputy in New York had recently been appointed Mrs Clinton's campaign manager and added: &quot;It is quite clear he (Mr Cuomo) wants to direct patronage to those people who are his political supporters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new feud has added further intensity to a race already brimming with antagonism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Mr Cuomo denied that his move had been politically motivated, while Mrs Clinton campaign team dismissed any suggestion that the first lady had any say in the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Cuomo said: &quot;Our action won't cut funding to the homeless in New York by a single penny, but will make sure that federal dollars to the right programmes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Giuliani has previously come in for scathing criticism from Mrs Clinton for &quot;criminalising&quot; New York's army of homeless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the public hostility between Mr Giuliani and Mrs Clinton, the New York mayor has yet to officially declare his candidacy for the senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, another point of contention between them could open up over the trial of four white policeman charged with murdering an unarmed African immigrant, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case has triggered a wave of controversy which last week led to a ruling by the appeal court that the trial should be moved to the predominantly white, conservative town of Albany in upstate New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a decision that has provoked further protest from the murdered man's family and their supporters, the court declared that it would be difficult to find an impartial jury in the Bronx because of negative pre-trial publicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Giuliani hailed the verdict as a victory for common sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mrs Clinton's public statements have shown the difficulty the case puts her in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an ambiguous statement, she said: &quot;I think it's unfortunate that the trial - apparently for legal reasons - had to be moved, and I hope that there will be a fair and an effective trial in the new venue in Albany.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 500 protesters, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton, stood before the federal courthouse and vowed to continue rallying to stop the case from being moved to Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Hillary Rodham Clinton, campaigning in Oyster Bay, L.I., spoke out for the first time on the case's shift upstate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's unfortunate that the trial, apparently for legal reasons, had to be moved, and I hope that there will be a fair and effective trial in the new venue in Albany,&quot; the First Lady said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Giuliani, her expected challenger in next year's Senate race, has applauded the appellate judges for ruling in the interest of fairness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters, shouting, &quot;No backdoor for the New York four!&quot; said it was racist to move the case from the predominantly minority Bronx to the overwhelmingly white Albany region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not going to stop until we get justice,&quot; said Sharpton, who was accompanied by Diallo's father, Saikou, and religious and political leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The noon protest was in response to last week's Appellate Court decision moving the trial of the four cops who shot Diallo in a barrage of 41 bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court sided with defense attorneys who argued that blanket coverage of the case made it impossible for the cops to be tried fairly in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Diallo's family and supporters say it's an insult to decide that an Albany judge and jury can be impartial while a Bronx judge and jury cannot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They looked up and saw on the bench a judge the same color as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and they fled north,&quot; said Sharpton, who plans protests there every week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting Bronx Supreme Court Justice Patricia Anne Williams, who is black, will not accompany the trial upstate. Court officials are still choosing her Albany replacement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo's mother, Kadiadou, was too ill yesterday to attend her rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his father said he still held out hope federal prosecutors would step in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office would only say it is still monitoring the case, but she would not comment on protesters' demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal prosecutors could still take over the case against the four cops if they are acquitted in Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1991 Rodney King trial, for example, the cops charged with beating him were acquitted when the case was moved from Los Angeles to the suburbs, but they were subsequently convicted on federal civil rights charges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You criticize as premature a state appellate court's decision to move the trial of four New York City police officers accused of killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before jury selection and without &quot;allowing a careful voir dire process to weed out biased jurors&quot; (editorial, Dec. 18). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But hasn't the recent trial of Andrew Goldstein, who was accused of pushing a woman in front of a train, taught us how unreliable the voir dire can be -- especially as limited by the New York City courts? A holdout juror in that case was not asked if he was ever convicted of a crime -- hardly surprising, considering that each side was allowed only 30 minutes to question 30 potential jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some quarters, being &quot;juror friendly&quot; is more important than guaranteeing a fair trial. It was refreshing to read that the Appellate Division chose not to join in that chorus.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>JACK S.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALBANY</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SINCE last week, when Albany was named the future site of the trial of four officers charged with murdering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most analysis has focused on whether a jury drawn from an overwhelmingly white county will be more sympathetic to the officers than a Bronx jury would have been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But here in the city of Albany, where about 20 percent of the 104,000 residents are members of minority groups, residents wonder how the trial and the inevitable protests surrounding it will affect a debate over how to deal with allegations of homegrown police abuse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Community leaders and politicians in this city's minority neighborhoods have tried for years to focus attention on what they say is police abuse of African-Americans. Last month, police officers searching for a suspect in the shooting of two fellow officers were accused of manhandling a poor neighborhood, using racist language and roughing up residents on the street. A grocery store surveillance camera appeared to have captured police officers shoving and kicking one person and pushing a man in handcuffs against a store window. The tape was broadcast repeatedly on local television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complaints about the search in the neighborhood, Arbor Hill, drew quick responses. Four officers face disciplinary charges and support has grown for the formation of a civilian board to investigate allegations of police misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albany's neighborhood leaders and minority politicians had gotten the attention they wanted on police conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, suddenly, with the Diallo decision, they had much more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The timing is perfect for the city of Albany,&quot; said Carolyn McLaughlin, a city councilwoman who sponsored a civilian review board proposal. It's unfortunate that Mr. Diallo's family will have to travel here for the trial, she said, but added, &quot;I think we're going to see things, hear some things that will wake up this whole city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aaron Mair, president of an Arbor Hill neighborhood group, called the Diallo case &quot;an object lesson of what we can expect if we don't correct the current situation.&quot; Yet, he said, he's concerned that blurring of the local debate and the Diallo road show led by the Rev. Al Sharpton could hurt. &quot;If they do the New York City rant and rave, you're going to lose the whole community,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO the outside world, Albany is the last outpost before New York's North Country, a city where lobbyists and legislators swarm around a castle-like Capitol and all other signs of life are frozen in the stories of William Kennedy and the lore of the Corning dynasty. But inside the ornate chamber of the Common Council on Monday night, at a hearing on the police proposals, a side of Albany was on display that echoes the angry rhetoric heard in many cities and towns with significant minority populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The history of Albany Police Department's relationship with African Americans is replete with stories, incidents and events that indicate a clear pattern of disrespect, misunderstanding, discrimination and racism,&quot; the Rev. H. Ward Greer, of the African-American Clergy United for Empowerment, told the council. Speakers invoked past cases, including the 1984 police killing of an unarmed black, mentally handicapped man, which remains a rallying point for critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proposals for a civilian complaint board have come and gone over the years, but now the possibility seems greater. It is not lost on officials here that New York City has both a civilian board and the Diallo case, but they say a well-designed board can be effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Gerald D. Jennings, who previously opposed the idea, set up a panel to review proposals. He said citizens need to feel their complaints about the police would be heard, although he said he did not favor the proposal to give a civilian board subpoena power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor defended the police, both in general, and in their behavior in Arbor Hill. &quot;We had two officers shot,&quot; he said. &quot;They had to sweep a neighborhood and look for an unarmed man.&quot; He said officers who are overly aggressive will be punished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he hoped for little overlap between the Diallo trial and the local debate. He said he thought Albany would stay focused on its concerns. As for the Diallo protests, he said he called Mr. Sharpton last week and was reassured. &quot;He said, 'I have nothing against your city,' &quot; the mayor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But yesterday Mr. Sharpton said he was eager to know more about the debate in Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's probably one of the first things we'll look at,&quot; he said. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Rodham Clinton called today for scrapping the existing array of entertainment rating systems and replacing it with a uniform system intended to warn parents about sex and violence in video games, movies, television and music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton, a candidate for Senator from New York, condemned the &quot;culture of violence&quot; that she said infused some video games and other forms of entertainment aimed at children, and said it was a cause of the recent rash of shootings involving teenagers. The first lady said that parents trying to guard their children against such violence or sex in entertainment were being frustrated by the disjointed voluntary rating systems now in use. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have an epidemic of violence in our country, and the violence is everywhere,&quot; Mrs. Clinton told parents and children at a forum here. &quot;A parent who is a conscientious parent, looking for information about what to do, is totally confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To demonstrate her point, Mrs. Clinton raised a sheet of paper and began reading the different ratings used for movies, cable television, video games and music. The audience began to laugh as Mrs. Clinton rambled through the various combinations of letters and numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ratings should be the same,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said. &quot;Parents need clear guidance, not alphabet soup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In raising the issue, Mrs. Clinton took a page from one of the most successful tactics of President Clinton's 1996 campaign for re-election, in which he embraced issues that captured the interest of middle-class voters, but offered few specific proposals beyond identifying the problem, thus minimizing political risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this case, Mrs. Clinton said that she was not endorsing mandatory rating systems that some congressmen have proposed, though her spokesman, Howard Wolfson, later said the first lady was not ruling out supporting such legislation. Instead, Mrs. Clinton said the industry should adopt regulations on its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton's idea came under quick attack. Carolyn Rausch, the senior vice president for the Interactive Digital Software Association, representing manufacturers and publishers of video games, said her group would vigorously oppose such a program as unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it,&quot; Ms. Rausch said. &quot;Consumers are well aware of the existing rating system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's likely Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, declined to comment on the first lady's remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same event here, Mrs. Clinton also appeared to signal her displeasure with an appellate court's decision to move the trial of four New York City police officers charged with murdering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the Bronx to Albany, citing a potentially prejudicial atmosphere. Mr. Giuliani has applauded the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's unfortunate that the trial, apparently for legal reasons, had to be moved,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said during a brief news conference here. &quot;And I hope that there will be a fair and effective trial in the new venue in Albany.&quot; She ended her news conference without taking further questions on the topic, and her aides declined to say whether she actually disagreed with the court decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her comments on violence, Mrs. Clinton urged more parental involvement to protect their children, saying: &quot;We could save a lot of children's lives if all of us were not embarrassed to call any parent whose child plays with our child and say, 'Do you have guns in your home? And if you do have guns, where do you keep them? Are they under lock and key?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also asked how many people had visited a video arcade. &quot;It's a very revealing and sobering experience,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said. &quot;I couldn't help but be upset when I read about the two boys from Columbine being obsessed with the game Doom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the first lady found her arguments challenged from an unexpected source -- Ben Levine, a poised, 14-year-old student who appeared with Mrs. Clinton on a panel. He first said that a good student who &quot;really thinks about things before he does them&quot; was not about to be turned astray by a James Bond game. The boy then asked what the Clintons had done to keep tabs on what Chelsea Clinton played, a question that stopped Mrs. Clinton, but only for a moment. &quot;I have to say one of the best things about Bill being president is that she was surrounded by Secret Service agents,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A moment later, though, Ben returned with a question that seemed to stump even the first lady: &quot;Would you rather have a kid being at a movie that is 'R' rated, or would you rather have him at a party doing drugs, getting drunk and getting arrested?&quot; he asked. Mrs. Clinton acknowledged the question with a smile and a nod. She than called on someone else to speak.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT'S hard enough being a cop these days, what with the shame that Justin Volpe brought on the law-enforcement community with his now-admitted brutal torture and sodomy of Abner Louima. But police are finding new restrictions placed on their ability to confront lawbreakers, as judges and political figures join in a mounting frenzy of unjustified cop-bashing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call it racial profiling in reverse. Only this time, the group that is being tarnished en masse wears a different color: blue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial profiling, in fact, is said by those pushing for a murder conviction to have been the sole motivating force in the Diallo tragedy. Bronx DA Robert Johnson, who brought the indictments following Al Sharpton's mass-arrest campaign, portrayed the four cops as a bunch of gun-toting vigilantes -- no different, he intoned, &quot;than any other individuals who roll up beside a building and open fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder, then, that Johnson and Sharpton et al. are furious with the Appellate Division ruling that moves the trial to Albany from The Bronx. A murder conviction in this case is critical to their campaign to depict the NYPD as out of control and motivated by racial bias -- a description that for years has found a receptive audience among the Bronx's regular jury pool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton's also furious at a New Jersey grand jury's refusal Monday to indict the four officers who shot and killed Stanton Crew along Route 80 last June. Sharpton and cronies (including the O.J. Simpson legal &quot;dream team&quot;) insist that Crew, an African-American, was gunned down by cops (three white, one Hispanic) simply for racial reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the facts of the case tell a far different story. A patrol officer spotted Crew driving erratically at 1:30 a.m. and attempted to pull him over. Crew -- who was driving with a suspended license and numerous outstanding traffic warrants -- fled, and was pursued by cops from three other police departments. The chase ran for 16 miles; trying to elude cops, Crew at one point made a reckless U-turn across the highway's grass median.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, his car collided with a police cruiser and was forced up an embankment. But when cops approached him with guns drawn, he made one last desperate effort to escape in his car -- directly threatening the cops who had moved in on him. At that point, the cops -- fearing they'd be run over -- opened fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crew's sister, livid at the non-indictment, accused cops of taking a &quot;vigilante cowboy approach.&quot; But her brother would still be alive today -- albeit in serious legal trouble -- had he simply done the rational thing and obeyed cops' instructions to pull over. Since when do suspects enjoy a constitutional right to evade arrest by any means necessary and with complete impunity?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it ruled that the cops had not committed a crime, the grand jury urged a review of procedures involving deadly force -- and state Attorney General John Farmer was quick to comply, promising to provide &quot;state-of-the-art guidance to officers in exercising their discretion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's such a thing as too much guidance, and it can be just as dangerous as no guidance at all. If a cop facing a split-second, life-and-death decision on whether or not to shoot a suspect, the last thing he needs is an overwhelming mountain of guidelines and procedures to evaluate -- risking the prospect that, in saving his life, he might simultaneously destroy his own career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The limitations facing cops these days aren't limited to deadly shootouts, however. Consider another local case decided last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last March, three New Jersey Transit undercover cops saw two men and a juvenile acting suspiciously in Penn Station when Amtrak cops walked past. The three boarded a train to Red Bank; the Transit cops followed and engaged them in conversation. Identifying themselves as cops, they got the men to agree to a search -- yielding two plastic bags filled with crack cocaine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the appeals court voided the drug convictions, ruling that the cops had followed the men for no good reason. That echoed the odd Illinois Supreme Court decision this year, overturning the weapons conviction of a man arrested after he fled after spotting police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois court had ruled that &quot;the sudden unprovoked flight of a suspect upon seeing police&quot; was &quot;insufficient to create a reasonable suspicion of involvement in criminal activity.&quot; Similarly, the New Jersey court implied that cops are unqualified to recognize suspicious and possibly criminal activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not surprising, then, that cops -- justly proud of their astounding success in driving down crime to record low levels -- are feeling demoralized by the constant second-guessing and vicious attacks of their critics and of judges who, it's fair to say, have never had to deal with the real-life problems of dealing with criminals on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cop-bashers have been emboldened by the outrages of the Louima case and the questions raised by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> death. The danger is that elected officials will be bullied into handcuffing the police -- treating them all as potential criminals instead of society's bulwark against anarchy and chaos.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday called transfer of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trial to Albany &quot;unfortunate,&quot; and said she hopes justice will prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's unfortunate that the trial, apparently for legal reasons, had to be moved,&quot; the first lady said in her first comments on the controversial ruling last week to move from The Bronx the trial of four cops charged with killing Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope that there will be a fair and effective trial in the new venue in Albany. The more important issue is, we have to keep working on making sure we have good relations in all of our communities with our police and law enforcement.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton did not take a position on whether the feds should step in to the case. The Rev. Al Sharpton has pleaded for federal prosecutors to intervene, and Rep. Charles Rangel (D-Harlem) yesterday urged federal officials to monitor the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first lady's view on the Diallo case -- in which four city cops shot the unarmed man 19 times in a hail of 41 bullets -- differs sharply from that of Mayor Giuliani, her likely Senate opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani has strongly defended the appellate judges' decision to shift the trial -- expected to start next month -- because they believed it would be impossible to pick an impartial jury in The Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howard Wolfson, Clinton's spokesman, said the first lady would not comment on the judges' legal reasoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her purpose is to talk about the things she would like to do as senator, and a senator doesn't render legal decisions,&quot; Wolfson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first lady was asked about the Diallo case during an impromptu news conference after she held a &quot;listening tour&quot; event at a boys and girls club in Oyster Bay, L.I., to talk about &quot;the culture of violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On that issue, she proposed the entertainment industry voluntarily adopt a single uniform rating system for sex and violence in movies, TV, video games and music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first lady said the half-dozen different rating systems now being used -- she blasted it as an &quot;alphabet soup&quot; -- has left parents confused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In whatever media, violence is violence,&quot; she told a group of about 50 parents and students. &quot;Parents need a clear set of guidelines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, at a Mothers Against Drunk Driving event in Washington, Clinton said Congress should set a national standard for drunken driving at a 0.08 percent blood-alcohol level. The standard in New York is a more lenient 0.10 percent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANTA CLAUS arrived early for four cops accused of killing unarmed African immigrant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during last February's infamous 41-bullet barrage on Wheeler Ave. in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, five Santas arrived - all dressed in black robes - and took justice for a ride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their day jobs, the five are members of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, First Department. They shocked the city with a unanimous decision Thursday to move the Diallo trial up the Hudson to Albany. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to their decision, the massive public protests and &quot;prejudicial publicity&quot; that followed Diallo's death make &quot;fruitless&quot; any effort for the cops to find an unbiased jury in the Bronx or the rest New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five judges, Richard Andrias, David Saxe, John Buckley, David Friedman and Alfred Lerner, were all appointed by Gov. Pataki. They're the only Appellate Division judges originally appointed by Pataki to the 14-member body, which handles appeals from Manhattan and the Bronx. Buckley is not even from New York City. He was elected to the Supreme Court from upstate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How is it possible they got all Pataki appointees on one panel?&quot; asked a lawyer who often argues cases before the Appellate Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Were they chosen through a judicial wheel or random draw?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not exactly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All panels are chosen arbitrarily,&quot; said Catherine O'Hagan Wolfe, who is the court's clerk as well as the person who does the choosing. A new panel is announced each afternoon to hear the next day's cases, Wolfe said, so new combinations of judges occur all the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfe suggested a panel filled with newer appointees could have something to do with motions for the change of venue being due the Friday after Thanksgiving, when many of the senior judges had the day off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are other aspects of this change-of-venue shocker that have a fouler smell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 11-page ruling never mentions that the last thing the four white cops planned on was a jury trial in the Bronx. Like most police officers in this town accused of using unnecessary force against black suspects, their odds were much better with a judge-only trial. Judges are less likely to be swayed by public pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the most immediate result of the decision was to remove the judge presiding over the case, Patricia Anne Williams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams is an acting Supreme Court justice. That means she has been temporarily appointed but not elected, so she cannot hear a Supreme Court case in another county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five judges were well aware that their ruling would cause the removal of Williams, who is African-American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's a tough judge and won't take anything from either the defense or prosecution,&quot; said one Bronx lawyer who has appeared in her courtroom often.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So a think-alike panel has jettisoned an independent judge - and used convoluted reasoning to do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision harped on negative press coverage the Diallo cops have received. It cited public opinion polls that found 81% of Bronx residents believed there was no justification for firing 41 times at an unarmed man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, has anyone forgotten madman Colin Ferguson?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson, the Long Island Rail Road killer - who is black - got as much racially charged press coverage, if not more, than the four Diallo cops. Remember the &quot;black rage defense&quot;? An informal Daily News poll shortly after Ferguson's rampage found that 98% of our readers wanted the death penalty for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was before his trial and before the state even had a death penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure, there were no massive protests over Ferguson because he was arrested instantly and indicted in a flash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When his lawyers tried to move his trial from Nassau County to Brooklyn, the Appellate Division in the Second Department unanimously ruled that a move was &quot;premature.&quot; There had to be an attempt to impanel a jury first, the judges said then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Diallo's case, the Appellate Division did not wait for jury selection. It did not even consider moving the trial to another borough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMMON SENSE tells you that if Ferguson could get a fair shake in Nassau County, four Diallo cops can get one in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up in the Bronx, where 80% of the residents are black and Hispanic, people have gotten the message. When it comes to racially charged cases, top judges in this state trust only white people to make &quot;impartial&quot; decisions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have no idea what I can do,&quot; she said, adding that her grief, religious fasting for Ramadan and stress have left her drained. &quot;I'm helpless,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four police officers were scheduled to go on trial Jan. 3 in Bronx Supreme Court for killing Diallo, an unarmed vendor, in a barrage of 41 bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But last week, the appellate court ordered that the case be moved upstate, saying intense publicity made it impossible for the cops to get a fair trial in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo's parents said the decision, which delays the trial, was made without any consideration for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like they're punishing me, his mother, the whole Bronx community,&quot; said Diallo's father, Saikou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadiadou Diallo said the mining company she works for in Guinea is sick of waiting for her to return, and financial worries have forced her to plan a move from her small E. 96th St. rental.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both parents intend to file a potentially lucrative lawsuit against the city, but until then, Kadiadou Diallo said, she relies partially on money she gets from the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Expenses here are much more than in Africa,&quot; she said. &quot;We've been here waiting almost a year. Now we don't even know when the trial is going to start.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, court officials were still deciding which Albany judge will take over the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources say the top candidate is Administrative Supreme Court Judge Thomas Keegan, an elected Democrat and Albany's former police court judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York City, fury mounted that the case was taken from an African-American judge - Acting Bronx Supreme Court Justice Patricia Anne Williams - and put into the hands of an Albany judge, all of whom are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Charles Rangel (D-Harlem), state Sen. David Paterson (D-Harlem) and Sharpton are pressuring federal prosecutors to take over the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Dershowitz (Op-Ed, Dec. 18) correctly lays out the reasons a New York appeals court ordered that the trial of four white police officers accused of killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a black man, be moved from the Bronx to Albany County. However, he is wrong to fault the court for moving the trial to Albany rather than to &quot;a location outside the New York media market that more closely mirrored the racial composition of the Bronx,&quot; meaning one that is 80 percent minority. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This implies that jurors in Albany County, which &quot;is more than 85 percent white,&quot; might not reach a just verdict in trying white police officers accused of killing a black man -- because they are white. The residents of Albany County might justifiably feel insulted by such a suggestion.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>WARREN WETMORE<BR>Hazel Crest, Ill., Dec. 18, 1999<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While it may infuriate those who have prejudged the officers involved in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting, moving the trial out of New York City was clearly appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests, condemnations by elected officials and professional agitators, and the media attention surrounding the case have unquestionably biased many city residents. Moreover, Bronx juries have frequently decided against the police officers' side, as in the case of Larry Davis, who was acquitted by a Bronx jury of the attempted murder of nine officers in 1988. In Albany County, the officers have some hope of being judged fairly.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>GARY STREBEL<BR>Yorktown Heights, N.Y.<BR>Dec. 18, 1999<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by four New York cops was obviously a tragedy. That cannot be argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving the trial all the way up to Albany, given all the sulfur in the air of this town, doesn't strike me as the great sin that the professional protesters want to make it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, there is the example of the first Rodney King trial, which was moved out of Los Angeles into Simi Valley, Calif., where the cops who beat King were found not guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, of course, there was the civil trial of O.J. Simpson, which was moved to Santa Monica, Calif., so that white folks could have their chance at putting his head on a pike - something the jury in Simpson's criminal trial didn't do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does race mean in court when those who are supposed to be the defendant's peers are actually on the other side of the ethnic fence? It means a lot, judging by the way most folks talk about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White people have been telling us that what we saw in the first Simpson trial was jury nullification, that those black jurors were not about to put one of their heroes on Death Row. If they had, they could not have faced their communities when the trial was over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops - black and white - feel that way about trials in the Bronx. The cops believe the typical Bronx jury hates law enforcement and will go against it whenever possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the cops recognize that the people of the Bronx are among those most in need of strong police protection, they also feel that Bronx juries are soft on criminals and hard on cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So cops were spooked when Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson brought murder charges against the four who sent Diallo into darkness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was all the NYPD needed, what with the horrifying Abner Louima incident already giving the department two black eyes, a broken nose and broken jaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the attention brought to the Diallo case by the arrival of that magnificent woman who is Diallo's mother, as well as the series of protest marches outside 1 Police Plaza, created gloom among the men and women in blue, the great majority of whom have never been in a gunfight and never will be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One retired black cop told me that in the old days, either a knife or a gun would have been planted by Diallo's body to take the heat off some guys who may not have actually committed murder but could have found themselves inside a fatal Keystone Kops moment. That there was no planted weapon convinced this veteran that there might be reasonable doubt when all the facts are brought to the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This black ex-cop is not of the same mind as the Rev. Al Sharpton, of course. We know Sharpton will keep protesting the decision to change the Diallo venue. He may try to figure out if he can spark the same luck he had when both those New Yorkers who were serious and those who were grandstanding came down to be arrested in front of 1 Police Plaza as part of Sharpton's demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can be sure that Mayor Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir are happy to see the trial go elsewhere, since they will be free of the daily rock and roll that will attend the case. If the worst happens for Albany, which is that the cops are exonerated, the outrage will be up there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every cop I've talked to believes that something clumsy happened on the night when those 41 shots were fired at Diallo, perhaps even something stupid brought on by fear. None of them believes it was a murder. If all those cops are wrong and there was a murder, the entire NYPD, as usual, will suffer a hard rain of hellfire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reaction ranged from a police lieutenant labeling the transfer to an overwhelming white upstate county &quot;racist&quot; to the mayor calling the judges behind the move &quot;very, very wise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state Appellate Court announced Thursday the change in venue for the trial of four white cops accused of gunning down Diallo in February in the Bronx. The officers fired 41 bullets at the unarmed African immigrant as he stood in the lobby of his apartment building, striking him 19 times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing intense media coverage of the case, the judges considered it fruitless even to try to select an unbiased jury in the Bronx, which is 38% black and 42% Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing outside Manhattan Federal Court, Lt. Eric Adams of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care urged the federal government to take over the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe the Appellate Court's ruling clearly sends a very strong and racist statement toward the Diallo case, that the road to justice can only be carried out if it circumvents the Borough of the Bronx,&quot; Adams said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the seesaw that is political life in New York, the Rev. Al Sharpton was up last March, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was down. Mr. Sharpton was leading demonstrations and a civil disobedience campaign to protest the police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Giuliani was on the defensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But last week, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court ruled that the trial of the four officers charged with second-degree murder in Mr. Diallo's death should be moved from the Bronx to Albany, specifically citing the demonstrations and more than 1,000 arrests that accompanied them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In embracing the decision, Mr. Giuliani did not mention Mr. Sharpton by name, but there was no question where his finger was pointing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What happened is, there was a concerted effort on the part of numerous people to make it impossible to have a fair trial in New York,&quot; the mayor said yesterday. &quot;When you start marching, demanding that people be indicted -- you get out in front of courthouses and demand that people be indicted, that's like the Old West. I mean the reality is that the judge, the judges, five judges unanimously decided that, rendered a very, very wise decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sharpton, of course, rejected the implication that his strategy had backfired. None of the orchestrated arrests had taken place in the Bronx, he said, and the demonstrations had stopped after the indictments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the court's decision, by five appointees of Gov. George E. Pataki, did more than just move the trial: it validated Mr. Giuliani's worldview, whether of the protesters or what he considered biased news media coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also moved a potentially troublesome trial from New York City to a conservative county where further protests are only likely to burnish Mr. Giuliani's reputation as a tough sheriff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Meyer, an associate professor of sociology at the University of California at Irvine, who observed the Diallo protests while teaching at City College, said: &quot;There's a political angle -- protecting Giuliani. If demonstrators are in the street every day talking about police brutality&quot; during a trial in the Bronx, he said, &quot;it's something he has to respond to every day in an election year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So inevitably, perhaps, some saw a decision intended to remove the case from politics as being steeped in it. Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, pointed out that in the Abner Louima case, in which thousands marched over the Brooklyn Bridge in protest, the judge, Eugene M. Nickerson, said he would keep looking for jurors until he found an impartial jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Diallo case, the Appellate Division said any attempt to impanel a jury would be &quot;fruitless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difference, Mr. Siegel asserted, is the judiciary. Federal judges like Judge Nickerson are appointed for life, and thus are independent of any political influence. In the state court system, judges are appointed by politically elected officials and must be reappointed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The judges are very ambitious,&quot; he said. &quot;In the middle level of the court system any good judge who's not near retirement is thinking in the back of their mind, wouldn't it be nice to be on the New York Court of Appeals?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deliberately or not, Mr. Siegel said, the decision also meant that five white male judges were removing the case from the jurisdiction of a black woman, Justice Patricia Anne Williams of State Supreme Court, who was scheduled to preside over the case in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am hearing in the last 48 hours that at least the result, if not the intention, was to take her out,&quot; Mr. Siegel said. &quot;You don't want to have that as the backdrop to a potentially polarizing and racially charged trial. This gives material to people who don't believe in the legal system or want to undermine the legal system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">G. Michael Bellinger, a former prosecutor now in private law practice, agreed. Mr. Bellinger, who is black, spent yesterday researching similar decisions, he said last night, and concluded that no black criminal defendant had had his or her trial moved before a judge had even tried to impanel an impartial jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cops in the Bronx usually opt for a bench trial,&quot; he said. &quot;We know the judge in this case is black, and it just so happens that the appellate court rushes in and saves them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would the man accused of attacking Nicole Barrett with a brick be granted a change of venue at a similar stage in his legal proceedings, he asked, noting the torrent of news coverage that case had received?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Zeidman, the executive director for the Fund for the Modern Courts, agreed that &quot;with African-American defendants, those motions are made and denied in a heartbeat.&quot; But, he said, that did not mean it was wrong to move the Diallo case -- rather, it meant that too few previous cases had been granted a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It makes sense under the law,&quot; he said of the decision, &quot;but I think people rightly look at it and say why this case as opposed to all the others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while he defended the decision -- if not the choice of Albany -- he said he was worried that it could have a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on community activity. &quot;Will this case be used as a bellwether from now on in a criminal case if there is a hue and cry in public -- is that going to prevent people protesting?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Fred Siegel, a history professor at Cooper Union, defended the court's response to the protests, although he, too, wondered, &quot;why Albany?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In trying to use protest to influence judicial proceedings, Professor Siegel contended, Mr. Sharpton had brought &quot;Southern politics&quot; north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are looking at the South of 40 years ago,&quot; he said, &quot;this is the kind of thing that liberals are supposed to be opposed to -- that mobs could sway the courts.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a concerted effort on the part of numerous people to make it impossible to have a fair trial in New York,&quot; Giuliani said yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you start marching, demanding that people be indicted, when you get out in front of courthouses and demand that people be indicted, that's like the Old West.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A panel of five judges ruled Thursday to move the trial to Albany to escape the &quot;incessant drumbeat of publicity&quot; ofthe case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy, the cops charged with killing Diallo in a hail of 41 bullets, had gone to the Appellate Division, claiming it would be impossible to find an impartial jury in The Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an organization representing black cops blasted the change in venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference outside Manhattan Federal Court yesterday, Lt. Eric Adams of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement, called on the U.S. attorney's office to take over the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams called the change in venue &quot;a replay&quot; of the Rodney King case in California, where the trial of Los Angeles police officers was moved to the white community of Simi Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal prosecutors have so far said that they would wait to see the outcome of the state's prosecution before making any move to take over the case as a civil rights violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE unappealable decision by five white appellate judges to transfer the Diallo trial to Albany is so rare and so illogical that it fills a reporter's nostrils with suspicion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No impropriety may ever be proven. But the aroma of influence, favoritism and cronyism is unmistakable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media are giving defense lawyer Burt Roberts the credit for the strategy of challenging The Bronx as the venue. But Roberts is also the cause of the odor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Roberts first entered this case on behalf of Officer Sean Carroll, he spent an evening with Jimmy Breslin and me. We told him his entry looked lousy, giving the impression of influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had been the boss judge of The Bronx for so long, getting all the judges to like him because he was always willing to protect even the worst of the hacks he supervised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roberts even defended Frank Diaz when I had named him one of the 10 worst judges in the city. Diaz had been arrested three times, once charged with beating up his girlfriend, and he was drunk so often in public, he had been sent to rehab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roberts praised him until the day Mayor Giuliani didn't reappoint him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Burt Roberts is the lawyer for one of the two cops who fired first and most often. As the former Bronx district attorney and administrative judge, he knows everyone in the courthouse, especially the clerks who know everything in advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And one of the five judges who ruled in Roberts' favor is one of his oldest and closest friends, Alfred Lerner. Several lawyers have said Lerner should have recused himself from even sitting on this panel because he is such a well-known pal of Roberts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This all-white panel of Five Blind Mice (Lerner, David Saxe, John Buckley, David Friedman, Richard Andrias) happened to consist of the most junior and conservative judges on the entire First Judicial Department appellate bench of 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were all appointed by Gov. Pataki, an amazing coincidence. Not one judge appointed by Gov. Cuomo happened to be picked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the more senior and liberal judges -- by the luck of some unknown lottery -- were excluded: Betty Ellerin, Ernst Rosenberger, Israel Rubin, Richard Wallach and Milton Williams, who is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other appellate jurisdictions, when there is such a sensitive and sickening crime, the most senior and experienced judges are picked to decide it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy to see how someone with Roberts' courthouse connections could have the leverage to manipulate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clerks knew a few days in advance which five judges would be sitting on which day, so a lawyer with courthouse connections could know which day to file his papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burt Roberts -- who says he has had a career of &quot;the highest rectitude&quot; as judge, prosecutor and private-practice attorney -- maintains he would never use his influence to gain an advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did not know who the panel was in advance when I submitted my brief on Nov. 26,&quot; Roberts told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never believed my motion would be granted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to Lerner, Roberts said, &quot;Alfred Lerner is certainly my friend. He was administrative judge in Queens when I was administrative judge in The Bronx. But I am sure he decided this case on only what he thought was right. If the roles were reversed, and I was still a judge and Al was a lawyer, I would not recuse myself, because I would have the courage to do justice even if he was my friend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But suspicion remains because the judgment of these judges is so wrong -- and because the consequence of their folly is to annul the sacred concept of equal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They moved the case from The Bronx, which is 35 percent white, to Albany, which is 88 percent white. They made demographics destiny. They put New York on a path toward Simi Valley and Rodney King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no precedent in the past 10 years for doing this without even trying to pick an impartial jury. They did it on the basis of a poll. They wouldn't even wait until they invested two weeks trying to pick an impartial jury of Bronx citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops indicted for torturing Abner Louima were tried in Brooklyn, where the crime was committed -- and the community was able to watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis Livoti was tried in The Bronx and Manhattan for killing Anthony Baez. His change-of-venue motion was rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the passions his act of vigilantism fomented, Bernhard Goetz got a fair trial in Manhattan. The Howard Beach killers of Michael Griffith got a fair trial in Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only unfair trial I have ever seen was when a Bronx judge -- not a jury -- acquitted Livoti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compounding the suspicion is the choice of Albany as the new venue. The judges could have moved the trial to Queens or Brooklyn. Roberts only requested a transfer to Westchester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by moving it outside the city limits, they also removed Patricia Williams, a woman of color, as the judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now a judge from Albany will be picked -- and every judge in Albany County is white!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is one killer fact here that must be raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the poll Burt Roberts took -- which became the basis for his motion -- there is a question that Roberts didn't mention in his brief, although Bronx DA Robert Johnson did quote this question in his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It asked:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can you set aside any opinion [on the Diallo case] you now have and listen to the evidence before making up your mind?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventy-one percent of the residents of The Bronx said yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They could have found 12 impartial Bronx jurors in a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Burt Roberts has disenfranchised the same honest, hard-working people who elected him Bronx DA and judge, and paid his salary for 30 years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton's efforts to recruit people for &quot;Amadou's Army&quot; - a group of New Yorkers who will go to Albany for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> murder trial - got an unexpected boost yesterday from Winnie Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela, the South African anti-apartheid activist and former wife of Nelson Mandela, arrived at Sharpton's Harlem headquarters unannounced to support the effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's wonderful that, as we stand here and fight for a child from Africa, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the queen from Africa and everywhere else would make a surprise appearance,&quot; Sharpton said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Amandla! Amandla!,&quot; Mandela, her right fist up in the air, said, chanting the Zulu word for power and a rallying cry of the anti-apartheid movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In South Africa, they used the police to carry out their racist laws, but out of that was born a progressive police movement,&quot; Mandela said. &quot;They did exactly what you are doing here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gathering was for Sharpton's weekly radio show, at the end of which about 200 people attending were asked to sign up to attend the trial at its new venue in Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State appeals court judges stunned the city Thursday when they moved the trial to Albany from the Bronx, ruling that the four cops charged in the Feb. 4 killing of Diallo could not get a fair trial by jury in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saikou Diallo, Amadou's father, said his son's rights would be diminished by the trial being moved to Albany and called for the federal government to take over the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said the signup would mobilize the same multiracial group that protested in front of city Police Headquarters in lower Manhattan in the shooting's aftermath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the cops involved in the shooting think they've gotten away with something by having the case moved to Albany, they should check out Justin Volpe's new address,&quot; Sharpton said, calling for a rally Tuesday to urge prosecutors in the case to seek federal intervention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overall crime rate in New York City declined again this year, but a rise in homicides and several other factors have led some criminologists to question whether the decade-long descent is about to bottom out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through Dec. 12, crime has fallen by 8 percent over last year, police statistics show. But during that same period, the homicide rate, which is often viewed as a bellwether for larger trends in crime, surged by 8 percent. It was the first increase in any major crime category in the city in eight years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although crime dropped last year in every one of the city's 76 police precincts, 4 of them showed increases this year, as local burglary or robbery rates began to rebound. In one neighborhood, the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, the number of major crimes grew by 18 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many criminologists believe that crime trends are reliably cyclical, and several predicted that New York, given the patterns in its history, was at the end of the downturn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am leaning toward the conclusion that we have reached bottom,&quot; said James Alan Fox, the Lipman professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston. &quot;The years of double-digit declines may be over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's police officials, whose efforts have helped push crime to 30-year lows, rejected any suggestion that the tide was turning. They said they had battled such skepticism and pessimism since the early 1990's, when many people kept insisting that a safer city was a pipe dream long after the crime rate had begun to plunge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the homicide rate rose this year, the officials said, 158 American cities still rank above New York in crimes reported per capita, including tourist destinations like Orlando, Fla. And, they said, the broad pattern of decreases in other offenses is evidence that the rise in homicides is an aberration, not a portent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, robberies fell by 9 percent and assaults declined by 10 percent this year. Overall, crime remains down 55 percent compared with the rate six years ago, a statistic that many credit with fueling New York's booming popularity with tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People every year keep saying, 'It's bottomed out. It's over,' &quot; said Edward T. Norris, the Police Department's deputy commissioner for operations. &quot;But we still find areas where we can improve on. I don't know when we will bottom out, but I don't think we have hit the bottom yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, crime is now dropping even faster than it is in New York. Overall, crime was down 10 percent nationwide for the first six months of this year, the latest period for which comparative data is available, according to the Department of Justice, compared with 7.7 percent in New York City. Crime in New York State declined by 9 percent during the same six-month period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, homicides are still down nationally, by 13 percent, although they were up slightly in cities with populations greater than one million, like New York. Although criminologists cautioned against making sweeping predictions from a year's worth of data, some suggested that New York's small rise in homicides might foretell a national trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big cities led the way when the numbers went down, and they also may be leading the way as the numbers plateau,&quot; Mr. Fox said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But several other criminologists said they shared the Police Department's optimism, largely because of a continuing decline in auto theft in the city, which fell by 10 percent this year and is considered a very reliable indicator. &quot;Auto theft is reported well because the insurance company won't pay you unless you file a police report,&quot; said Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, a private organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts also noted that the social forces that drove the crime wave of the late 1980's -- a stagnant economy and a raging epidemic of drug use that lured many unemployed young men into the violence of the narcotics trade -- have not resurfaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other criminologists said that even without such social accelerants, crime in the city has historically spiraled up and down in fairly regular cycles. In the last three decades, for example, the crime rate has peaked in 1972, 1979 and 1990, and then slumped for several years before rising again, said Jeffrey Fagan, a criminologist who teaches at Columbia University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are not at the bottom now, we are likely to hit the bottom very soon,&quot; Mr. Fagan said. &quot;You can't have unending crime increases or decreases, and the past is the best predictor of the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In neighborhoods where crime has rebounded, it is often the sight of resurgent street-corner drug traffic, not any statistical abstraction, that has local leaders concerned. In the Seventh Precinct, for example, which covers the Lower East Side, serious crime is up 8 percent, including a 16 percent rise in robberies and a 26 percent increase in burglaries. City Councilwoman Margarita Lopez said tenant groups began noticing an increase in street-corner drug sales about 18 months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think there is a connection between this activity and the rise in burglaries and the robberies,&quot; she said. &quot;There is no question to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Predicting patterns becomes particularly difficult when the period being studied is already somewhat unusual, as the last nine years have been. Seldom has crime in the city declined as sharply as it has in the past few years, criminologists said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look at how much difficulty economists have with the stock market,&quot; said Eric Monkkonen, a historian of crime who teaches at the University of California, Los Angeles. &quot;And this is much more complicated than the stock market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Monkkonen, who is writing a book about murder in New York City, said that the last time crime dropped so precipitously in the city was in 1931, when New York was reeling from the Depression. There were 562 homicides that year, only 17 percent fewer than the number projected for this year. By 1943, when the nation and its young men were fully engaged in World War II, the number of homicides had dropped to 208.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, overall crime has declined in every borough, as well as in the subway system and in public housing. Citywide, rapes went down by 16 percent and burglaries declined by 13 percent. Shooting incidents increased by less than 1 percent, even though gun arrests were down by 14 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certain places grew noticeably safer, like Central Park, where overall crime declined by 30 percent, including a 22 percent drop in robberies and a 52 percent drop in assaults. Crime also dropped dramatically in the 33rd Precinct, which covers much of Washington Heights, where there was a 30 percent drop in assaults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the homicide rate rose in both of those places and across much of the city for reasons police officials are still exploring. Officials estimate the homicide count will rise to 680 by year's end, compared with 633 last year, although the number is still nowhere near the toll in 1990, when the city suffered through a record 2,245 homicides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Norris said the homicide rate appeared to have been driven up by an increase in gang activity, a surge in domestic violence and a downturn in aggressiveness by the police after the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which provoked criticism that too many officers were brutish on patrol. The department has tried to address these concerns with initiatives, like expanding domestic violence units in some precincts and forcing more officers to work weekends, when much of the alcohol-related domestic abuse occurs, the commissioner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the initiatives, officials said, the homicide rate has slowed dramatically since June, when homicides were running 15 percent ahead of last year's tally. For the second half of the year, homicides increased by 2 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several criminologists said one factor that could lead to an increase in crime in New York was the anticipated growth over the next few years in a crime-prone population, young men 15 to 24 years old. To analysts who believe that demographic trends have as much to do with crime patterns as police work, the New York City decline has always been partly explained by a drop in the number of teenagers and young males during the last eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials resist this notion that somehow their efforts -- a crackdown on quality-of-life offenses, a commitment to gun seizures, a re-emphasis on intelligence-gathering and neighborhood drug initiatives -- played second fiddle to the dictates of a particular population decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We take a lot of credit for most of the decline,&quot; Mr. Norris said. &quot;As it goes up, I think we would take a lot of the criticism. But we are confident that we can reduce further and certainly maintain the gains we've enjoyed.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton continued to protest the decision to transfer the trial of the four white police officers accused of shooting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to Albany, and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela appeared with him yesterday and condemned police brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Mandela appeared at a two-hour service led by Mr.  Sharpton at his headquarters in Harlem. Mr. Sharpton pledged to &quot;recruit an army of righteous souls that are willing to fight no matter where.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Sharpton stood beside Mr. Diallo's father, Saikou, and accused the state appellate court of moving the trial to Albany to ensure that a white judge and jury would be selected. The court ruled Thursday that prejudicial publicity had eliminated the chance of the police officers' getting a fair trial in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sharpton denied that protests by his followers last year had contributed to excessive media coverage that was cited as a reason for moving the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We never marched after the indictment&quot; of the officers, he said. &quot;We were inside with the family. We didn't march outside the courthouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Mandela, the former wife of Nelson Mandela, the anti-apartheid hero and first black president of South Africa, compared police brutality in New York to the oppression of black South Africans under the system of segregation she fought to change. She urged people to continue fighting for justice, saying that &quot;in South Africa, they used the police to carry out racist, filthy laws, but out of that was grown a progressive police force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elder Mr. Diallo also spoke against holding the trial in Albany, saying his son had been accepted as a &quot;child of the Bronx.&quot; Mr. Diallo said he had hoped to see justice done there. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> life was taken brutally and now his life is going to be diminished,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 50 people had signed up to go to Albany to attend the trial as of yesterday afternoon. &quot;I do believe that if people do not show up in numbers, then justice will not prevail,&quot; said Joyce Oates, 55, a resident of the Soundview section of the Bronx. Ms. Oates signed a yellow sheet of paper listing those willing to make the trip. It was headed &quot;Amadou's Army.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLICE officer Sean Carroll looks at his 11-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son and says with his voice cracking: &quot;I can only imagine what the Diallo family must be going through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I put myself in their place and think how I would feel if my loved ones were taken away from me. There is not a moment of my waking day that I don't think about that night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Carroll is talking for the first time about that terrible night last Feb. 4 when young </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was shot dead in a tragic mistake as four cops mistook him for a serial rapist and believed he was going for a gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't sleep much. It's an ongoing nightmare. But then you very quickly stop feeling sorry for yourself when you think about the Diallo family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does this tough street cop cry?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course he cries -- he's still crying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll be sorry for the rest of my life,&quot; says 36-year-old Carroll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm shattered about the tragedy and sometimes feel totally lost. I pray a lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often his prayers are heard at Our Lady of Grace Catholic Church on Long Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While God would welcome Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson and Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, some of the parishioners might not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In that church I often see Elizabeth Sanchez and Patty Gillespie with their sons, and it tears your heart out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Kevin Gillespie was shot dead in The Bronx, and Officer Tony Sanchez was shot dead in Manhattan. Both Morgenthau and Johnson, for their own philosophical reasons, oppose the death penalty -- even when cops are shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Carroll knows just how fragile that thin blue line can be between leaving your wife a widow and your children fatherless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carroll remembers a hot August night at 11 o'clock, when he and his partner were patrolling a crack alley near Boston Road and 214th Street in The Bronx's 47th Precinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly -- gunfire from a rooftop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We recovered seven cartridges that were fired on us from the roof top,&quot; Officer Carroll recalled. &quot;It's an out of body experience. In a flash, while reacting to your training, you think, why would anyone want to take your life?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You think about your survival, and you think about your partner's survival. It just happened so fast. You just can't believe how many things go through your mind in that split second.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carroll, together with other police officers Richard Murphy, Edward McMellon and Kenneth Boss, has been accused of murder in the shooting of Diallo, an African immigrant, on that Feb. 4 date of loss in the doorway of 1157 Wheeler Ave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial has been taken out of The Bronx and moved to Albany County because of an explosion of pre-trial publicity which has already incarcerated these cops without a word</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of independent evidence being uttered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, Al Sharpton is hitting more high Cs than Pavarotti. What a surprise that is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But right now we are talking about the fragility of tragedy, loss, race. We are talking about Bronx DA Robert Johnson, who runs grand juries with a sadly curious attitude towards police officers who get gunned down like vermin. And hopefully, eventually, we are talking about justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think -- and I think I'm talking for the other officers -- that there has been a lot of pre-judgment here,&quot; Carroll said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We only ask for a fair and impartial trial, based on evidence and facts surrounding the tragedy. Facts and evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all are dedicated officers trying to do a very tough job. We had no intention of using our firearms or hurting anyone that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were patrolling that night to help people in The Bronx feel safe in their neighborhood -- a neighborhood where the overwhelming population is law-abiding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Carroll, who has earned a total of 17 commendations, was a member of the elite Street Crime Unit that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his 61/2 years on the force, together with partners, he has taken 30 illegal guns off the street and locked up guys who gave no indication they were going to use those weapons for hunting partridges in pear trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carroll, who is also a Navy reservist, said: &quot;It is unfortunate that people with their own agenda have turned this very sad matter into a divisive issue of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is so very sad. When the trial is over, I pray that we can get back to the real importance of racial healing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did not commit any crime that night, and we were performing our duty in line with our training. Having said that, obviously, we would do anything to reverse the events surrounding that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think above all, what hurts so much, is to know how much the Diallo family is suffering. Sure, I am thankful that we will face trial in a community that has not been whipped up by people who have things on their mind other than justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Patten, Carroll's lawyer, said: &quot;Sean, whether as an officer in the Police Department taking illegal guns off the street or in the Navy Reserve, is all about serving others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Frankly, I was disturbed when a completely independent poll showed that 81 percent of the people questioned in The Bronx had pre-judged the officers as being guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't for one minute think the overall population in The Bronx are unfair-minded. But it is human when you are deluged with the kind of publicity that surrounded this tragedy, and the way outsiders are using this case for their own particular reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very difficult to get an impartial jury, which justice is all about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Carroll reflects: &quot;How do you say sorry to the Diallo family?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish there was a stronger word, but, God, I have to say it -- I'll be sorry for the rest of my life, and my heart goes out to them in this time of their suffering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Carroll wakes from endless nights of fitful sleep: &quot;It is almost like I'm sleeping with one eye shut and the other eye open.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then he stirs and looks at his young kids: &quot;And then I put myself in the place of the Diallo family.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like in South Africa, the police and their weapons were used to protect the lies and filth of apartheid,&quot; said Mandela, who was greeted with raised fists by several hundred supporters. She is the ex-wife of former South African President Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There would be no movement in South Africa if it weren't for Winnie Mandela,&quot; said Sharpton, bringing the Harlem audience to their feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's U.S. visit did not come without controversy. She and her entourage were detained for several hours at JFK Airport Friday after immigration officials claimed she did not have a valid visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several dozen telephone calls to congressmen and State Department officials, Mandela was allowed in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't need anyone's permission to see my children here in Harlem,&quot; said Mandela. &quot;No CIA, no FBI or agent will keep me from my family,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking at the rally was Diallo's father, Saikou, who appealed to the feds to reverse the change of venue in his son's murder trial, which was moved from The Bronx to Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Amadou ... lived in The Bronx. In the name of Allah and in the name of God, please let his community hear his case,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton's pulpit sermon left supporters chanting, &quot;No back door for the Diallo Four.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Amadou's life was brutally taken -- now his right is being taken,&quot; said Sharpton.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHN J. CLYNE was the kind of a judge who could scare the hell out of innocent bystanders -- and if you were guilty, well, just forget about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He left Albany County Court criminal in March 1984 -- long before most of the folks he had packed off to prison would again breathe free air -- and died last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's no exaggeration to suggest he'll be in attendance when the cops charged in the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> go on trial in the capital city. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Clyne's imprint remains on every aspect of Albany law enforcement -- just as the county's mark was on Clyne long before he set the standard by which the local electorate judges all jurists today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is to say, before he became the model for all the judges mentioned as a potential presiding justice for the Diallo trial -- especially state Supreme Court Justice Thomas W. Keegan and Albany County Court Judges Thomas Breslin and Larry Rosen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they were young, every aspiring judge in town wanted to be just like John J. Clyne. He was fair, but tough -- felons rarely caught a break. Cops loved him. District attorneys were in awe of him. Defense lawyers, for the most part, were on their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Years ago, a prominent prosecutor told a tale out of school: State troopers had been making record drug busts in Albany bus terminals and Thruway exits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A run of good luck, went the official line. Nonsense, said the prosecutor: &quot;The troopers always followed drug-runners to Albany County, and busted them here, because they wanted John on the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clyne rarely disappointed, and as a result he was hugely popular with the voters of a reflexively conservative county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of this was lost on the succeeding generation. Liberal lawyers rarely aspire to the bench in Albany County, because they know the voters simply won't have them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, because the jury pool is culled largely from the voter-registration books, the Diallo cops could not possibly have caught a bigger break than a change of venue to Albany County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They may be defendants, but first they are cops. This counts for everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A defense lawyer named Terry Kindlon once represented a cop charged in a felony brutality case: &quot;The jury was out four hours and completely acquitted the cop -- who was black, by the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Race doesn't matter here in cases like this. Being a cop does. It matters a lot,&quot; Kindlon says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's something else that matters: While violent crime was dropping in New York City, it was rising upstate. Rudy Giuliani and the NYPD were chasing the bad guys north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was noticed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do a word-association test with jurors here,&quot; says Kindlon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Say 'The Bronx,' and they'll say 'crime.' Say it again, and they'll say 'drugs.' Say it again, and they'll say '9-mm pistol.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jurors here are either Giuliani Republicans or Democrats who wish they were,&quot; adds Kindlon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John J. Clyne would have fallen into the latter category -- having been one of the last hard-core Irish-Catholic Democrats in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he would have been very comfortable smoking cigars with our mayor. As for the voters -- that is, as for the jury pool -- just wait and see how Hillary Rodham Clinton fares next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Diallo cops, of course.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL is fundamental to the American justice system. It seeks to ensure that defendants - innocent until proven guilty - are not railroaded into prison by those who enter the jury box with their minds made up. Nothing is more important than that protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the conclusion reached by a state court Thursday that there was no possibility for a fair trial in the Bronx - or anywhere else in New York City - for the four police officers charged with the murder of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was hasty and unconvincing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing that the trial would be moved upstate, to Albany County, the five-member panel of the state Supreme Court Appellate Division wrote, &quot;A pretrial change of venue . . . is an extraordinary remedy reserved for the rarest of cases. The case of the four police officers accused of murdering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is that rare case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, a trial in the Bronx would have been a difficult enterprise. The intense publicity and the raw emotions that surrounded the case last February, when the unarmed Diallo was shot at 41 times and killed by the undercover officers - will no doubt be on display again when the case goes to trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the court dealt with those problems by swinging the pendulum too far in the other direction. Most troubling, its 12-page decision gives credence to a public opinion poll commissioned by the defense that purports to show that most New Yorkers have made up their minds - the cops are guilty. The ruling also alludes to newspaper stories and columns, cartoons and advocacy ads as proof that impaneling a fair jury isn't possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It even faults the prosecution for not introducing a poll of its own. That seems to lower the bar too far on a very high standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other high-profile cases have been moved, of course. Timothy McVeigh's trial for the Oklahoma City bombing was moved to Denver. The 1992 Rodney King trial was moved from Los Angeles to Simi Valley, Calif. The rationale is that passions are so high that a fair trial for the defense would be imperiled. But as the King case proved, changing the venue does not ensure that justice will be served.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bronx juries are notorious for being tough on cops. But the notion that 12 jurors could not be found anywhere in a city of 7.4 million people is troubling. As is the court's solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling notes that &quot;within reasonable limits, the community to which the trial is transferred should reflect the character of the county where the crime was committed.&quot; But if race is one of the issues the court had in mind, then Albany County, with an 89% white population, doesn't qualify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellate panel tried to show that its choice confers no favor upon the defendants. &quot;A change of venue,&quot; it wrote, &quot;should, of course, not afford defendants an unfair demographic advantage.&quot; Apparently, that's not how the defense sees it. After making noises about bypassing a Bronx jury trial for a so-called bench trial with a judge, lawyers for the four cops now are considering a jury trial in seemingly sympathetic Albany. Sounds like they sure see a demographic advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the Diallo family, friends and neighbors to Bronx prosecutors to advocates, the venue change came as a shock. Alluding to the Rodney King trial, the Rev. Al Sharpton complained, &quot;This is the Simi Valley strategy. It undercuts people's confidence in the judicial system.&quot; He has a point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a chance the court is right - that a jury of open-minded citizens couldn't be found in the Bronx. But the court jumped the gun by reaching that conclusion before jury selection could begin. It is in that complicated and arduous process that the prosecution and defense get to question potential jurors on fitness for fairness. If it becomes clear that a fair jury cannot be found, then a change-of-venue request is more than reasonable. The court, unfortunately, didn't have the patience to wait, saying that, &quot;In our view, such an attempt would be a futile process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision cannot be appealed. Thankfully, this is a rare occurrence. But by the reasoning presented in this decision, New York courts could turn into an unsettling game of legal musical chairs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like it or not, a community has no rights in a criminal trial. The only ones who have constitutional rights are the defendants, who face conviction and imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court Appellate Division in New York made the correct decision in moving the trial of the four police officers accused of murdering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> out of the Bronx. The public is entitled to a fair trial, but not to a trial in a particular location that favors a desired outcome. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conducting this trial in the Bronx ran the risk of making it a trial of the police for what they have done to the community over a long period of time. But there is only one constitutionally permissible issue in this trial or any other: Are these particular defendants individually guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the specific crime charged?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These defendants, like all others, have the right to a trial free of prejudicial publicity or the fear that a not-guilty verdict would lead to recriminations or unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had the case been tried in the Bronx, the defendants would almost certainly have waived their right to a jury trial and elected to be tried by a judge, as every policeman facing felony trials in the Bronx has done since 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to waive a jury would have been based on the realistic fear that most residents of the Bronx had already made up their minds that the defendants were guilty. The reality that a jury trial would not have happened in the Bronx should come as no surprise to those who are most loudly protesting the decision to move the trial: they have been among those most loudly proclaiming the guilt of the defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors should never have to fear that a conscientious vote to acquit might have a negative effect on their personal lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A trial in the Bronx might well have become a we-they confrontation. And a vote to acquit would have been seen by neighbors as a vote against the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bronx jurors might also have feared that an acquittal could spark the kind of incendiary response in their neighborhood that took place in Los Angeles after the initial acquittals of the policemen who beat Rodney King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, a dominant theme of the pretrial publicity has been to present this killing as part of a pattern of police abuse. And, indeed, I don't want to dispute the widespread perception that there is police misconduct and that some police officers in the Bronx have improperly used excessive, even lethal, force against some black residents. But that is irrelevant to finding whether these defendants murdered this victim on that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communities have the power to vindicate their collective interests in a wide variety of ways: through demonstrations, elections, advertisements and education. But they have no right to use a criminal trial of individual defendants for such a purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the message of the appellate court may well be that the more a community seeks to turn a criminal trial into a forum for addressing general grievances, the more likely it is to lose its jurisdiction of that trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To agree with the court's decision to move the trial out of the Bronx is not necessarily to agree with its decision to move it to Albany County, where the racial composition of the jury pool is likely to be quite different from what it would have been in the Bronx. There are three variables at play in the decision to move this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first is the nature and extent of the pretrial publicity. Albany is a different media market, served by newspapers and television stations not based in New York City, and that means the move there considerably reduces the likelihood of news coverage having already affected jurors' opinions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second variable is the fear of personal consequences to jurors, which is also alleviated by the move to Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third variable, the racial composition of the jury pool, is much more controversial. It would be wrong for a court to presume that black jurors uninfluenced by local media could not render a fair judgment in a case involving white policemen who were accused of shooting a black civilian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court has ruled that a defense attorney could not challenge black jurors on the basis of race alone in order to secure a &quot;whiter&quot; jury. Yet this is the effect of a move from the Bronx, which is less than 20 percent white, to Albany, which is more than 85 percent white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellate court should have selected a location outside the New York City media market that more closely mirrored the racial composition of the Bronx. This would have assured that the move would change only the constitutionally relevant variables. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty thousand dollars. That was the price of a poll of Bronx jurors that defense lawyers for the four officers charged with second-degree murder in the killing of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> thought they needed to support their motion for a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a lot of money for a defense team already facing hefty legal costs, and it was a long shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But two of the lawyers representing Officer Sean Carroll -- Burton B. Roberts and Bennett M. Epstein -- argued strenuously that the poll was worth it. Mr. Roberts said yesterday that he even found someone -- whom he would not name -- to pay for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Burt and I saw it as really preventing a lynching,&quot; Mr. Epstein said of the motion, which he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll was done, and so was the motion, and on Thursday, the costly tactic paid off. The State Supreme Court's Appellate Division ruled that the trial should be moved to Albany. The court agreed -- partly on the basis of the poll -- that passions about the case made the selection of an impartial jury in New York City impossible. The poll said, among other things, that 81 percent of potential Bronx jurors believed there was &quot;no justification possible&quot; for the police officers' firing 41 shots at Mr. Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Roberts, a former chief administrative justice of the Bronx, and for Mr. Epstein, his former law clerk, it was a career-capping moment. &quot;We came riding back from the sunset,&quot; Mr. Epstein joked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Mr. Roberts, the glory was built, to an extent, on repudiating the place and the jurors he presided over as administrative justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For nearly three decades, Mr. Roberts had prowled the Bronx courts -- he was district attorney before his appointment to the bench -- and he had defended its jurors against accusations that they were out of step with the rest of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this legal victory rested in part on the notion that the Bronx is &quot;a place in which large numbers of people harbor an inherent distrust or even hatred of the police,&quot; in the words of the motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, who roundly condemned the appellate court's decision, called Mr. Roberts's position &quot;a complete absurdity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Certainly I am loath to diminish former Judge Roberts,&quot; Mr. Ferrer added, &quot;but his previous statements spread on the public record over a number of decades are at wide variance with his present statements as defense counsel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Mr. Roberts denied there was any contradiction. &quot;I believe strongly that if ever a case merited a change of venue, this case certainly did,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mentioned the case of Larry Davis, who was acquitted by a Bronx jury of the attempted murder of nine police officers in 1988. He called that a &quot;strange verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Roberts also said Bronx juries seemed to acquit more frequently on gun and drug charges, which usually rely on police officers' testimony, which suggests &quot;there is maybe a feeling against police officers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he said, that did not mean every police officer should be entitled to a change of venue. The pretrial publicity in the Diallo case was exceptional, he said. &quot;The whole city was infected with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other cases, he said, &quot;you could question jurors -- you could have peremptory challenges.&quot; But in this case, he said, the taint was too great.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bronx,&quot; he added, &quot;should not be disenfranchised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the clamor that the appellate decision did just that continued yesterday. The Rev. Al Sharpton joined about 50 protesters and the Diallo family in a protest outside the Bronx County Courthouse, and the Diallo family also met with the Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Reed, a spokesman for Mr. Johnson, said the district attorney told the family that the court's decision appeared to be unappealable, but that if a legal basis to appeal could be found, the office would pursue it. Court officials still were unsure when the trial would begin. It had been set to start Jan. 3 in the Bronx. A judge in Albany must be selected, and then given time to become familiar with the case. Previous rulings in the case would stand, but pending issues, like whether the prosecution should be required to turn over reports of the expert witnesses it plans to use, will be up to the new judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Roberts, who withdrew as the lead attorney in the case last month, said: &quot;I really commend the Appellate Division for the wisdom and courage they displayed. I can't praise them enough.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision by a state appellate court to move the criminal trial of four New York City police officers charged with the killing of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to Albany County seems unjustified. The accused officers are presumed innocent and deserve a fair and impartial trial, but there is no evidence that the people of the Bronx and New York City cannot be trusted with this trial. Moving the trial to Albany, a predominantly white area, could lessen the respect with which many residents of New York City view the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the law, crimes are to be tried in the communities where they are committed. The community has a legitimate interest in observing the trial and seeing that the judicial process is open and fair. Only in the rarest of cases have courts allowed a change in venue on grounds that the defendants cannot get a fair trial by an impartial jury because of prejudicial publicity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The appellate court argued that the Diallo shooting &quot;is that rare case.&quot; But its reasoning is inadequate. The court approved the transfer to Albany before beginning jury selection. Instead of allowing a careful voir dire process to weed out biased jurors, the court baldly declared that even making an attempt to find unbiased jurors would be &quot;fruitless.&quot; It is simply not credible that there are not a dozen people in the Bronx who have the fairness and courage to resist community pressures to render a verdict based on the evidence, when no effort has been made to test the prospective jury pool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court based its ruling on what it calls a &quot;tidal wave of prejudicial publicity.&quot; It cited a New Yorker magazine cover showing a police officer firing at a cutout target in human shape at a carnival shooting gallery, a column in The New York Post, and a newspaper ad by the American Civil Liberties Union that showed 41 bullet holes for the 41 shots fired at Mr. Diallo. The court fails to mention the large quantity of balanced press coverage about the defendants, their job records and various scenarios that might explain the shooting. The court also pointed to demonstrations after the shooting and public opinion polls as indicative of a prejudicial atmosphere. But those do not bear on whether impartial jurors can be found in the Bronx who can do their duty as required by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many highly publicized, politically charged cases -- from the trial of the officers charged with attacking Abner Louima to the World Trade Center bombing -- were not transferred to other venues. Even if the court was worried that passions are too high in the borough where the shooting occurred, the choice of Albany, a community that does not in any way resemble the Bronx, is inappropriate. The court could have moved the trial to Manhattan, Queens or Brooklyn, where surely 12 fair-minded jurors could have been found. By moving the trial without making any effort to find unbiased jurors in the Bronx, the court may heighten suspicions in minority communities about the fairness of the criminal justice system. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALBANY, Dec. 17</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bronx will never be confused with Albany County, a place where cornfields and deer are more common sights than body shops, and their differences could have a profound effect on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting case, sent here by an appellate court order on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court dropped the case into a place where the jury pool is overwhelmingly white and inclined to accept the police version of events. Albany County's prosecutors have one of the highest conviction rates in the state, but in criminal cases against police officers, the defendants usually walk free. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the few similarities is that the city of Albany is roiled on occasion by racial resentment, often aimed at the police. But even those passions are different in quality and in kind from racial tensions in the Bronx. The black community is concentrated in a handful of tumbledown neighborhoods in this city of 94,000 people, and is poorly represented in officialdom. The county's white majority is largely middle-class, lives mostly in quiet suburbs and small towns and is largely oblivious to the hostility in minority communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court granted a change of venue to the four white New York City officers charged with murdering Mr. Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, on Feb. 4 in the Soundview section of the Bronx. The defense contends that the officers mistakenly thought Mr. Diallo was armed, and that they only shot in the mistaken belief that he was reaching for a gun. In seeking to move the case, the lawyers argued that the intense publicity about the shooting would prevent a fair hearing in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time and again, when police officers here have been accused of misconduct, they have been cleared in court. Lawyers say that while prosecuting officers is difficult anywhere, it has been more challenging here than most places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I were a defense lawyer, I don't think I could pick a better spot than Albany County to present a case&quot; like the Diallo case, said Terence L. Kindlon, a prominent lawyer who has tried several lawsuits against the police here. &quot;There is a demonstrated willingness on the part of people who serve on juries here to understand things from a police perspective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one very high-profile case, two white Albany officers were acquitted last March of beating a handcuffed black college student, Jermaine Henderson, in the garage of a police station, and critics accused the district attorney of sabotaging the prosecution. The student, expected to be the star witness in the trial, did not testify because the district attorney refused to give him immunity from prosecution for his role in a bar fight that had led to his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been very few convictions at trial of police officers in Albany County in my 30 years of practicing law,&quot; said the special prosecutor in the Henderson case, John E. Dorfman, a lawyer in private practice. &quot;Quite honestly, I can only recall one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larry Wiest, chief assistant district attorney, agreed with Mr. Kindlon that this is a place where people are inclined to trust authority, a marked contrast to the Bronx, whose juries are known for being suspicious of those in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The county of Albany as a whole is, I'm sure, a lot more parochial than the Bronx, and so their trust of the police is probably a lot more favorable than what the attitude might be in the Bronx,&quot; Mr. Wiest said. &quot;For years, state police, when they were chasing someone, would try to catch them in Albany County, because they were so sure of the conviction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The district attorney's office does not keep figures on cases against officers, and Mr. Wiest said, &quot;I can't generalize and say that you can't convict an officer here.&quot; But like Mr. Dorfman, he was able to cite only one officer who was convicted in the past decade out of a number who were tried. He listed several others who accepted plea bargains, but most were not accused of misconduct in the line of duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one recent case, an Albany detective charged with stealing cocaine from a drug arrest was acquitted of most charges and the jury deadlocked on the remaining count. That charge was later plea-bargained down to a misdemeanor, and the detective served no time in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when officers have not been the defendants, convictions have been easier. Year after year, Albany County has one of the state's highest conviction rates and the Bronx has one of the lowest, according to the state's Division of Criminal Justice Services. Most criminal cases end in plea bargains, but of the defendants who went to trial last year, 90 percent were convicted in Albany County, 71 percent were convicted statewide, and 53 percent were convicted in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of Albany County's 293,000 residents, 10 percent are black, 2 percent are Hispanic, and 86 percent are non-Hispanic white, according to the Census Bureau, which does not count Hispanic as a race. That makes it one of the most racially diverse counties upstate, but still a far cry from the Bronx, which is 42 percent black, 48 percent Hispanic, and just 19 percent non-Hispanic white. All of the judges on the county bench in Albany are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many black people here say they are treated callously by the police, a view that was reinforced by the Henderson case and, more acutely, by the tactics the police used last month in searching for a black man accused of shooting two officers, who survived. A large police contingent, heavily armed and armored, swept through the mostly black Arbor Hill neighborhood, and there were allegations that they roughed up some residents. The suspect in the shooting, Tracy Grady, is still at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local black residents still refer angrily to the death of Jessie Davis, a schizophrenic black man who was shot by police officers in his apartment here in 1984. The officers said he had menaced them with a knife and a large meat fork, but his family insisted that he was unarmed. A grand jury declined to indict the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while people in Albany tended to respond hazily when asked today about the Diallo case, black residents knew all about it. &quot;Most people of color know about Diallo because it's such an injustice,&quot; said Gloria Reese, 54, the black owner of a hair salon in Arbor Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White people were more detached about the case. &quot;I don't think it affects people one way or the other,&quot; said Lon Palatsky, 36, a white computer technician who works for the state. &quot;New York City is like another state -- we're far removed from them.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In all likelihood, the announcement ... will be made early next week,&quot; said David Bookstaver, spokesman for the state Office of Court Administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new judge will replace Bronx Supreme Court Justice Patricia Ann Williams. A state appeals panel this week ordered the trial moved to Albany, ruling that the jury pool in New York was tainted by media coverage of the shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A top candidate for the job is Administrative Judge Thomas Keegan, the top-ranking judge for Albany County and its six surrounding counties, according to legal sources familiar with the judicial system there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new judge may also be chosen from a small group of Albany judges with the most experience handling felony cases: Thomas Breslin, Larry Rosen and Dan Lamont, the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appointment will be made by Judge Joseph Traficanti Jr., the deputy chief administrative judge for the state courts outside New York City, in consultation with state Chief Administrative Judge Jonathan Lippman, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for the four police officers accused of murder in the Feb. 4 shooting death of the unarmed Diallo said they don't expect the trial to begin until weeks after the original Jan. 3 starting date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new judge must also rule on several lingering issues before the trial can begin -- including the contents of a questionnaire for prospective jurors and the defense claim that Bronx prosecutors are taking too long to turn over the names of witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Diallo's parents continued to decry the venue change, and the Rev. Al Sharpton demanded that federal prosecutors indict the four officers for violating Diallo's civil rights -- taking the case over from Bronx prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the feds would step in only if the upcoming trial ends in acquittal, and a review of the evidence supports the need for federal criminal civil rights charges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A two-day special session was called solely to consider a flood relief package proposed by Gov. Jim Hunt. The package includes $ 350.2 million for housing; $ 232.4 million to match federal disaster spending; $ 213.4 million to help small businesses, agriculture and commercial fishermen; $ 27.7 million for environmental cleanup; and $ 6.3 million to help local governments with lost revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hurricane Floyd destroyed or damaged 12,000 homes and caused more than $ 6 billion in damage in North Carolina when it hit the coast in September. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Bonfire reportedly exceeded height limit<BR>When it collapsed, the Texas A&amp;M University bonfire stack was already 4 feet taller than the 55-foot limit set by university officials and, if completed, might have reached 75 feet, a university instructor said. John Weese, a mechanical engineering instructor, estimated that the first four tiers of the log stack were 59 feet tall when they fell Nov. 18, killing 12 people and injuring 27. A fifth tier, which had not been started, would have added 9 feet, and the crowning outhouse would have raised the tower to about 75 feet, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They pointed to demonstrations outside Police Headquarters and the Bronx County Courthouse, adding that widespread media coverage had tainted prospective jurors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the surprise of everyone, including the defense lawyers, an appeals court agreed yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its decision, the court concluded, &quot;This case has been deluged by a tidal wave of prejudicial publicity to such an extent that even an attempt to select an unbiased jury would be fruitless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to move the trial to Albany was unusual enough; similar requests, even in high-profile cases, routinely are denied, legal experts said. But the decision was rarer still for its timing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most cases, judges act on a change-of-venue request only after lawyers have tried to pick an impartial jury. In the Diallo trial, the appeals court moved the trial a month before jury selection was due to begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been other cases, most notably the Abner Louima police torture trial, where change-of-venue requests have been denied despite similar publicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the majority of cases, judges refuse to move cases, regardless of negative publicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is definitely good news for the officers on trial,&quot; said Stephen Gillers, a New York University law professor who noted that an Albany jury is likely to differ greatly from a Bronx jury. &quot;When you talk about the Bronx, it really is unique. Albany County brings in a lot of farmland along with the city. I think a community has a legitimate interest in seeing justice served in the same community.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALBANY - This sleepy upstate capital began bracing yesterday for its biggest trial ever, worried about police overtime, the specter of protesting throngs - and the effect of race on the outcome of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others wondered: What case?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what that is,&quot; the mayor's secretary said after a reporter asked to speak to her boss about the Diallo trial. &quot;Will he know what it's about?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll do what we have to do,&quot; Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings said. &quot;All I know is I'm sure I'll incur some overtime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the four-story courthouse, which installed its first metal detector last year, trials often are conducted without a single black juror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change of venue in the racially charged trial worries Alie Kamara, a 45-year-old native of Sierra Leone who heads the African Community of the Capital District, an organization of immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the incident that resulted in four white cops being charged with murder is so stark, Kamara said, jurors - whether black or white - will be able to rule fairly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The further north you come, you will have decisions favored toward police,&quot; said Kamara, of Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But these are not [the juror's] cops - it's cops from a city that does not earn much respect anywhere upstate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albany County prosecutor Cheryl Coleman, who is scheduled to argue two of her own murder trials next month, had a different concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You hope there'll be enough jurors to go around,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also said she was worried that an anti-cop atmosphere would poison jury pools against police who may testify at unrelated trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not pleased,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the state capital, Albany is no stranger to protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the thought of an influx of visitors' cars to the parking-starved cobblestone streets near the downtown courthouse brought fear to commuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As long as they're taking a bus, we'll be fine,&quot; Steve Lisauskas said as he wandered near the courthouse. &quot;If they all drive, we're in trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> block, the calls for justice rang out as loudly yesterday as on the wintry day after he died in a hail of 41 police bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outraged neighbors denounced the decision to move the trial to Albany, calling it a bald-faced effort to spare the four accused cops from the wrath of a Bronx jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They shot him here, they need to be prosecuted here,&quot; Jason Johnson said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ednie Rodriguez cracked open the front door of her brick rowhouse across from Diallo's old building - and lashed out at the judges. &quot;Why in Albany?&quot; she asked. &quot;Do they think it'll start a riot in the Bronx? What do they think? People in the Bronx are more close-minded?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warehouse worker Lou Guzman also said the cops should face Bronx justice. &quot;They will get a lesser sentence upstate,&quot; said Guzman, 25. &quot;They will. You just know it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the vestibule of Diallo's building at 1157 Wheeler Ave., dozens of makeshift messages paid homage to the unarmed African street vendor, who was shot to death on his doorstep Feb. 4, struck by 19 of the 41 bullets the cops fired. &quot;Your life was not in vain,&quot; read one pencil-scrawled note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of the decision spread quickly as residents trudged home from the subway or pulled up in cars to the working-class block in Soundview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many said the decision placed a lesser value on Diallo's life because he lived in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They shot someone 41 times,&quot; said Teresa McKay. &quot;Regardless of where they shot him, they should get time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar Jackson, 25, said the courts were bending over backward solely because the defendants are police officers. &quot;Do most of us get a fair trial?&quot; Jackson asked. &quot;It means nothing. They're guilty as sin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, the near-unanimous belief of Diallo's neighbors that the cops are guilty may have been exactly the type of prejudging of defendants the judges were trying to avoid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaime Hughes, 29, conceded he was unsure the cops could get a fair trial. &quot;I'm pretty sure there are impartial people here,&quot; Hughes said. &quot;But it's more or less the whole circus environment that they're trying to avoid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kathleen Hughes, 64, a relative of Jaime, spoke for most on the block. &quot;If it happened here, it should be [tried] here,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surprise decision locks millions of city residents out of the jury box as the four cops accused of killing Diallo in a hail of 41 bullets are tried in the overwhelmingly white upstate capital region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's outrageous, that's the only way I can say it,&quot; said Kadiadou Diallo, the slain man's mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judges sided with lawyers for the four police officers, who argued that a firestorm of news coverage has made it impossible for them to get a fair trial in any of the five boroughs. The 11-page decision cited newspaper articles and cartoons that lambasted the cops who hit the unarmed African immigrant with 19 bullets Feb. 4. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case has been deluged by a tidal wave of prejudicial publicity,&quot; the five judges wrote. &quot;Even an attempt to select an unbiased jury would be fruitless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton Roberts, the lawyer for Officer Richard Murphy, said he was &quot;delighted&quot; by the decision - which came on what other attorneys had described as a longshot legal motion that rarely succeeds. &quot;If there is ever a case that warrants a change of venue, this is it,&quot; Roberts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops had been expected to opt for a nonjury trial, in which a judge would decide their fate. Now, attorneys say, they expect to have a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an opportunity for the four officers to have a trial that's judged on the facts, not the politics,&quot; said Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. The other Street Crime Unit cops accused in the case are Edward McMellon, Sean Carroll and Kenneth Boss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Giuliani lauded the judges' decision to pull the trial out of the Bronx amid a wave of anti-police sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They noted the things I've been saying throughout,&quot; Giuliani said. &quot;A very, very strong prejudicial, biased, and bigoted viewpoint was being expressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the decision drew nothing but scorn from city activists, black elected officials and residents of Diallo's old block in working-class Soundview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a reminder of the visceral emotional punch of the Diallo case, the Rev. Al Sharpton said the decision reminded him of the Rodney King police beating trial, which was moved to the predominantly white suburbs of Simi Valley, Calif., from Los Angeles. The cops were acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the Simi Valley strategy,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;It undercuts people's confidence in the judicial system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawyer for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Diallo's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> father, Saikou, called the decision &quot;shocking ... This is where he lived, this is where he was shot,&quot; said the lawyer, Omar Mohammedi. &quot;It's outrageous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo supporters were not alone in blasting the decision, in which the judges suggested that 12 impartial jurors could not be found in a city of roughly 8 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson, whose office still will prosecute the case, was upset that the judges ruled before any effort was made to pick a Bronx jury. &quot;Crimes should be tried in the community where they occurred,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;I believe a fair jury could have been empaneled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order, which cannot be appealed, also means that Judge Patricia Williams will be removed from the case, because, as an acting judge, she cannot serve in another county. A new judge will have to be selected in Albany, pushing back the trial indefinitely from its scheduled Jan. 3 start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo supporters attacked the judges for citing poll figures asserting that 81% of Bronx residents say there was no excuse for what the cops did to Diallo. &quot;If we were to use a system run by polls, then nobody would go to trial,&quot; Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the hardships of attending a trial in Albany, 150 miles north of the Bronx, activists vowed to attend every minute. &quot;We're used to the impossible,&quot; said the Rev. Herbert Daughtry.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appellate court yesterday ordered the trial of the four officers charged with murdering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be moved to Albany County, ruling that &quot;the public clamor&quot; over the case made a fair trial in the Bronx impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a written decision, the five-member panel of the Supreme Court Appellate Division ruled that &quot;this case cannot be tried in Bronx County, or anywhere else in the city of New York, without an atmosphere in which jurors would be under enormous pressure to reach the verdict demanded by public opinion.&quot; The trial had been set for Jan. 3, but will now almost certainly be postponed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Feb. 4 shooting of Mr. Diallo, who was unarmed, in a barrage of 41 bullets outside his apartment in the Soundview section of the Bronx led to mass demonstrations against the police, including huge rallies outside police headquarters in which celebrities and well-known New Yorkers were among more than 1,000 people arrested. To many, the killing was proof that the police overreact harshly with minorities -- Mr. Diallo was black, and the officers who shot him are white. The events have been the subject of intense news coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court decision, which cannot be appealed, noted that moving a trial in a major case is &quot;an extraordinary remedy reserved for the rarest of cases,&quot; but added that the shooting of Mr. Diallo &quot;is that rare case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellate court ruled, &quot;We conclude that this case has been deluged by a tidal wave of prejudicial publicity to such an extent that even an attempt to select an unbiased jury would be fruitless.&quot; It cited several news accounts, including a cover of The New Yorker that showed a smiling police officer shooting at a cutout target in human shape with the words &quot;41 shots, 10 cents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court's ruling was immediately denounced by prosecutors and by Mr. Diallo's family. &quot;I could not disagree more strongly with the court's decision,&quot; the Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, said in a statement. &quot;What makes this decision particularly disturbing is that absolutely no effort was invested to even attempt to empanel a fair and impartial Bronx jury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani reacted to the decision with a vigorous defense of the police force, which he has often said has been unfairly judged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rhetoric made it appear as if they were absolutely guilty and there's no question about it,&quot; said Mr. Giuliani, who as a United States attorney prosecuted Stanley Friedman, the Bronx Democratic leader whose 1986 trial involving corruption in the city Parking Violations Bureau was moved to New Haven. &quot;Whether that's true or not, you're entitled to a fair trial, and I think the judges said, 'We're going to treat police officers the way we treat all other human beings. They're entitled to a fair trial also.' I think a number of people do not treat police officers as human beings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Diallo's parents expressed dismay over the appellate court decision. &quot;We waited all this time for justice,&quot; Saikou Amad Diallo, the victim's father, said at a news conference at the National Action Network, the Harlem headquarters of the Rev. Al Sharpton, an adviser to the family. &quot;It will be harmful to me and my family to travel to this place where we've never been.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadiadou Diallo, the victim'smother, who said she was weak from observing the Muslim holiday of Ramadan, was also upset by the decision. &quot;We don't want our agony to be prolonged. We want justice. This is not fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, Patrick Lynch, hailed the decision, calling it &quot;an opportunity for these four officers to have a trial that is judged on the facts, not the politics or other folks' political agendas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Howard Safir said, &quot;The court decision speaks for itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four officers -- Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss, Richard Murphy and Edward McMellon -- are each facing two counts of second-degree murder and one count of reckless endangerment. In a motion filed last month, their lawyers argued that the amount of publicity and the demonstrations had irrevocably tainted the jury pool in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also cited the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; that police officers cannot get a fair trial in Bronx County, which is mostly black and Hispanic. Since at least 1991, every officer facing felony charges related to excessive force while on duty in the Bronx has asked for his case to be heard by a judge, rather than a jury. The decision did not mention the option for a bench trial by a judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The constitutional guarantee of the option of a jury trial is effectively precluded to these defendants,&quot; said the motion, which was written by Bennett M. Epstein, a lawyer for Officer Carroll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers' lawyers had suggested they were leaning toward asking for a trial by a judge in the Bronx. In Albany County, however, they are likely to go before a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution had said the defense had taken news coverage out of context, omitting some that was favorable to the officers. It said the notion that officers could not get a fair trial in the Bronx was &quot;unfounded and unsupported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the court agreed that the &quot;incessant drumbeat&quot; of publicity was likely to influence jurors. It cited three examples that showed the tenor of the coverage: The New Yorker cover, a New York Post column that repeated the word &quot;bang&quot; 41 times, and an advertisement by the American Civil Liberties Union that displayed 41 bullet holes along with the Miranda warning, which begins, &quot;You have the right to remain silent.&quot; The advertisement goes on to read, &quot;On Feb. 4, 1999, the N.Y.P.D. gave </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the right to remain silent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five judges, all of whom were appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki, said they had decided to move the trial to Albany because it is an urban county and is not home to large numbers of New York City law enforcement officers. After surveying census data on several counties with &quot;a reasonable degree of ethnic diversity,&quot; the court selected Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal census figures from 1998 show that Albany's nearly 300,000 residents are 85.8 percent white, 9.2 percent black, 2.7 percent Asian and 2.3 percent Hispanic. The Bronx's 1.19 million people are 48.3 percent Hispanic, 29.4 percent black, 18.6 percent white and 3.7 percent Asian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense lawyers were &quot;dumbstruck,&quot; one said, by yesterday's decision to move the trial, and also delighted. &quot;It is a big victory, a big victory,&quot; said Steven Brounstein, the lawyer for Officer Boss. &quot;Now, hopefully, we'll get a fair trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers said they would now be inclined to have the case heard by a jury instead of solely by a judge.  &quot;We are not committed to anything, but more likely than not we will be going with a jury,&quot; John Patten, who also represents Officer Carroll, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers were uniformly described as pleased by the news that the trial would go to Albany. Mr. Patten, however, noted that Mr. Carroll was dealing with the news that his father had suffered a stroke yesterday morning in Long Island and had to be hospitalized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen C. Worth, the lawyer for Officer McMellon, said that his client &quot;was as surprised and pleased as we were that the Appellate Division had responded to our argument.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But James J. Culleton, the lawyer for Officer Murphy, said the officers had been damaged from the publicity in a way that the change of the trial's location could not fix. &quot;The severity of this indictment stemmed directly from the pretrial publicity,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sharpton, who led the demonstrations in which former Mayor David N. Dinkins and the actress Susan Sarandon were among those arrested, called the decision outrageous and unprecedented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're a police officer in the Bronx, how come you can't be tried in the Bronx, where you have arrested people and had them tried?&quot; Mr. Sharpton asked, adding, &quot;They cannot disenfranchise a whole county.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He vowed, &quot;If this trial is in Alaska, we'll be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its decision, the court singled out the wave of demonstrations that Mr. Sharpton had led, and which he promised would be repeated outside the courthouse once the trial got under way, as a factor that had created a prejudicial climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the Office of Court Administration, said it was unclear when the trial would start. The state must pick a judge in Albany County to hear the case, and the lawyers may request time to find a place to live and work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case until now had been presided over by Justice Patricia Anne Williams of State Supreme Court in the Bronx, but because she is an acting justice, she cannot under state law follow the case to another county. Justice Williams, who previously had denied the defendants' motion for a change of location, declined to comment yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Albany yesterday, residents disagreed over whether the police officers would get a fair hearing in their county. Many said they had followed the case in the news and talked about it with their friends and relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pierre Patrick, 25, a student at SUNY Albany who is black, said the officers would have a better chance with an Albany jury than one in the Bronx. &quot;This is away from the media coverage down there,&quot; he said. &quot;The air is a little different up here. I think people can be more impartial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Nidey, 52, an occupational therapy assistant who is white, said he also thought the police would receive more sympathy in Albany. &quot;This is much more politically conservative than in the city,&quot; he said. &quot;I think they'll get a jury more willing to accept the police story no matter how it turns out.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following are excerpts from a state appeals court ruling granting a request by the four police officers accused in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to change the location of their trial to Albany from the Bronx.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We conclude that this case has been deluged by a tidal wave of prejudicial publicity to such an extent that even an attempt to select an unbiased jury would be fruitless. The prospective jurors of Bronx County, and the rest of New York City, have been subjected to an endless repetition of the notion that the two undisputed facts, namely that 41 shots were fired and that Mr. Diallo was unarmed, conclusively establish defendants' guilt and are dispositive of all possible factual and legal issues. This idea has been repeatedly stated in the form of quotations from prominent persons, or as editorial comment by publications and their columnists. This opinion as to defendants' guilt is routinely accompanied by assertions that defendants were motivated by racial prejudice. The few voices reminding the pool of prospective jurors of the sacrosanct right of an accused to the presumption of innocence have been drowned out by this incessant drumbeat of prejudicial publicity. . . . </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is not a simple matter of asking the jurors if they could put aside any opinions that may have formed. Instead, it would also be necessary to ascertain whether they could face their friends and neighbors in the event of an acquittal. The very asking of such questions carries the danger of implanting or reinforcing in the jurors' minds the fear of the consequences of reaching an unpopular verdict. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We do not diminish the tragedy of Mr. Diallo's death by insisting that criminal liability for his death must be determined by a fair and impartial trial. A trial in which the jurors have been persuaded in advance, by outside influences, that they have a duty to reach a certain verdict is not a trial; it is no different from the staged proceedings of totalitarian societies where there is the illusion of a fair trial but the predetermined outcome follows a script. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie H. Hughes stood outside his building on Wheeler Avenue yesterday, across the street from where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was shot at 41 times, and said words that were echoing throughout his neighborhood. Yes, he said, he had heard that the four police officers who opened fire on Mr. Diallo would be tried in Albany, and not in the Bronx. And yes, he said, he was angry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not fair,&quot; Mr. Hughes said, standing near his car in the cold evening, hands wedged deep into the pockets of his leather jacket. &quot;If justice is what we are seeking, and if justice is working, then I think everybody should be treated equally. A normal person who gets arrested in the Bronx would not get a trial outside the Bronx. So why should they?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Hughes, 29, a building superintendent, might as well have been speaking for most of his neighbors in Soundview, where bewilderment and disappointment greeted the news that a state appellate court had ordered the police officers' murder trial to be moved upstate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellate panel said the change of venue would ensure that the officers would receive a fair trial, and that jurors would be less likely to be influenced by the intense pretrial publicity. But among residents of Wheeler Avenue, and passers-by on the streets nearby, the feeling was much different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One by one, they recalled details: Mr. Diallo, a street vendor with no criminal record, was struck by 19 of the 41 police bullets. He was unarmed. He died on his own doorstep, where the bullet holes still pockmark the hallway, and the door's wooden frame shows splinters where the lead passed through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of this happened in the Bronx, they said, and that's where the trial belongs: where concerned residents could attend the trial, and where local jurors could hear the facts, one by one, as the case unfolds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People feel strong about everything that happened,&quot; said Omar D. Jackson, 25, a cable wireman who lives two doors from where the shooting occurred. &quot;Once they move the trial out of the Bronx, I think some slack will be cut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few houses farther up the street, Allison Boodram, 18, stood on her doorstep with her 5-year-old sister, Vada, and said she was disappointed. She knew Mr. Diallo, and had been eager to see the police officers in the courtroom, and to hear an explanation -- any explanation -- for why so many shots were fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was hoping that when it started in January, that I would be able to go to the courthouse,&quot; Ms. Boodram said. &quot;But Albany? Who can go there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up and down the street, Mr. Diallo's friends and neighbors had questions, some for the appellate panel, some for the police officers. Did the judges think the people of the Bronx could not be fair? Would the jury in Albany be racially diverse? Would the prosecutors be aggressive if they were far from the scene, working in a climate with less political tension?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there was the ultimate question, the one that almost everybody had. Lou Guzman, 25, a Rite-Aid stock clerk who lives on Wheeler Avenue, put it simply: &quot;I would like to know, I would like to hear it myself: Why did it take 41 shots?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he framed another: &quot;Did they honestly think they could get away with it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he spoke, a police cruiser eased down the street, and the officers inside fixed their views stonily ahead. They did not stop, avoiding contact with the reporters and the residents who had taken up station on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But later, after the cold had chased most of the residents inside and the reporters away, a few police officers offered their opinions. To them, the intense feelings on Wheeler Avenue underscored the soundness of the judges' decision. The depth of the divide between the police and the residents of the Bronx is too great, they said, for a case like this. &quot;If that was me on trial, and I had a choice, I'd rather be out of the borough,&quot; one officer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another officer, standing on Westchester Avenue, less than a block from where Mr. Diallo died, said the move to Albany was the four officers' best chance for a fair hearing. Whatever the facts of the case, and the tactics of the officers' defense, the people of the Bronx, he said, would hear nothing of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is known throughout the department that you can't get a fair trial here,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to get a change of venue or a judge trial. Either that, or you go to jail -- and then you close the cell door behind you.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For police officers facing brutality charges, moving a trial to a new location can mean the difference between conviction and acquittal, legal experts say. There is no more powerful example than the case of the Los Angeles police officers who beat Rodney G. King, a black man, in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the incident occurred in Los Angeles, lawyers for the four officers, citing pretrial publicity, persuaded a judge to move the trial to Simi Valley, a largely white area in neighboring Ventura County. The officers were acquitted in 1992 by a jury that had no black members, leading to rioting that roiled Los Angeles for days. In 1993, the officers were tried on federal civil rights charges. Two were convicted and two were acquitted by a 12-person Los Angeles jury that included two African-Americans and one Latino. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pretrial publicity was the main reason cited yesterday by a New York appeals court for moving to Albany the trial of four New York City police officers accused of killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Feb. 4 as he stood near the entrance of his apartment building in the Bronx. Comparisons between Simi Valley and largely white Albany seem unavoidable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Requests by defense lawyers to move cases are not unusual, but courts rarely grant the requests; yesterday, the appeals court called the move &quot;an extraordinary remedy reserved for the rarest of cases.&quot; Lawyers usually argue that the move is necessary because pretrial publicity has tainted the local jury pool, but judges often rule that such fears are exaggerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for John Wayne Gacy, who was convicted of murdering 33 boys and young men in the Chicago area two decades ago, argued for moving the trial, known legally as a change of venue, because of publicity, but Judge Louis B. Garippo of the Cook County Circuit Court rejected that argument. He did, however, order that a jury be selected in another county and brought to Chicago, because of the large number of victims and the likelihood that potential jurors in Chicago would have known them or their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A handful of high profile cases in the New York area have been moved in recent years because of concerns over pretrial publicity, including the 1986 federal trial of Stanley Friedman, the Bronx Democratic leader, involving corruption in the New York City Parking Violations Bureau. That trial was moved to New Haven, Conn., after an agreement between defense lawyers and Rudolph W. Giuliani, then a United States attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Mayor Giuliani said, &quot;You should basically resolve these things in favor of the defendant's getting every opportunity to have a fair trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early 1980's, trials for a number of defendants accused in an armored car robbery in Rockland County that left three dead were moved to Orange County and to White Plains because of publicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only in rare instances, like the case in Los Angeles, is there perceived to be a deeply felt public sentiment against the defendants. And some legal experts believe that public sentiment about a defendant or a particular crime should not necessarily disqualify a community from meting out justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Defendants are using these venue motions as a way of avoiding the evaluation of their conduct by the community where the crime was committed,&quot; said Drew L. Kershen, a law professor at the University of Oklahoma. The trial of Timothy McVeigh on murder charges stemming from the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City was a case in point, Professor Kershen said. It was moved to Denver largely because of the presumed prejudice of the people of Oklahoma City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a lot of confidence that people in the districts affected can make these decisions, and they're the ones who ought to,&quot; he said. The Simi Valley jurors, he said, had no stake in what happened in Los Angeles. &quot;The defendant should not have to face a howling mob, but until you prove that to me, I don't think you ought to let defendants get away from facing possible condemnation. It's not about letting defendants pick a place where they can win,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moving of trials far from the location of a crime surfaced as an issue in American law during colonial times, when people accused of crimes were often transported to England for trials. Colonists objected, saying local juries were in a better position to evaluate their actions than juries in London. That sentiment was written as a defendant's right into the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees &quot;a public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Albany, the New York officers are likely to find a more sympathetic jury pool. &quot;I don't think I could pick a better spot than Albany to present a case like that,&quot; said Terence L. Klindon, a trial lawyer in Albany. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

Mr. Bradley and Mr. McCain signed a pledge stating that if both won their parties' nominations, they would not allow their parties to spend the unlimited donations to political parties known as soft money on their general election campaigns. They also took some sharp shots at each other's front-running opponents for president.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A1<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Clinton Faults Pentagon<BR>President Clinton said that the way the military was using the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy on gays in uniform could pit soldier against soldier and he said he would seek changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A28<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Lewinsky Testifies About Tapes<BR>Monica S.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last spring, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said of the four cops charged with murder in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, &quot;I pray they get a fair trial.&quot; It's still not certain that this will happen, but yesterday's Appellate Division decision moving the trial to Albany is a critical first step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It goes without saying that the four officers charged in this case face an uphill legal battle. The tragic shooting of Diallo has been exploited for political gain by Mayor Giuliani's foes from the outset -- indeed, Al Sharpton has claimed, not without justification, that his mass-arrest campaign was responsible for the murder indictments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lost in all the public hoopla, however, has been the presumption of innocence that rightfully belongs to all defendants in a criminal case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was indeed the point made crystal clear by the appeals judges, who condemned the &quot;incessant drumbeat of pretrial publicity&quot; which declared that the shooting of Diallo was &quot;motivated by racial prejudice.&quot; They not only moved the trial, but ordered that it be heard by an Albany judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added the judges: &quot;This case has been del-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">uged by a tidal wave of prejudicial publicity to such an extent that even an attempt to select an unbiased jury would be fruitless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judges clearly were persuaded by defense lawyer Burton Roberts, former chief judge of The Bronx, who cited the sad situation that we have been decrying for years: Juries in that borough are notoriously biased against police officers and sympathetic to cop-killers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Sharpton is livid over the decision, ridiculously comparing it to the trial of the cops involved in the Rodney King case -- which should give some indication of how sound a ruling it actually is. Now, at least, the case will turn not on demagoguery but on the actual point of law: Did the cops, as we're inclined to believe, lawfully use deadly force the night Diallo died?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Appellate Division decided that this case would best be heard away from the harsh political and media glare -- in short, to be tried in the courtroom, not on local TV news. The judges are right -- and at least now there's a possibility that the legal system may actually be able to work as intended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A panel of judges has unanimously moved the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> murder trial to Albany -- agreeing with police defense lawyers that it would be impossible to pick an impartial jury in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision means the four white officers -- who fired 41 times at the unarmed West African immigrant Feb. 4 -- will be tried three hours north of the city that erupted in outrage over the shooting's perceived police brutality and racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling cannot be appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hailed by the officers but decried by Bronx prosecutors and Diallo's family, the decision also means a delay in the original Jan. 3 trial date while a new judge is picked and brought up to speed on the complicated case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the country, even high-publicity trials are rarely moved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the panel of five Appellate Division judges wrote in its 11-page decision that moving the Diallo trial is the only way to escape the &quot;incessant drumbeat of prejudicial publicity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel reversed an earlier decision by Bronx Supreme Court Justice Patricia Ann Williams to keep the case in her courtroom. Williams declined comment yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We conclude that this case has been deluged by a tidal wave of prejudicial publicity to such an extent that an attempt to select an unbiased [New York City] jury would be fruitless,&quot; the panel wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;tidal wave&quot; cited included over 1,000 protester arrests, widespread demonstrations, an ACLU newspaper ad picturing 41 bullet holes, a New Yorker magazine cover with a smiling police officer in a shooting gallery with human-shaped targets, and a New York Post column that included a paragraph consisting of the word &quot;Bang,&quot; repeated 41 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson blasted the ruling, saying it &quot;reflects a lack of trust in the jury selection process in general and of Bronx jurors in particular.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadiatou and Saikou Diallo -- the mother and father of the slain 22-year-old street peddler, and who came to New York from Guinea for the original trial date -- were anguished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why? Why?&quot; Saikou Diallo said. &quot;This is going to be very difficult for us. I don't understand how this could have happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want our agony prolonged,&quot; said Kadiatou Diallo. &quot;We respect the rules, but we ask the DA to appeal this ... It's outrageous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers -- Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy -- said through their lawyers they were elated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers have argued that the cops mistakenly believed Diallo was reaching for a gun, and that the shooting is a tragedy -- but not a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boss' lawyer, Steven Brounstein, said: &quot;My guy's going to testify. He's going to tell me, and tell you and tell Mrs. Diallo what happened -- and now a fair jury is going to realize that this was just a tragic error.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carroll's lawyer, Burton Roberts, said the decision means all four cops will have &quot;a fair trial, based on the facts, not on politics or political agendas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMellon's lawyer, Stephen Worth, said: &quot;We're very happy that the courts realized this case could not be tried fairly in New York City.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murphy's lawyer, James Culleton, said: &quot;We're not looking for an advantage. We're looking for a fair jury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its decision, the appellate panel said prospective jurors citywide have been subjected through the media to &quot;endless repetition&quot; of the February shooting's two undisputed facts &quot;that 41 shots were filed and that Mr. Diallo was unarmed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expected protests would put jurors under &quot;enormous pressure to reach the verdict demanded by the public,&quot; they wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, a Diallo family adviser, said he'll hold a 9 a.m. protest outside the Bronx County courthouse today -- and will ask the state attorney general and federal officials to look at the ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This decision is an insult to the people of The Bronx. It is demeaning. It is biased and, we believe, illegal,&quot; Sharpton fumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we have to go to Alaska [for the trial], we will be there,&quot; he vowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Giuliani praised the ruling, saying, &quot;Judges exist to vindicate everyone's constitutional rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others politicians, including Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, blasted the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Bronx County courthouse, jurors on other criminal trials insisted a Bronx jury could be neutral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you have an open mind and go by the evidence, it's a fair trial,&quot; a 27-year-old man said. &quot;But the evidence says it all.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers defending four NYPD cops charged with murdering African peddler </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> scored a huge victory by getting the powder-keg trial moved upstate, legal experts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By getting the proceedings moved to Albany County, the cops' legal team will be picking jurors from a mostly white, conservative, law-and-order population -- a very different demographic from the mostly black and Hispanic Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Albany is very conservative and pro-police,&quot; said Terry Kindlon, an Albany lawyer. &quot;A police officer charged with a crime couldn't pick a better county.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albany County is 88 percent white and only 9 percent black, while The Bronx is 19 percent white, 42 percent black and 48 percent Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond mere numbers, experts said Bronx jurors would be much less likely to sympathize with the cops' defense that they opened fire on the unarmed peddler because of fear -- rather than police brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jurors in The Bronx are more likely to have been victims of overaggressive policing,&quot; said lawyer David Feige. &quot;The population in Albany is less likely to have first-hand experience with inappropriate police tactics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the change of venue, the Diallo case resembles the case of four Los Angeles cops involved in the beating of Rodney King. The trial was moved from urban Los Angeles to the mostly white suburb Simi Valley -- and all four officers were acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Albany is just like Simi Valley when it comes to cops,&quot; said lawyer Susan Karten, who represented the family of chokehold victim Anthony Baez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, an all-white jury acquitted two Albany cops of beating a handcuffed black suspect -- despite eyewitness testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The jurors saw everything from the cops' perspectives,&quot; said Kindlon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A change of venue should not affect the case because jurors are instructed to eliminate any personal biases. But experts say that objectivity is impossible because jurors are, after all, human.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The life experiences of a juror in Albany are very different from those of a juror in The Bronx,&quot; said Jeff Kern, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE were 1,500 cops under one roof, and some of their faces showed what years of battling the armies of the night was all about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news that the Diallo case had been moved to Albany rippled through the El Caribe catering hall in Brooklyn -- and the collective sigh of relief was almost deafening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retired Sgt. Mo Howard, a 23-year veteran and hero of the fight against evil, quietly sipped a beer and said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I live in The Bronx, I've worked in The Bronx. I'm retired now, but I still carry a gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would help anyone if I could but, frankly, I'd rather use that gun on myself than face a Bronx jury. I've always been on the thin line, and I'd rather go out with honor than have to face what that jury would do to a cop. And this is the place and the people who I love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strong and emotional words about a situation that, tragically, we know to be true -- get a cop in the box in The Bronx and his ass is grass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, the 1,500 represented current and retired officers of the Sergeants Benevolent Association who met to mark a changing of the guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veteran Bronx cop Bernie Pound had just picked up the gavel from Joe Toal, a veteran of 40 years in police work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new president, Bernie Pound, said, &quot;We are happy they are moving the trial but we were confident that the accused would have been cleared in any jurisdiction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outgoing president Toal, who has been around the block more than a few times, said: &quot;There are no sergeants involved in this tragedy, but everyone of us has been on that street, those streets, and I can tell you in the past decade the borough of The Bronx has been the toughest job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Cerrone, the SBA lawyer, said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We, like all police officers, have the ultimate confidence in the people of The Bronx, but we do not share that same confidence in the criminal justice system of The Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I cannot tell you how many cases I've covered in The Bronx with District Attorney Robert Johnson being the ramrod of what passes for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's brilliant legal move was engineered by lawyers Burton Roberts, Bennett Epstein and John Patten, who are representing officer Sean Carroll in the tragedy surrounding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the work of Burton Roberts and Bennett Epstein,&quot; said Patten, who has a staggering record of giving wrongly accused cops the chance to walk free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were concerned about getting a fair trial. An independent poll taken in November showed that 81 percent of the people questioned said the shooting was unjustified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then The New York Times ran a highly prejudicial advertisement underwritten by the Civil Liberties Union that clearly made a fair trial a farce. In many ways they may have done us a favor so that we can present a fair case to clear these young officers in what was a tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I cannot be a hypocrite. I have little respect for Johnson as a district attorney and I know that this news will be a messy blow to his ego.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a man who defies guidelines to seek the death penalty when a cop is gunned down in cold blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's going to be a tough night, Mr. District Attorney -- I suggest you lock up all sharp instruments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial in N.Y. immigrant's death moved to Albany</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial of four New York City police officers accused of murdering West African immigrant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a hail of 41 bullets was relocated yesterday from the Bronx to Albany by a state appeals court because of pretrial media coverage. Diallo, struck 19 times, was dead at the scene. The police officers said they were searching for a rape suspect and mistakenly believed the street vendor was reaching for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson pleads not guilty in Ill. protest case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Jesse Jackson pleaded not guilty yesterday to trespassing and contributing to the delinquency of a minor related to his protest on behalf of six students expelled from an Illinois high school a month ago. A more serious charge of mob action against Jackson was dropped, but Jackson indicated outside Macon County Court in central Illinois that he would fight the remaining charges. Jackson unsuccessfully sought to get six students reenrolled in a Decatur school after they were expelled for a brawl at a September football game. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talks go on in Louisiana jail uprising</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jail uprising in St. Martinville, La., entered its fourth day yesterday as the FBI negotiated delicately with Cubans holding the warden and two deputies at knifepoint. The hostages are shackled but sitting in chairs and were otherwise unharmed, said a sheriff's office spokeswoman. The Cubans have completed their sentences and although the United States would like to deport them, it cannot because there is no deportation agreement with Cuba, officials said. Cuba has refused to accept them. They have said they will go anywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission limits height of King memorial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A memorial to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., halfway between the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials in Washington, must rise no more than 20 feet, the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts said yesterday. The site is near where Dr. King gave his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech in 1963. The monument will sit on the shore of the Tidal Basin, a pool formed by the nearby Potomac River, near the new memorial to President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">N.C. Republican had breast cancer removed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Sue Myrick (R., N.C.) revealed yesterday that she underwent breast cancer surgery last week, but said it would not affect her plans to seek a fourth term next year. Myrick, 58, told reporters in Charlotte that doctors detected the cancer at the end of November. The early diagnosis enabled doctors to remove the growth while it remained low-risk and before it had spread, she said. She will return to Washington in January when Congress reconvenes and will not alter her schedule. Myrick, the former mayor of Charlotte, was elected to the House in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the World</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kohl investigated for evidence of bribes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German parliament launched a formal investigation yesterday into former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, attempting to find out if his government accepted bribes. Kohl has said he set up secret bank accounts to finance unspecified campaign activities of his Christian Democratic Union party, but in a TV interview yesterday he staunchly rejected allegations that he had accepted bribes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banker chosen as Romanian prime minister</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romanian President Emil Constantinescu nominated Central Bank governor Mugur Isarescu as prime minister-designate yesterday to replace Radu Vasile, who was fired in a political upheaval this week. Constantinescu said Isarescu's appointment would prove Romania's strong commitment to put the economy back in shape and start negotiations to join the European Union next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans in Jordan warned about security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States warned Americans in Jordan yesterday to be extra careful about their security because the full dimensions of a terrorist threat were not yet known after the arrest of 13 suspects there. Jordan said Wednesday that it believed the 13 were planning to carry out terrorist operations and were connected to alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortened workweek approved by French</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French parliament gave final approval yesterday to legislation for a shortened workweek of 35 hours, which takes effect in 2000. Socialist Premier Lionel Jospin hopes that enterprises will hire more people to do the work of those employees who now will be working fewer hours and thereby reduce unemployment, which is about 11 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family loses court battle for return of art</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A court in the Hague, Netherlands, rejected yesterday a Jewish family's request for restitution of hundreds of paintings stolen by the Nazis during World War II. Descendants in the United States of Amsterdam collector Jacques Goudstikker, who died in the Holocaust, had demanded the paintings' return. The court said that after the war the Goudstikker family had &quot;in a deliberate and well-considered manner relinquished its rights&quot; to the paintings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moldova gets natural-gas supply back on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moldova's natural-gas supply was restored yesterday, one day after Russia cut off deliveries, saying the former Soviet republic owed it $600 million, Moldovan officials said. They said negotiations on the debt were continuing in Moscow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Europeans freed by Sierra Leone rebels</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebels in Sierra Leone freed two European hostages yesterday, ending a weeklong kidnapping saga underlining problems with the country's civil war accord. The two, a German and a Belgian, work for the aid group Doctors Without Borders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 70 members of the International Olympic Committee visited Salt Lake during the bidding for the 2002 Winter Games, according to confidential documents obtained Thursday by the Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IOC banned visits to bid cities as part of a package of reforms adopted last weekend in the wake of the Salt Lake bribery scandal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salt Lake boosters fretted over a particularly &quot;high-expense month&quot;&nbsp;in September 1994, when IOC members and site experts arrived to evaluate the city's bid. Notes from the same confidential meeting warned of a cash shortage that month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 30 students, including 20 minors, were inside a storage shed with a 15.5-gallon keg, and police believed they were drinking, according to an offense report written Nov. 5, 1998.
