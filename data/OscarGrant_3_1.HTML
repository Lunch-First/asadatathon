<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c5"> LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ... The end result is now a general distrust of politicians, law enforcement officers, and attorneys, and an all too real cynicism about governmental affairs.  ... They can range from lying to investigators, alteration and destruction of documents, obstructing governmental proceedings, and giving false statements, among others.  ... Once Governor X is now in office, he now has to honor his campaign promise to reduce property taxes.  ... As a result, the PDC determined that Rickert had violated the false campaign statements statute, and fined her $ 1000.  ... &quot;In a political campaign, a candidate's factual blunder is unlikely to escape the notice of, and correction by, the erring candidate's political opponent.  ... In 119 Vote No , the Washington Supreme Court was confronted with a challenge to the statute prohibiting false political statements regarding a candidate or ballot measure with actual malice.  ... In response, several other states in addition to Washington have laws on their books that would impose sanctions for false campaign speech.  ... Spitzer's dalliances came to the surface as a result of a routine IRS investigation into questionable wire transfers between bank accounts.  ... It may be small consolation in light of his &quot;sexting&quot; misadventures, but I imagine that it will not be long before Weiner experiences a &quot;comeback&quot; similar to Spitzer.  ... &quot;Conversations between suspects and undercover agents do not implicate the concerns underlying Miranda.  ... Burbine , the defendant had been arrested for burglary and was also a suspect in a murder investigation.  ... Instead of contacting the public defender's office, Paulter agreed with the police officers at the scene that he would pose as a public defender that would represent Neal.</SPAN></P>

Unfortunately, human history is littered with innumerable examples of people who have disregarded that rather simple requirement of honesty. Little kids lie (&quot;I didn't break the vase, Mommy!&quot;). Corporate executives lie.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*62]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lawyers lie  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> . Accounting Firms lie.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Politicians lie.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police Officers lie.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even Presidents lie.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*63]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In this piece, I will first look at several sanctions that result from lying to government officials. I will then briefly discuss several infamous incidents involving some well-known individuals who tried lying to the government. Finally, I will look at a few real life examples showing how and why those sanctions are not always applied in the opposite direction. This is especially the case when the perpetrator is a government official who is telling the lie during the regular course of his duties. This includes how the Constitution is implicated so that some governmental employees do not always face legal sanctions for lying on the job. The end result is now a general distrust of politicians, law enforcement officers, and attorneys, and an all too real cynicism about governmental affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">II. WHY LYING IS NOT A GOOD IDEA, AND THE RESULTING PENALTIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are different ways in which a party can attempt to thwart a government investigation. They can range from lying to investigators, alteration and destruction of documents, obstructing governmental proceedings, and giving false statements, among others. Below are a few statutory prohibitions against making intentional misrepresentations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*64]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">A. Perjury</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a person's federal income tax return (Form 1040), there is an affirmation directly above the signature line that says the following:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this return and accompanying schedules and statements, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, they are true, correct, and accurately list all amounts and sources of income I received during the tax year.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal law generally defines perjury as a party giving false statements under oath,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as well as giving written documentation under penalty of perjury to a competent tribunal, officer, or person.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, out of the gate, the Internal Revenue Service (&quot;IRS&quot;) lets taxpayers know in no uncertain terms that they will suffer recrimination if they intentionally include false and misleading information on their tax returns. Upon a perjury conviction, either in general, or on one's tax return, the convicted perjurer &quot;shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">B. False Statements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal law also provides sanctions against ones knowingly making statements that are materially false or misleading.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, unlike perjury, one does not have to be under oath when one makes false statements. It is enough that that one knows of the falsity of an oral or written statement at the time he makes the statement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Upon a conviction for knowingly making false statements, the party &quot;shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than five &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*65]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  years, or if the offense involves international or domestic terrorism, imprisoned not more than eight years, or both.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">C. Destruction of Records</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent memory, one of the most indelible examples of destroying records in an attempt to hide the truth was that of former &quot;Big Five&quot; accounting firm Arthur Andersen (Andersen), which destroyed nearly two tons of documents relating to its audit and non-audit work of its highest profile client, Enron.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andersen was eventually convicted on one count of obstruction of justice.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andersen's conviction was eventually overturned on appeal by the U.S. Supreme Court.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately, however, the collateral damage resulting from Andersen's conviction ultimately drove the company out of business.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal law also has rather stiff sanctions against those individuals that would destroy, or alter, or falsify any and all records connected with a federal investigation:  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*66]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">D. Obstructing Investigations, Civil and Criminal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal law also has strong prohibitions against any party who attempts to impede any civil or criminal investigation. Any party who obstructs a civil investigation, upon conviction, is subject to a fine, or five year prison sentence (or eight years if the investigation is connected with international or domestic terrorism), or both.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, any party who attempts bribery to obstruct a criminal investigation will be subject to a fine, or five years imprisonment, or both.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Additionally, any party who wrongfully discloses information regarding a criminal investigation or grand jury proceeding will also be subject to a fine, or five years imprisonment, or both.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, if a party notifies a customer of a financial institution whose records are being subpoenaed, or notifies any person named in the subpoena that something is coming down the road, that person will be subject to a fine, or one year imprisonment, or both.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are just a few of the ways that a party can suffer legal penalties in any attempt to hide, destroy, or otherwise distort the truth in any attempts to subvert the legal process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">III. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT LIKE IT WHEN SOMEONE LIES TO IT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will briefly discuss a few of a great many people who tried to lie to the government and got caught. As this very brief list includes sports figures, business people, celebrities, and even &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*67]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  presidents, it would tend to support the proposition that no one is above the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">Bill Clinton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can anyone ever forget his grand jury testimony saying &quot;it depends on what the meaning on the word </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c26">is</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is&quot;? The 42nd President of the United States (1993-2001) was hit with two articles of impeachment  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for lying about his extramarital affairs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two counts were for perjury and obstruction of justice.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clinton was then brought to trial before the U.S. Senate  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> , where a 2/3 majority vote  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> favoring conviction would have resulted in his removal from office. However, Clinton was acquitted on the perjury charge by a count of 55-45 (55 for acquittal, 45 for conviction) and was acquitted on the obstruction charge by a 50-50 deadlock. Although Clinton was able to avoid conviction, he still suffered some legal recrimination. His Arkansas law license suspended for five years, was cited for contempt of court, and had to pay a $ 25,000 court fine.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am not making any moral judgments about his politics or his ethics; I am merely stating some well-known facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">B. Richard Nixon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 37th President of the United States (1969-1974) has gone down in history as the ringleader of the Watergate scandal. Watergate refers to the name of a Washington, D.C. hotel where several individuals were arrested attempting to break into the offices of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DNC &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*68]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  offices were located in the Watergate Hotel. As the facts eventually turned out, the break-in had been authorized by Nixon and key members of his inner circle. Pursuant to House Resolution 803, the House Judiciary Committee prepared three Articles of Impeachment which upon conviction would have resulted in Nixon's removal from office (he resigned before being tried in the Senate). Nixon was charged with obstruction of justice, violating the constitutional rights of citizens, and failing to produce documents subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fallout from Watergate resulted in Nixon's resignation from office during his second term, the loss of his law license, and his identification as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Watergate affairs. Love him or hate him, one almost indelible impression of Nixon is as one of history's all time liars. Again, I make no moral judgments about his politics or his ethics; I am again merely stating the facts (exhaustively discussed in other forums). Many point to his (in) famous speech (among other misdeeds) in which he proclaimed himself not to be a &quot;crook&quot; as evidence he was just that:</SPAN></P>

And in all of my years of public life I have never obstructed justice. And I think, too, that I can say that in my years of public life, that I welcome this kind of examination, because people have got to know if their president is a crook. Well, I am not a crook.

From 1999 to 2004, Snipes had earned over thirty seven million dollars of gross income.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he never filed federal tax returns for any of those years.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, he had filed an amended return for calendar year 1997, for which he claimed a refund of over seven million dollars of taxes he erroneously paid,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*71]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and an amended return for calendar year 1996, where he claimed a refund of approximately four million dollars of taxes that he allegedly paid in error.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marion Jones was an Olympic medal winning track star who had won three gold medals and five bronze medals at the 2000 Olympics. Now, she is also known for being an admitted steroid user after having lied about having never used steroids for years, along with her prison sentence for having lied about it. &quot;After long denying that she had ever used performance enhancing drugs, Jones admitted in federal court that she used the designer drug steroid 'the clear' from September 2000 to July 2001.

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are only a few high profile individuals who suffered some stiff sanctions as a result of lying to the government. If we accept the proposition that no one is above the law, do we have a reasonable expectation that government agents will be honest with us? And more importantly would we, the voting public, have any legal recourse against government agents when they lie to us? Unfortunately, not always.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">IV. POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE &quot;MISSTATEMENTS&quot;: ARE GOVERNMENT AGENTS HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS WHEN THEY LIE TO US?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One would hope so. However, this is not always the case. This is especially true in political campaigns. Assume we have candidate X, a current member of the legislature of State Blue, who is running for the governorship of State Blue against incumbent governor/candidate Y. Candidate X's platform centers on the fact that property taxes have tripled during the time Governor Y has been in office. Candidate X promises that if he is elected, the first thing he will do is reduce property taxes. Naturally, the property owners who have been getting killed by high property taxes would most likely vote for Candidate X. As a result, Candidate X wins the election and now becomes the next governor of State Blue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once Governor X is now in office, he now has to honor his campaign promise to reduce property taxes. In balancing State Blue's budget, Governor X realizes that he has to keep things &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*73]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  revenue neutral and at the same time be able to implement his tax cut. What does it mean to be revenue neutral? It means that the governmental body must bring in the same amount of money every year in spite of any changes in the tax laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putting some hypothetical numbers to this, we will assume that last year under the former Governor Y, State Blue amassed six hundred million dollars of property tax revenues when the property tax rate was six percent. This year, the new Governor X's budget includes a 2 percent decrease in property taxes to four percent. This results in State Blue generating four hundred million dollars of property tax revenues this year, a shortfall of two hundred million from last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does Governor X resolve his two hundred million budget gap? Unfortunately, when he ran on his campaign platform of reducing property taxes, he usually did not mention in great detail how he would be able to put his tax cut plan into place. In order for the new governor to balance his budget and have his tax cut, he might need to do some rather distasteful things. Governor X may have to raise the income tax. He may have increase sales taxes. He may have to raise the fees for parking meters and driver's license renewals. On the flip side, Governor X may have to reduce expenses by cutting State Blue's spending. He may need to lay off police officers, firefighters, hospital staff, teachers, librarians, sanitation workers, and so on. Or, Governor X may have to do a little of both: raise taxes and fees along with imposing deep cuts and layoffs. This now puts Governor X's supporters (and everyone else) in the unfortunately ironic position of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">paying more for less</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. If Governor X does in fact honor his campaign promise and reduce property taxes, why would the voting public be disillusioned by him? Because he did not tell the full story about how he was going to reduce property taxes until </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">after</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he won the election. This in turn leaves the voting public with the sense that they have been taken (yet again) by still another politician's bait and switch. The end result is whatever benefits the voting public might have received from the property tax cut is outweighed by whatever they lost in the form of budget cuts and increased taxes and fees elsewhere. Unfortunately, while my little example here is &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*74]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a hypothetical, there are many other examples where a politician's statements were not exactly the whole unvarnished truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">V. THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE POLITICAL LIE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my view, one very important reason why many people (and I include myself here) severely distrust politicians is that politicians routinely distort the record of their opponents. The campaign rhetoric seems to say to the voting public: &quot;Vote for me . . . not so much because I'm so wonderful, but because my opponent is terrible! And here is my opponent's record on the issues, which proves why my opponent is so pitiful!&quot; The accuracy of one candidate's allegation of a political opponent's record really does not make a difference. Thus, as long as Candidate # 1 shows that he is the lesser of two evils compared to Candidate # 2, Candidate # 1 should win the election. And he wouldn't let a little thing like honesty get in the way of winning either. I guess that all is fair in love, war, and politics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the State of Washington, it is perfectly legal for an individual running for public office to lie about a political opponent during a campaign. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">Rickert</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the plaintiff, Marilou Rickert, ran for election to the Washington State Senate against incumbent Tim Sheldon in 2002.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the campaign, Rickert's camp distributed brochures alleging alleging that Sheldon &quot;voted to close a facility for the developmentally challenged in his district.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the time, the State of Washington had a statute  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prohibiting any political candidate from sponsoring, with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">actual malice</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, any political advertising that contained a false statement of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*75]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  material fact about a candidate for public office.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statute, however, did not apply to any candidate who made false statements about himself.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statute defined actual malice as acting &quot;with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to truth or falsity.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Actual malice is the standard that the U.S. Supreme Court established whenever the plaintiff in a defamation lawsuit is in fact a public figure.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to Rickert's allegation, Sheldon lodged a complaint with the state's Public Disclosure Commission (PDC).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PDC was the administrative agency responsible for investtigating and redressing allegations of false political statements.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PDC held a hearing to determine the truthfulness of Rickert's statements and determined that two of the statements were indeed false.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PDC determined that Rickert's allegation that Sheldon voted to close a facility for the developmentally challenged was false, and that Rickert's statement that the facility in question was for the developmentally challenged was also false.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, the PDC determined that Rickert had violated the false campaign statements statute, and fined her $ 1000.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rickert appealed her conviction all the way up to the Washington Supreme Court.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declared the statute unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds. The majority took the position that the government itself cannot be &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*76]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the sole arbiter to determine the truth in any political discourse, that the government cannot substitute its own judgment for that of speakers and listeners, and that the statute constitutes impermissible governmental censorship.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The majority also noted that any political misstatements or distortions of a candidate's record is best addressed by the candidate himself. &quot;In a political campaign, a candidate's factual blunder is unlikely to escape the notice of, and correction by, the erring candidate's political opponent. The preferred First Amendment remedy of 'more speech, not enforced silence' thus has special force.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Additionally, the majority noted that if Senator Sheldon had suffered an injury to his reputation due to Rickert's false statements, he had the remedy of pursuing a defamation lawsuit.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, the majority noted that the voting public was astute enough on its own not to believe Rickert's assertions, as Sheldon was reelected in a landslide with 79% of the popular vote.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dissenting justices disagreed, and quite vehemently at that. Particularly Justice Madsen, as one might expect. Justice Madsen states quite unequivocally that the court's ruling now gives any Washington (state) politician an open license to lie. &quot;Unfortunately, the majority's decision is an invitation to lie with impunity.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, one just cannot have confidence in the integrity of the political process if candidates for political office can tell a deliberate, premeditated falsehood and get away with it. &quot;Neither the intentional lie nor the careless error materially advances society's interest in 'uninhibited, robust, and wide-open' debate on public issues.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I admit that I agree with Justice Madsen on the outcome of this case. In my opinion, most people happen to have an almost ingrained distrust of the political process and of politicians. I &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*77]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  believe that most people do not believe that people go into politics to serve their public constituencies, no matter what they say on the record. I believe that most people who go into &quot;public service&quot; do so with ulterior motives like getting money, power, prestige, advancing their careers, and the like. &quot;The fact is, many of the policy makers and interest groups that populate American politics are not in the business of promoting the public interest. All too often, they are in the business of promoting their own interests, in the form of money, patronage, reelection, or whatever.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, I do not think I am exaggerating when I suggest that the voting public is reduced to thinking that &quot;my liar is better than your liar&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as opposed to believing that a public official really and truly cares about his constituents and the issues that directly affect their lives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State of Washington dealt with an earlier version of the same statute  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a previous case as well. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">119 Vote No</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Washington Supreme Court was confronted with a challenge to the statute prohibiting false political statements regarding a candidate or ballot measure with actual malice. The issue in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">119 Vote No</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dealt with Initiative 119, the proposed Death with Dignity Act, which would allow physician assisted suicides in the state.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) alleged that the 119 Vote No! Committee (the Committee) published political advertising stating their opposition to Initiative 119, which contained false statements in violation of the statute.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*78]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Committee's one page leaflet in opposition of Initiative 119 stated the following:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initiative 119: Vote No! -- No special qualifications -- your eye doctor could kill you; No rules against coercion -- Nothing to prevent selling the idea to the aged, the poor the homeless; No reporting requirements -- no records kept; No notification requirements - nobody need tell family members beforehand; No protection for the depressed -- No waiting period, no chance to change your mind; Initiative 119 ... Is a dangerous law -- Vote No on Initiative 119.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the Committee's leaflet, supporters of initiative 119 lodged a complaint with the PCB, and the PCB sought to assess the Committee, along with individual defendants, fines up to $ 10,000, plus costs, attorneys' fees, and treble damages.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the meantime, the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington (ACLU) intervened to challenge the statute's constitutionality.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eventually, the trial court determined that the Committee's leaflets did not have any false advertising that violated the statute and granted the Committee's motion to dismiss the PDC's complaint.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ACLU still pursued its claim for a declaratory judgment that the statute was facially invalid,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the State filed its own cross motion for a declaratory judgment that the statute was proper.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial court granted the State's motion, deciding that the statute was constitutional on its face,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and both parties appealed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal to the Washington Supreme Court, the State argued that the statute was necessary to give the voting public &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*79]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  truthful accurate information,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and can therefore make a well informed decision at the ballot box. The Washington Supreme Court, however, ruled that the statute was unconstitutional as it violated the First Amendment.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court had several justifications for declaring the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the court rejected the state's claim that it could prohibit false statements of fact in any political literature. &quot;This claim presupposes that the State possesses an independent right to determine truth and falsity in political debate. However, the courts have 'consistently refused to recognize an exception for any test of truth -- whether administered by judges, juries, or administrative officials -- and especially one that puts the burden of truth on the speaker.'&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As such, the court recognized that the First Amendment makes sure that it is the voting public who ultimately decides what is true or not in any political discourse.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, the state cannot impose its own will in preventing others from embellishing one's record, vilifying a political opponent, or even employing false statements.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next, the court theorized that whenever someone makes any factual mistakes (or even misrepresentations) the state is not in the best position to notice those misstatements and thus be the sole arbiter as to how the factual misstatements can be corrected. Instead, a political candidate's factual misstatements will quickly be exposed by his opponent and the opponent's supporters. &quot;In the political context, a campaign's factual blunder is most likely noticed and corrected by the campaign's political opponent, rather than the state.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*80]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Next, the court took the position that the statute generated an impermissible chilling effect on political speech in that the state will take the position of deciding what the political truth really is. &quot;RCW 42.17.530 coerces silence by force of law and presupposes that the state 'will separate the truth from the false' for the citizenry.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At its worst the statute is pure censorship, allowing government to undertake prosecution of citizens, who, in their view, have abused the right of political debate.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court also noted that the statute makes the state overly paternalistic, in that the state presumes that the average voter is not astute enough on his own to decipher the truth, so the state has to step in and figure out the truth for him.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the opinion in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">119 Vote No</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was unanimous in the judgment,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> some of the concurring opinions left no doubt that they believed that the overall opinion gave politicians a blank check to lie during campaign season. For example, Justice Guy's concurrence stated in no uncertain terms: &quot;Calculated lies are not protected political speech...Intentional, malicious lies do not foster debate; they foster deception and manipulation of the voting public.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Talmadge, although concurring, also blasts the possibility that the majority opinion not only opens the door to blatant lying, but also adds on one more factor leading to voter apathy. &quot;The majority is also shockingly oblivious to the increasing nastiness of modern [American] political campaigns. This trend is highlighted by a 'win at any cost' attitude involving vilification of opponents and their ideas. This new type of campaign neither illuminates, nor exemplifies the best of our &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*81]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  democratic tradition, and has caused too many of our fellow citizens to turn away from participation in the political process.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, I stand with Justices Guy and Talmadge and share their opinions in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">119 Vote No</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case. If one is always bombarded with candidates spewing nothing but venom and vitriol at each other, truth be damned, one might think: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">why bother</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? One can become convinced, to the point of becoming jaded, that neither candidate is telling the unvarnished truth during the campaign, and that the typical campaign is more of the same: hyperbole and hot air. Consequently, one might be very well reduced to not voting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c26">for</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> someone as much as voting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c26">against</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> someone else. This now becomes one's so-called &quot;informed&quot; choice of options: either vote for the better liar or not vote at all. Even if our ultimate weapon as voters is to vote liars out of office, I believe that this does not necessarily undo the political or legislative damage caused by an elected official who might have &quot;misrepresented&quot; his way into public office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">VI. FURTHER ATTEMPTS TO THWART FALSE POLITICAL SPEECH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A popular joke about politicians describes the following:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bus load of politicians were [sic] driving down a country road, when the bus ran off the road and crashed into a tree in an old farmer's field. The old farmer, after seeing what happened, went over to investigate. A few days later, the local sheriff came out looking for the missing politicos, saw the crashed bus, and asked the farmer where all the politicians had gone. The farmer said, &quot;I buried 'em all... out back.&quot; The sheriff then asked, &quot;Were they ALL dead?&quot; The old farmer replied, &quot;Well, some of them said they weren't, but you know how them politicians lie.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*82]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At this point in time, it would be an understatement to say that people are sorely disillusioned with the political process. People do not trust their elected officials. People are largely apathetic when it comes to voting. Negative attack ads are a dime a dozen. Amidst the very loud rhetoric, any serious talk about legitimate issues is rendered almost incidental. Truth and transparency amongst candidates and office holders are practically nonexistent. Consequently, it is very little wonder why the voting public is cynical about the political process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, several other states in addition to Washington have laws on their books that would impose sanctions for false campaign speech. For example, the state of Colorado criminalizes false campaign speech as either a class 1 or a class 2 misdemeanor,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which would subject the offender to a prison sentence or a fine, or both.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Florida, any political candidate who knowingly makes a false charge against an opponent has committed a third degree felony.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Minnesota, any party who knowingly participates in false campaign speech will be guilty of a gross misdemeanor.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tennessee considers false campaign speech to be a Class C misdemeanor,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> punishable by 30 days imprisonmnent, a maximum fine of $ 50, or both.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of this writing, I am not aware of any First Amendment challenges against any of these statutes. There will always be a tension between the state's interest in the voting public's having access to accurate information and one's freedom of speech. No one knows if the United States Supreme Court will again step in to address this particular issue of sanctioning knowingly false political speech. The Court has mentioned that speech is most &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*83]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  protected in the political realm, and that is ultimately the best way for voters to get the best information.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">VII. MORE REAL LIFE POLITICAL LIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">A. 2010 Connecticut Senatorial Election</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the race to replace retiring Connecticut Senator Christopher Dodd, Linda McMahon, the Chief Executive Officer of World Wrestling Entertainment, ran against Richard Blumenthal, who had been the state's attorney general since 1991. During the course of the campaign, Blumenthal had stated more than once that he had served in Vietnam. There was one slight problem with his representation of his military service: he had never served in Vietnam. &quot;Mr. Blumenthal, a Democrat now running for the United States Senate, never served in Vietnam. He obtained at least five military deferments from 1965 to 1970 and took repeated steps that enabled him to avoid going to war, according to records.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blumenthal eventually apologized for misrepresenting his record:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times when I have sought to honor veterans, I have not been as clear or precise as I should have been about my service in the Marine Corps Reserve. I have firmly and clearly expressed regret and taken responsibility for my words. I have made mistakes and I am sorry. I truly regret &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*84]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  offending anyone. I will always champion the cause of Connecticut's and our nation's reserves.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blumenthal made his misstatements while he was still Connecticut's attorney general, the chief law enforcement officer of the state. The state statute for the oath of office for members of the state assembly and executive branch (including the attorney general) states the following:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You do solemnly swear (or affirm as the case may be) that you will support the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of the State of Connecticut, so long as you continue to be a citizen thereof, and that you will faithfully discharge, according to law, the duties of the office of. ..to the best of your abilities; so help you God.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would assume that the attorney general's duties have an implied obligation of good faith, which is defined as honesty in fact.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What happened as a result of Blumenthal's getting caught in his lie? Not much, really. Yes, he suffered (some) acute embarrassment for a while, but, ultimately, that did not ruin his campaign, nor did he suffer any legal sanction for it. In November 2010, Blumenthal soundly won the election and he is now the junior senator from the State of Connecticut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">B. Governor Eliot Spitzer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spitzer served two terms as the attorney general from the State of New York from 1999 to 2007, and then was elected governor in the November 2006 election. Spitzer served as governor from January 2007 to March 2008. Spitzer's public reputation was that of a hard-charging, tough as nails, law-and-order &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*85]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  individual who had very little tolerance for white collar corruption. One of his most famous political comments was &quot;I am a f[***]ing steamroller and I'll roll over you or anybody else.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democrat Spitzer made the remark to Republican Assemblyman James Tedesco in a private meeting.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately for Spitzer, his career as a &quot;steamrolling&quot; politician came to an ignominious end when he was discovered to have repeatedly frequented an expensive &quot;escort&quot; service called, &quot;The Emperor's Club.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Emperor's Club&quot; was in fact a front for an expensive prostitution ring. Spitzer's dalliances came to the surface as a result of a routine IRS investigation into questionable wire transfers between bank accounts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, during his time as attorney general, Spitzer prosecuted prostitution rings similar to the very one he regularly patronized.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The married Spitzer was identified in the escort service's records as &quot;Client Number 9.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In disgrace, Spitzer resigned as governor on March 12, 2008.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all of Spitzer's embarrassment, he amazingly landed on his feet. Believe it or not, he is not under any threat of criminal indictment as of this writing, and there has not been any talk about him losing his law license. Next, he was able to land an adjunct teaching position at New York's City College in September 2009. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*86]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He taught a fifteen week Political Science course called &quot;Law and Public Policy.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Additionally, he had his own political talk program on the cable network CNN called &quot;In the Arena,&quot; in which he was the de facto star of the show after the departure of his original co-host, columnist Kathleen Parker.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN cancelled the show in July 2011 because of low ratings.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In light of this, it is not so far-fetched that Spitzer could eventually become a law school professor teaching a course in Legal Ethics. I would ask, however, if a private citizen in Spitzer's situation would have received similar treatment from law enforcement. I'd seriously doubt it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">C. Congressman Anthony Weiner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weiner was a former member of the House of Representatives, representing New York's Ninth Congressional District from 1999 to 2011. In the spring of 2011, Weiner was caught sending several sexually suggestive pictures of himself (and of a certain body part) to various women all over the country, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">none of whom</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were his wife.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To make matters worse, Weiner tried to cover up his misdeeds by fabricating a story that someone (perhaps a political adversary) hacked into his personal Twitter account to make it appear as if he himself had sent the &quot;naughty&quot; pictures. &quot;I didn't send the photograph. My account was apparently hacked or &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*87]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  somehow people got access to it.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Weiner also had the gumption to tell anyone who would listen that he could not say with any exactitude that the body part in question was actually his.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several days of denying that he sent the pictures, Weiner held a press conference on June 6, 2011 in which he finally admitted that he sent the pictures of himself.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After several days of refusing to resign his seat (during which even President Barack Obama said that if it had been him, he would have stepped down immediately  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), Weiner finally submitted his official letter of resignation from Congress on June 20, 2011, effective June 21, 2011.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As of this writing, Weiner is currently seeking therapy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be small consolation in light of his &quot;sexting&quot; misadventures, but I imagine that it will not be long before Weiner experiences a &quot;comeback&quot; similar to Spitzer. He too could get his own talk show, write a best seller, teach a political ethics course, or perhaps guest host an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In any event, it is only a matter of time before this episode of &quot;Weiner and his . . . well, you know&quot; . . . fades from the public consciousness and we will all be knee deep in the next political scandal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">du jour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*88]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, there have been many married political figures who have indulged in extramarital affairs since the beginning of time. This is not exactly breaking news. These would include governors, presidents, mayors, congressmen, kings, and the like (John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Bill Clinton, Ted Kennedy, Mark Sanford, John Edwards, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Newt Gingrich, and Nelson Rockefeller, to name just a few). One would assume that one of the obligations of any political office holder would be, either expressly or implicitly, to conduct his government business affairs (pardon the pun) with transparent honesty. Naturally, any extra-marital excursion would necessitate lying to one's spouse about one's whereabouts (I am not speaking from personal experience). I do not believe that it is outside the realm of possibility to suggest that if a philandering public official cannot be truthful with a spouse, it is probably unlikely to believe that same public official would be any more truthful with his constituents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">VIII. UNTRUSTWORTHY LAW ENFORCEMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another area in which the public trust in government agents is sorely lacking is in law enforcement. The police motto is &quot;to protect and serve.&quot; Unfortunately, however, there are too many lurid stories about police officers who racially profile. There are too many lurid stories about police officers who shoot unarmed, defenseless citizens (in New York, four plainclothes police officers fired forty one shots at Amadou Diallo, an innocent man standing in front of his building, hitting him nineteen times and killing him; in Oakland, a member of the Bay Area Rapid Transit police shot and killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also unarmed. Videotape evidence suggests that Grant was on the ground and handcuffed when he was shot.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n136</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*89]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There are too many lurid stories about police officers who manufacture probable cause after the fact (police officer caught on tape deliberately knocking a cyclist off his bike and subsequently lying about what happened),  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n137</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and perjure themselves in court (video surveillance tape caught police officers in a testimonial lie.).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n138</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are even stories about police officers who lie about quotas for writing traffic tickets.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n139</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Occasionally, these individuals who commit these wrongful acts are brought to justice.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n140</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More often than not, they are acquitted of all charges,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n141</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and do not get as much as a slap on the wrist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could obviously cite many other examples (and many others have a great job of doing so elsewhere) that would support the proposition that not all law enforcement agents are trustworthy. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*90]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I acknowledge that there are many honest law enforcement agents who perform a dangerous, high pressure, and often thankless job. I mention these well-known incidents just to show that this is one more area of public service where situations involving dishonesty are not isolated incidents. This is especially true with the so-called &quot;blue wall of silence.&quot; The &quot;wall&quot; is an unwritten police code that suggests that an officer will never rat on his own -- no matter how heinous the act. For these reasons, not surprisingly, there is a sizeable segment of society that justifiably does not trust law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">A. The Constitutionality of Police Deception</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stories of police misconduct notwithstanding, there is an undeniable tension between the state's compelling interest in neutralizing crime and a citizen's constitutional rights. For example, a citizen is constitutionally protected from unreasonable search and seizure.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n142</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next, the state cannot compel a citizen to be a witness against himself.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n143</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A citizen who is a defendant in a criminal trial has a constitutional right to counsel.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n144</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement officials conducting criminal investigations, however, have often resorted to trickery and deception to circumvent an individual's constitutional protections. Amazingly, courts have upheld certain deceptive practices as constitutionally valid. In other words, deceptive police practices have resulted in arrests, not-so voluntary confessions, and subsequent criminal convictions that have withstood constitutional challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">Texas v. Gray</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n145</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Texas Appellate Criminal Court upheld a police officer's pretextual traffic stop as justification for his searching the defendant for drugs. The police officer received a tip from an informant that the defendant was going to transport drugs on a particular night.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n146</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police officer &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*91]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  did not otherwise have probable cause to search for drugs based on the allegedly routine traffic stop.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n147</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police officer arrested the defendant for the traffic violation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n148</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the police officer's extensive search eventually revealed that the defendant did in fact have drugs on his person.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n149</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">Illinois v. Perkins</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n150</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the U.S. Supreme Court held that a defendant's admissions to a law enforcement officer disguised as a prison inmate did not rise to the level of police coercion procuring an involuntary confession. &quot;Conversations between suspects and undercover agents do not implicate the concerns underlying Miranda. The essential ingredients of a 'police-dominated atmosphere' and compulsion are not present when an incarcerated person speaks freely to someone that he believes to be a fellow inmate.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n151</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">U.S. v. Byram</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n152</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the court stated that &quot;trickery is not automatically coercion. Indeed, the police commonly engage in such ruses as suggesting to a suspect that a confederate has just confessed or that police have or will secure physical evidence against the suspect. While the line between ruse and coercion is sometimes blurred, confessions procured by deceits have been held voluntary in a number of situations.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n153</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">Moran v. Burbine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n154</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the defendant had been arrested for burglary and was also a suspect in a murder investigation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n155</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before Burbine had been indicted on either charge, his sister hired an attorney to represent him.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n156</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the attorney contacted the police station where Burbine was held, she (the attorney) was unable to contact him, and was notified by the police that Burbine &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*92]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would neither be put in a police lineup or questioned that evening.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n157</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attorney was unaware that Burbine was also a murder suspect.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n158</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police had never notified Burbine that an attorney had been retained, and they interrogated Burbine that same night.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n159</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After voluntarily waiving his Miranda rights, Burbine eventually confessed to the murder.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n160</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Burbine appealed his conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court, the court upheld his conviction on the grounds that Burbine was fully aware of his Miranda rights. The court also noted the fact that the police deliberately misled the attorney about Burbine's interrogation did not rise to the level of a forced confession:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whether intentional or inadvertent, the state of mind of the police is irrelevant to the question of the intelligence and voluntariness of respondent's election to abandon his rights. Although highly inappropriate, even deliberate deception of an attorney could not possibly affect a suspect's decision to waive his Miranda rights unless he were at least aware of the incident.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n161</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undoubtedly, none of the defendants in the above cases would ever be nominated for sainthood. Even with that, the law is supposed to be fair and impartial. However, I think some can also be hard pressed to see the fairness of the legal system when it is a knowing participant in trickery and deception, no matter how noble the motive might be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*93]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">B. False Confessions, Wrongful Convictions, Deceptions, and the Attorneys who Dive Right In</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, there are any number of attorneys in practice who do not let little things like truth and justice get in the way of winning cases. There are many documented cases of prosecuting attorneys who let police officers take the stand knowing that they are about to perjure themselves.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n162</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Still, police, prosecutors and judges often ignore the practice of false testimony by looking at it as a means of justifying the ends of law enforcement, seeing the fourth amendment as a protection of the guilty and the act of lying to get around it as merely 'evening the odds' in the war on drugs.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n163</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a horrible perversion of the old adage that &quot;two wrongs don't make a right.&quot; The line of thinking now becomes while two wrongs do not make a right, two wrongs will surely get you even.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only will some attorneys support a witness committing perjury, they will even actively hide the truth to make sure they win their cases.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n164</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One notorious murder case had a prosecuting attorney prosecute two defendants, who were black, when the district attorney had eyewitness testimony that the assailants were in fact white.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n165</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prosecutor never disclosed this exculpatory evidence to the defense.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n166</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luckily, the defendants' convictions were overturned when the exculpatory evidence was discovered later.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n167</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still another notorious case was that of Rolando Cruz, who was convicted and sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*94]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ten year old girl.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n168</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His conviction had been based on, among other things, the testimony of two police officers who said that Cruz confessed to the crime, but had no videotape or other record of his confession.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n169</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cruz's conviction was overturned twice during the ten years he was on death row.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n170</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, the prosecution re-filed the charges against Cruz, even in the face of DNA evidence that exonerated him of the crime.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n171</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After ten years on death row, the murder charge against Cruz was finally dropped. Interestingly, three of the prosecuting attorneys and four of the police officers who testified as to Cruz's alleged confession were themselves subsequently prosecuted for conspiracy to frame Cruz.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n172</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All were acquitted.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n173</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next, there are even situations where an attorney will attempt to rationalize deception as a means to get wanted criminals off the street, and that his heart was actually in the right place. One such case in Colorado involved Mark Paulter, who was a chief district attorney who engaged in a major deception to help trap a vicious killer.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n174</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was at a gruesome murder scene where three women were bludgeoned to death and had their skulls caved in, and a fourth had been raped at the scene.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n175</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The man responsible for the carnage was William Neal.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n176</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neal had notified the authorities by phone that he would not surrender without legal representation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n177</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of contacting the public defender's &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*95]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  office, Paulter agreed with the police officers at the scene that he would pose as a public defender that would represent Neal.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n178</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paulter introduced himself to Neal as &quot;Mark Palmer,&quot; the public defender who would represent him.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n179</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paulter had phone conversations with Neal that were taped by the police, and Neal eventually turned himself in without incident.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n180</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paulter's ruse came to light when the head of the public defender's office recognized Paulter's voice on the tape recordings.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n181</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state review board determined that Paulter violated two sections of the Colorado Rules of Professional Conduct,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n182</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and imposed sanctions against him.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n183</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Colorado Supreme Court upheld the sanctions against Paulter.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n184</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In doing so, the court let Paulter know in no uncertain terms that attorney honesty is always paramount:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jokes, cynicism, and falling public confidence related to lawyers and the legal system may signal that we are not living up to our obligation; but, they certainly do not signal that the obligation itself has eroded. For example, the profession itself is engaging in a nation-wide project designed to emphasize that truthfulness, honesty and candor are the core of the core values of the legal profession. Lawyers themselves are recognizing that the public perception that lawyers twist words to meet their own goals and pay little attention to the truth, strikes at the very heart of the profession -- as well as at the heart of the system of justice. Lawyers serve our system of justice, and if lawyers are dishonest, then there is a perception that the system, too, must be dishonest. Certainly, the reality of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*96]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such behavior must be abjured so that the perception may diminish.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n185</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State of Colorado dealt with the issue of attorney deception in an earlier case as well.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n186</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> James Mitchell Smith was suspended from practicing law for two years.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n187</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Smith had agreed with local law enforcement to become a government informant and clandestinely tape phone conversations with a former client of his (under the premise of purchasing cocaine from the former client), who was a known drug dealer.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n188</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Smith agreed to the ruse because he received assurances from the state Attorney General's office that the subterfuge did not violate the state's Code of Professional Responsibility.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n189</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Smith also agreed to the arrangement because he feared that he would be subject to criminal charges for his own drug use.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n190</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to Smith's cooperation, the former client made incriminating statements, was arrested and eventually pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n191</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court, however, was not impressed with Smith's contention that he was working in concert with law enforcement:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We do not comment in this opinion what some jurisdictions have expressly recognized as a prosecutorial exception to the general rule that the standards for prohibiting deceit, dishonesty and fraud preclude attorneys from surreptitiously recording communications with clients and others. The respondent, however, was a private attorney, not a prosecuting attorney. We do not agree that the above described policy considerations permit private counsel to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*97]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  deal dishonestly and deceitfully with clients, former clients, and others.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n192</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consequently, the court agreed with the recommendation of the Grievance Committee and upheld Smith's suspension from the practice of law.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n193</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c5">IX. CONCLUSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theoretically, political office holders, police officers, and attorneys are in fiduciary positions. They are holders of public trust. Political office holders swear to uphold the federal and state constitutions. Police officers are supposed to serve and protect when upholding the law. Attorneys, as officers of the court, are supposed to be zealous advocates for their clients' positions and pursue justice. In addition to holding the public trust, these public officials are supposed to uphold the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, we have seen all too often that this does not always happen. We have seen too many instances of not only criminal acts, but also attempts to cover up those crimes. Some elected officials do not always follow the law they are supposed to uphold. To add insult to injury, several of these elected officials used to be practicing attorneys and, thus, should have known better. Some police officers frequently break the very same laws they are supposed to enforce. Some attorneys try to bend the rules, not to pursue justice, but to win at all costs -- justice be damned. In those situations, truth is not a virtue. Again, this article is not a blanket demonization of all government agents; indeed, there are many government agents who perform their jobs with due diligence and unshakeable integrity. Still, if left unchecked, one bad apple could eventually spoil the whole barrel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, after witnessing so many breaches of honesty and ethics one can easily have the sense that the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*98]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  relationship between government agents and the people they are supposed to serve has become &quot;them and us.&quot; &quot;Do as we say,&quot; but not &quot;do as we do.&quot; Thus, many people tend to believe that the very government agents who are duty bound to help them will more likely do them harm instead. It is as if dealing with government agents is like playing a Las Vegas casino: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c26">the game is rigged to favor the house</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Evidently, the government does not work for us anymore. The worm has turned, and it looks more like we work for the government. When it comes to the government, whose operation is financed by the taxpayers, (&quot;we the people&quot;),  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n194</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lying is a one way street. We cannot lie to the government. However, as this piece has shown, the government can lie to us in a zillion different ways and hide under the Constitution to get away with it. Thus, it seems that all &quot;we the people&quot; are in relation to the government is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29">in its way</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. This means, as I see it, our government does as it pleases. There is really no such thing as the government doing &quot;the people's business,&quot; as politicians like to say. Consequently, our government is now completely oblivious to the wishes of the people it allegedly serves.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c5"> LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ... Arguments from immigrant advocates, immigration scholars, and even some law enforcement agencies that anti-immigrant legislation leads to immigrant underreporting of crimes and ultimately endangers entire communities, have not yet yielded favorable results.  ... Part II addresses the concerns that immigrant advocates may have that a commitment to silence may further isolate and even endanger immigrant communities.  ... In some jurisdictions that have signed up to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement with police civil immigration violations, the rhetoric from police authorities sends a clear message to the immigrant community that the police are anti-immigrant and hostile to the legitimate crime concerns of noncitizens.  ... A look at the criminalization of immigrants in the employment context provides some insight into the difficult decision that undocumented immigrants must now make between matters of personal safety and discrimination versus deportation.  ... Concerns that local enforcement of federal immigration law will lead immigrant communities to avoid the police, thereby making communities as a whole less safe, will be discussed in conjunction with concerns about racial profiling and the financial costs of such programs.  ... As can be seen by the growing number of partnerships between local police departments and federal immigration agents to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants, it is clear that many local police officials consider undocumented immigrants to be merely criminals.  ... Local law enforcement officials that are critical of the cross-deputization of local police to enforce federal immigration laws generally focus their objections on three likely outcomes: (1) that community safety will suffer as undocumented witnesses choose not to report crimes, (2) that cross-deputization of local police will result in their officers racially profiling Latino residents, and (3) that the financial burden on their local police budgets will be too great.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c5">HIGHLIGHT: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time referred to as &quot;an unprecedented era of immigration enforcement,&quot; undocumented immigrants who have the misfortune to witness a crime in this country face a terrible decision. Calling the police to report that crime will likely lead to questions that reveal a witness's immigration status, resulting in detention and deportation for the undocumented immigrant witness. Programs like Secure Communities and 287(g) partnerships evidence an increase in local immigration enforcement, and this Article argues that undocumented witnesses' only logical response to these programs is silence. Silence, in the form of a complete refusal to call the police to report crime or participate in local prosecutions, is a potent and defensible act of civil disobedience by the estimated twenty-two million immigrants in this country with anything less than full-citizenship status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a growing body of empirical evidence showing that local immigration enforcement leads to racial profiling, is unjustifiably expensive for local crime-fighting budgets, and results in the local immigrant population simply deciding not to call the police for any reason at all. This Article takes those arguments one step further, contending that immigrant communities can take matters into their own hands and protect themselves by choosing silence as an organized response to a regime that has rendered local police a threat, not a support, to millions of people within our borders. A commitment to silence by the immigrant community will lend a sense of urgency to these protests and spur real action from local law enforcement officials who appreciate the dangers of prioritizing immigration enforcement over community safety for all residents, citizen and noncitizen alike.<BR>&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INTRODUCTION<BR>&nbsp;<BR> On December 29, 2009, Abel Moreno called the police in Charlotte, North Carolina to report that a man was assaulting his girlfriend. He told police that a Charlotte police officer, Officer Marcus Jackson, was fondling his girlfriend during a traffic stop. After Mr. Moreno made these allegations, five other women came forward and reported that Officer Jackson had also tried to molest them. Officer Jackson was fired and now faces eleven counts of sexual battery, extortion, and interfering with emergency communication. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n1</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a direct result of his cooperation with police, however, Mr. Moreno now faces deportation to his country of origin, Mexico. The Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office in Charlotte is &quot;one of sixty-seven local law enforcement agencies in twenty-four states that have signed up under Section 287(g) of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act,&quot; which deputizes local law enforcement officials, allowing them to enforce federal immigration laws as part of their normal duties. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After Mr. Moreno made his call to police to report the crime, he was arrested and jailed himself when authorities investigated his immigration status and discovered that he was undocumented. A judge granted Mr. Moreno a six-month deferment on his deportation because he was a witness in a criminal investigation, but those six months ended November 2010, with no relief from deportation available for Mr. Moreno. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The above story was broadcast on a local NBC news channel in North Carolina and was available online to a much broader audience for &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*121]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  several weeks. It is likely that thousands, if not tens of thousands of people read about Mr. Moreno's plight in the news. If any of those readers are undocumented or in possession of less than full-citizenship status in this country, the lesson they learned was clear: noncitizen witnesses that call the police to report a crime will likely face swift and brutal consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a time being called &quot;an era of unprecedented immigration enforcement,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> undocumented immigrant witnesses to local crimes face a terrible quandary. If they have the misfortune to witness a crime against a loved one, a neighbor or even a complete stranger, picking up the telephone to offer information to local police is entirely out of the question. With the expansion of government programs such as the 287(g) agreements </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Secure Communities, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which enlist the help of local police to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration laws, undocumented immigrant witnesses can no longer risk contacting the police to report crimes for fear that they will be questioned about their immigration status. Discovery of their status could lead to detention and possible deportation from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A simple analysis of the pros and cons of calling the police will most certainly lead undocumented immigrant witnesses to conclude that reporting a crime to local police will place them in the crosshairs of immigration officials. Once in those crosshairs, the outcome will most likely be catastrophic. The losses of their freedom, their employment, and their home are not only possibilities, but in some jurisdictions today, absolute guarantees. Such costs are unthinkable for most, and will indisputably outweigh any benefit received from involving the police in solving or stopping crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem of immigrant underreporting of crimes for fear of deportation is by no means a new development. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the recent proliferation of federal and state legislation targeting undocumented immigrants, coupled with the spread of federal programs such as Section 287(g) agreements and Secure Communities, has created a new, frightening landscape for the immigrant community. Arguments from immigrant advocates, immigration scholars, and even some law enforcement agencies that &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*122]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  anti-immigrant legislation leads to immigrant underreporting of crimes and ultimately endangers entire communities, have not yet yielded favorable results. Numerous states are proposing legislation similar to Arizona's harsh anti-immigration law, Senate Bill 1070, which grants local police the power to try and determine the immigration status of the people they contact and detain them should the police believe they are undocumented. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, the police and the laws they enforce are not a source of safety or redress for undocumented immigrants today; they are a threat and a frightening menace to be avoided at all costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Article argues that the only logical option for undocumented immigrant witnesses to crime in this punitive and unpredictable legal and social climate is silence. A complete refusal to call the police to report any crime whatsoever would serve as the last line of defense for an immigrant community facing the harsh reality that the Obama administration deported a record number of people in fiscal year 2010. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given those numbers, an organized commitment to silence on the part of the immigrant community is both reasonable and legally defensible as a form of civil disobedience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigrant advocates may be concerned that a public commitment to silence would lead to the increased victimization of an already vulnerable community, but the present reality of immigrant underreporting necessitates drastic action. This Article submits that immigrant advocates, law enforcement and the American public should be aware of two realities: first, the current anti-immigrant climate in this country has already led immigrants to underreport crimes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, the acceleration of state and federal cooperation agreements to identify and deport human beings has gone unchecked. Criticisms of Secure Communities and 287(g) partnerships by immigrant advocates and even prominent members of law enforcement have both fiscal and legal merit, but have largely fallen on deaf ears. Valid objections to such partnerships would be amplified and &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*123]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  strengthened by strategies to involve the immigrant community itself in the movement for a humane and realistic solution to immigration reform in this country. Immigrant communities can become involved in the movement to protect their rights and their humanity in this country by making a conscientious decision to choose silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This decision to choose silence lends a new urgency to the response of local police officials who have already begun to publicly voice their concerns about enlisting local police to enforce federal immigration laws. Several prominent members of local law enforcement find themselves in the unusual position of agreeing with immigrant advocates that aggressive immigration enforcement at the local level will increase racial profiling by the police and discourage immigrant witnesses from reporting crime, thereby rendering their communities less safe. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, programs that require local police not only to investigate local crimes but also to enforce possible federal immigration violations face several problems. First, asking local police to detect potential immigration violations in their communities invites the inevitable outcome that some residents will be racially profiled as undocumented immigrants, regardless of their citizenship status. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, once the immigrant community learns of local police partnerships with federal immigration agents, they will take every measure necessary to avoid contact with the police. Local police chiefs recognize that undocumented immigrant witnesses to crime will simply choose the logical alternative - to remain silent - given the likelihood that calling the police to report that crime will result in an inquiry into their immigration status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*124]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Part I of this Article makes the argument that silence is the logical recourse for the undocumented immigrant witness to crime. Silence, in the form of a complete withdrawal from participation with local law enforcement, is not only rational, but defensible as a form of civil disobedience in the punitive and unpredictable legal environment for immigrants in this country. Part II addresses the concerns that immigrant advocates may have that a commitment to silence may further isolate and even endanger immigrant communities. This section also describes what such a movement would entail and how the immigrant community can be educated and involved in a commitment to silence. Part III discusses the criticisms leveled at federal programs such as 287(g) and Secure Communities that cross-deputize local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws, highlighting concerns that immigrants will, as a result of these programs, avoid all contact with the police. Part IV encourages local police officials that have already recognized the danger of a withdrawal into silence by the immigrant community to become actively involved in the push to leave federal immigration enforcement in the hands of the federal government and to advocate for currently non-existent protections for undocumented witnesses. The police must act to defend the entire community they are tasked with serving and protecting, citizen and noncitizen alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>!Silencio! A Call for Organized Silence as Civil Disobedience<BR>&nbsp;<BR> On February 16, 2009, Rita Cote called the police in Tavares, Florida on behalf of her sister, who could not speak English, to report that her sister was the victim of domestic violence. When the police arrived at Ms. Cote's house, they asked everyone in the house for identification, and requested Ms. Cote's passport after she gave them an identification card with her married name. When police learned that Ms. Cote is in the country illegally, they took her into custody, detained her in jail for a week, and contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Cote is married to a United States citizen who is a retired member of the armed forces. They have four children, all of whom are citizens. She has no criminal record. She arrived in the United States as a minor from her native Honduras in 1998, escaping the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch. She now faces deportation at any time, and, if forced to leave the country, may be separated from her husband and her children for up to a decade. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*125]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The average United States citizen does not contemplate the possibility that contacting the police to report a crime could result in detention by those same police. For the average undocumented resident in this country, however, this possibility is an ever-present reality. For a sizable segment of our population, the police are not a welcome or even innocuous presence; they are a threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That a witness to a crime would decide to remain silent is likely already a frequent occurrence in this country. In Mr. Moreno's case (discussed above), even the police who arrested him acknowledged that his phone call led to the arrest of a &quot;dirty cop.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same police also agreed that Mr. Moreno should not have been arrested after making the report once his immigration status was discovered. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he was. After reporting a domestic violence incident, Ms. Cote spent a week in jail and now faces deportation and forced separation from her family. Had she decided not to call the police, she would have avoided detention and the specter of deportation for a while longer, but her sister would have remained at the mercy of her abuser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to quantify how many crimes go unreported to the police by undocumented immigrants; however, common sense suggests that the number is substantial. Newspaper accounts of undocumented immigrant witnesses being detained by immigration officials after contacting local police appear periodically in local papers and they are ominous warnings to the immigrant community that silence is often the better option. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one well-publicized case in Louisiana, six undocumented immigrants in Slidell were held at the local jail for eight months solely because prosecutors believed that they had witnessed the murder of their roommate, another undocumented immigrant. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prosecutor sought material witness warrants to detain the witnesses because he feared the men might come to the attention of federal immigration authorities and &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*126]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be deported before the homicide case came to trial. In the affidavit in support of his request for material witness warrants, the prosecutor alleged that all six men were either &quot;eyewitnesses to the homicide&quot; or possessed evidence &quot;critical to the presentation of the case.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The six men were not provided lawyers, nor were they were brought to court for a status hearing during their eight months of incarceration; they later told the judge that they did not know why they were being held. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several of the men believed they were suspects in the homicide. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Orleans Times Picayune ran several articles about the plight of the six undocumented witnesses. Each story reiterated the fact that none of the men were accused of a crime; rather, they had the misfortune of witnessing the murder of their roommate. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The immigrant community in Louisiana likely followed the Slidell story with horrified dismay. The combination of witnessing a crime and being undocumented was a disastrous one for the six men who spent eight months of their lives in jail, unable to work, unable to understand what was happening to them, and without access to attorneys. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scholars have already picked up on and studied the silencing effect that allowing police to enforce federal immigration violations may have on undocumented immigrants who are the victims of crime. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the context of undocumented victims of sexual trafficking in the United States, Professor Jennifer M. Chacon writes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>U.S. immigration law and policy unintentionally helps traffickers assert control over victims once those victims are in the United States. Unauthorized peoples are more vulnerable to threats because they know that efforts to seek legal recourse can result in protracted immigration detention, criminal prosecution, and, of course, removal. The legal limbo of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*127]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unauthorized migrants has left many migrant laborers reluctant to report crimes and labor violations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> There has been little attention paid, however, to the numbers of witnesses to crimes who are unwilling to contact the police for the same reasons. Undocumented immigrant witnesses to crime undoubtedly outnumber the undocumented victims of crime in this country. Undocumented persons who have not been directly victimized but are only contemplating whether to report harm committed upon someone else have less incentive to report, since they have no personal investment in capturing the perpetrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undocumented immigrant witnesses are generally not eligible for the subsets of specialized visas, U visas, and T visas that currently exist, albeit in limited numbers, for undocumented immigrant victims. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> S visas, colloquially known as &quot;snitch visas,&quot; are the only visas potentially available to undocumented immigrant witnesses. But S visas are specifically available only to those who have information regarding a &quot;criminal&quot; or &quot;terrorist organization.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of undocumented witnesses and informants who may be admitted to the United States through the S visa program is limited by Congressional mandate to 250 per year, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and they are usually reserved as bargaining chips for terrorism suspects who have agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with government prosecutors in terrorism investigations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Orde F. Kittrie writes, &quot;the S, T, and U visas are too narrow in scope and limited in availability to have an impact on more than a small proportion of even the violent crimes committed against unauthorized aliens in the United States.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On July 21, 2010, Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that they had already reached the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*128]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  10,000-visa limit for visas available to undocumented crime victims. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact that all of the visas available to victims who cooperate with prosecutors in solving local crimes were exhausted just a few months after they became available in 2010 shows how necessary they are in the successful investigation and prosecution of local crimes. Even so, Kittrie writes,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>the S, T, and U visa criteria are so narrowly defined that many unauthorized alien victims of violent crimes are not eligible for some or all of these visas. For example, a lone thug's shooting of an unauthorized alien victim in the course of a robbery gone awry would fit neither the S-visa (no &quot;criminal organization or enterprise&quot;) nor the T-visa (no trafficking involved). Whether the shooting would fit the U-visa criteria would depend on whether the forthcoming regulations include such shootings within the ambit of &quot;substantial physical or mental abuse.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Undocumented immigrant witnesses have been left with little recourse should they have the misfortune to witness a crime committed against anyone in this country, citizen or noncitizen. Their one remaining act of rational self-preservation in this environment may simply be to remain silent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. The Case for Silence<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In the face of a civil immigration enforcement regime that has increasingly made use of the more punitive elements of our criminal law to swiftly penalize, detain, and deport thousands of undocumented residents without due process, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a commitment to silence by the immigrant community is not only powerful, it is rational. Using this means of empowerment and basic self-preservation, undocumented immigrant witnesses to crime can - and should - withdraw as a unified front in a promise to remain silent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*129]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Organized efforts to inform immigrant communities about the dangers of interacting with police have occurred in local communities before. In the summer of 2008, posters began to appear in public places in Alamance County, North Carolina, warning Latinos to avoid law enforcement officers at all costs. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One such poster read:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Attention Hispanos! It is respectfully advised NOT to speak with police in Alamance because of the decision of the sheriff ... and county commissioners ... who have authorized local police to trap and arrest unauthorized immigrants ... . Avoid them as if you would avoid the devil. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> In today's anti-immigrant climate, a call for the immigrant community to avoid the police and withdraw into silence is appropriate and should be sounded nationwide. The American public's hysteria over &quot;criminal aliens,&quot; coupled with exaggerated and sometimes blatantly untrue reports of an explosion of violence along the U.S.-Mexico border, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has created a truly frightening and unpredictable environment for immigrants living in this country who possess anything less than full legal status. In some jurisdictions that have signed up to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement with police civil immigration violations, the rhetoric from police authorities sends a clear message to the immigrant community that the police are anti-immigrant and hostile to the legitimate crime concerns of noncitizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Pendergraph, the former Sheriff of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, made the following statements: &quot;We've got millions of illegal immigrants that have no business being here ... . These people are coming to our country without documents, and they won't even assimilate ... this is about homeland security. This is about the sovereignty of our country.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When asked if he advocated &quot;rounding up Latinos&quot; that live in the country without legal status, Pendergraph was not opposed to the idea. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*130]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alamance County Commissioner Tim Sutton, who was instrumental in the adoption of the 287(g) Program in his county in North Carolina, discussed the intent of the program by noting, &quot;287(g) deters local crime by illegal aliens. But that's not the only thing I am after. I want illegal aliens, to be honest with you, out of here. I don't blink an eye.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undocumented immigrants are publicly vilified by an increasingly anxious, fearful, and sometimes blatantly racist segment of the citizen population susceptible to the scaremongering tactics of the conservative media. Despite statistics from the Border Patrol that show that the flow of illegal immigrants from our southern borders is clearly in decline, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 65 percent of the American public who participated in a CBS/Times poll in May 2010 identified immigration as a &quot;very serious problem,&quot; up from 54 percent in 2006. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wide majorities of the participants in the poll also stated that they expected laws like the Arizona bill to be a burden to police departments, lead to racial profiling of Latino residents, and result in Latinos, legal and undocumented, being less inclined to report crimes to police. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite those concerns, 51 percent of the people polled believed that the proposed legislation is &quot;about right&quot; in its approach. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This deeply entrenched anti-immigrant sentiment is a powerful political force resulting in campaign promises by politicians across the country to do what they can to deport the &quot;illegal invaders&quot; as fast as possible. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several states hoping to emulate the recent Arizona legislation seek to purge their jurisdictions of noncitizens through a strategy called &quot;attrition through enforcement.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lack of procedural due process protections for noncitizens prosecuted by ICE officials in civil removal &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*131]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proceedings adds another frightening layer of unpredictability for residents who could be subject to deportation and detention by police. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Silence as Civil Disobedience<BR>&nbsp;<BR> This country has a long history of resistance by the people to laws perceived to be unjust or cruel. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harriet Tubman organized the Underground Railroad to help Blacks enslaved in the South escape to the North, and to escape the law in many Southern states that still allowed Whites to own Blacks as common property. During the civil rights movement, Martin Luther King, Jr. encouraged Black people and sympathetic White activists to participate in illegal marches and sit-ins to oppose laws that were perceived to be racist and unjust. Going one step further, Malcolm X advocated a strategy to achieve the liberation of Black people &quot;by any means necessary.&quot; One scholar characterized Malcolm X's &quot;any means necessary&quot; as a &quot;defiant phrase that threatens the establishment, opposes the notion of law and order, and exposes the failure of the legal system to provide justice.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his essay titled &quot;Civil Disobedience,&quot; Henry David Thoreau wrote, &quot;All men recognize the right of revolution; that is, the right to refuse allegiance to, and to resist, the government, when its tyranny or its inefficiency are great and unendurable.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The retreat into silence by the immigrant community today has already begun. Failing to report a crime, however, is a crime in several states, placing the noncitizen witness in a catch-22 situation, where they weigh the dangers of deportation against the danger of prosecution for failing to report. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This Article makes the case for a refusal to report crimes to the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*132]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  police as a legitimate act of civil disobedience in objection to an unjust civil and criminal enforcement regime that effectively penalizes undocumented residents for having witnessed a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laws that effectively encourage immigrants to avoid the police and to therefore forego the benefit of any assistance for crimes committed against them and/or others have been discussed in the First Amendment context as a violation of the right to &quot;petition the Government for redress of grievances.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This Article takes that argument one step further, urging every immigrant living in this country with anything less than full citizenship status to choose not to redress grievances with the police, in objection to an unjust and frightening reality imposed upon them by unjust laws. The response from the immigrant community should take the form of organized silence and a complete refusal to participate in the criminal justice system as witnesses for the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. A Proposal for Organizing Silence and a Response to Advocates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. A Call to the Community<BR>&nbsp;<BR> An organized call for silence from the undocumented immigrant community would not be logistically complicated or difficult to market as a tactic of choice. There would be no need to organize any marches, sit- &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*133]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ins, or visible demonstrations at all; indeed, such public protests are unwise for the undocumented population anyway since identification by the police is to be avoided. The benefit of choosing silence as the primary tactic for protesters is that it is, by its nature, a passive act. Refusing to speak out is one of the few things that the immigrant community can do privately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal is both simple and precise: realistic and humane immigration reform that does not place immigrants at risk for speaking up. It is a necessary part of the reform effort that local police are not given the option, and certainly not required, to participate in federal immigration enforcement. Toward that end, immigrant advocates should host informational meetings for their constituents to explain anti-immigrant legislation being proposed in their jurisdiction and how such legislative efforts will negatively impact immigrants. Immigrant advocates can provide the details about the partnership agreements between local police and federal authorities (such as 287(g) and Secure Communities) in spaces that those with anything short of citizenship status will feel safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An honest conversation about the dangers of contacting local police for any reason would acknowledge that a commitment to silence carries with it some real dangers as well. In jurisdictions where a refusal to report a crime carries criminal penalties, immigrant advocates could make their constituents aware of that fact and provide practical advice about how to protect themselves by maintaining silence in the event that the police are questioning them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the immigrant community has long been more vulnerable to crime, a public commitment to silence could have immediate consequences for that population. The fact that undocumented immigrants as a community are more vulnerable to crime is not a new development. In 2007, an article published in the Washington Post revealed that undocumented immigrants were being targeted for robberies so often that the practice had been given the unofficial name of &quot;amigo shopping.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If it became public knowledge that the immigrant community, as an organized group, would no longer contact the police, incidents of &quot;amigo shopping&quot; would surely increase. In our current, frighteningly anti-immigrant climate, the number of hate crimes committed against perceived immigrants may increase as a commitment to silence becomes public. Indeed, the hate-motivated incidents we have witnessed already may be a bellwether of what is to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 5, 2010, a twenty-six-year-old Mexican immigrant named Rodulfo Olmedo was attacked by four young men outside his apartment in the Port Richmond section of Staten Island, New York. His attackers &quot;yelled racial slurs at him, beat him with wooden planks, metal chains and a baseball &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*134]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bat, and took his money, leaving him with a fractured skull.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This attack followed closely on the heels of the nationally publicized murder of Marcelo Lucero, an Ecuadorean immigrant, who was stabbed to death by a White teenager in Patchogue, New York, in 2008. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant Jeffrey Conroy and six of his friends were found to have carried out a series of assaults on immigrants, which they called &quot;beaner-hopping,&quot; or &quot;Mexican-hopping.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Conroy was convicted of first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime, as well as attempted assaults on three other Hispanic men. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An organized commitment to silence undoubtedly comes fraught with additional dangers for an already vulnerable community, but history shows that the immigrant community will likely prefer these dangers over the danger of deportation. A look at the criminalization of immigrants in the employment context provides some insight into the difficult decision that undocumented immigrants must now make between matters of personal safety and discrimination versus deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1986, congressional enactment of the Immigration Reform and Control Act &quot;criminalized the employment relationship between an undocumented worker and an employer and signaled a new approach to immigration law enforcement, allowing border enforcement to permeate the workplace.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Lori A. Nessel argues that undocumented workers who assert their rights in the workplace are vulnerable to deportation because of the unwillingness of courts to recognize &quot;the punitive nature of deportation and the criminalization of immigration law.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not surprisingly, then, one study found that undocumented workers have an ever-present fear of deportation that inhibits them from formally confronting abusive employers or filing workplace protection claims. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet immigrants continue to constitute a significant segment of our labor force; indeed, one in nineteen civilian workers in the United States is undocumented. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undocumented immigrants are likely aware of the risks of silence. This Article seeks instead to explore the need to consider the benefits of organized silence as a way to meet the goals of those with less than full citizenship who wish to remain here and participate in all aspects of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*135]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. A Response to Advocates<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The recent surge in anti-immigrant legislation and partnership agreements has worsened the situation for the immigrant community. Instead of being asked to remain quiet so as not to further offend, or to remain frightened to even go outdoors, the immigrant community must be invited to choose silence as an informed, politicized objection to this unjust and increasingly hostile social and political climate. An organized withdrawal into silence by the immigrant community may be what is needed for advocates to truly gain some traction. This will show the American public and the legislators who represent them that our current strategies of targeting and deporting people from the country are dangerous as well as fiscally and socially irresponsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The millions of undocumented immigrants in this country make the prospect of their withdrawal into silence both awesome and fairly alarming. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that 11.2 million unauthorized immigrants were living in the United States as of March 2010. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A commitment to silence may not only be the best (or least undesirable) choice for undocumented immigrant witnesses to crime, it may also be best for all of the estimated twenty-two million people who are not yet naturalized citizens and who therefore remain subject to removal. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n61</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A commitment to silence from approximately thirty-three million people currently living in this country would surely impact the social and political backdrop of the immigration debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For immigrant advocates who are rightfully concerned about a withdrawal into silence by an already marginalized community, this Article presents two responses. First, it is an inescapable reality that the withdrawal into silence by the immigrant community is happening already. It is happening, however, in a sporadic and unorganized manner. The increasing number of local police deputized to enforce civil immigration violations through 287(g) agreements and the Secure Communities program has already led Latino communities to become distrustful of police and to underreport crimes as a result, making them even more vulnerable. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hispanic informants in 287(g) jurisdictions have told researchers that &quot;immigrants - legal and unauthorized - have increasingly developed fear and distrust of police.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there is no real way to quantify the impact that underreporting of crime is having on local communities when immigrants choose, on an individual and haphazard basis, not to report a crime simply to avoid &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*136]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  police contact. An organized, nationwide commitment to silence, on the other hand, may have the impact needed to truly engage in the conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, in response to the very real concern that urging an already marginalized and frequently targeted population to publicly endorse silence only makes it more vulnerable, I agree that it is a danger. However, unauthorized immigrants can no longer be expected to participate in local prosecutions of crimes they have witnessed, even if the person victimized was a family member or a friend, and not just a total stranger. The costs are simply too high: detention in a local jail for months at a time, or in an immigrant detention center without access to their families, solely because they had the misfortune to witness a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigrant advocates can focus their efforts not only on informing and organizing the immigrant community they serve, but also on informing the public of the very real consequences to local communities stemming from the cross-deputization of their police to enforce federal immigration laws. Three things should be made very clear. First, the increasingly punitive and unpredictable legal environment for undocumented people who find themselves involved in our criminal justice system as witnesses to local crimes is, and should be, discussed as a modern civil rights issue. Concerns about racial profiling of Latino residents, lengthy detentions without due process, and the steady deportation of people who have long-standing positive ties to their U.S. communities should be incorporated into the immigration discussion. Second, citizens should be made well aware of the negative social impact on local communities that partnerships with federal immigration agents can have. A significant segment of local communities will withdraw not only from participation in local law enforcement efforts, but also from other kinds of civic involvement such as owning and working in local businesses and spending the money they earn, which could prove to be financially and socially disastrous for local neighborhoods. Finally, while local partnerships with federal immigration officials undoubtedly assist the federal government in their goal of detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants as quickly and as efficiently as possible, the financial costs of these efforts could be devastating to local crime-fighting budgets. Local police would have to find space to detain those suspected of federal immigration violations, spend money setting up the partnership programs and training their officers, as well as reserve some money for litigation that is likely to follow from alleged civil rights violations from Latino residents who believe they have been the victims of racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following section details the 287(g) partnerships and the Secure Communities program, the criticisms that have been leveled against both programs by immigrant advocates and governmental agencies alike. Concerns that local enforcement of federal immigration law will lead immigrant communities to avoid the police, thereby making communities &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*137]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as a whole less safe, will be discussed in conjunction with concerns about racial profiling and the financial costs of such programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. 287(g) and Secure Communities: Encouraging Silence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. 287(g) Partnerships<BR>&nbsp;<BR> At the writing of this Article, state and local police in twenty-four states have entered into sixty-nine 287(g) partnerships with ICE as a way to expand local authority to enforce civil immigration violations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As of January 2010, over one thousand police officers had completed a four-week training program to better equip them to perform federal immigration enforcement functions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996 added Section 287(g) to the Immigration and Nationality Act. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It authorizes the Deputy Director of ICE to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies, allowing the law enforcement agencies to perform immigration enforcement functions under the training and supervision of ICE officers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 287(g) program had a slow start. The first agreement did not materialize until Florida participated in a pilot program in 2002. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the next four years, the Department of Homeland Security delegated the power to enforce immigration violations to six more jurisdictions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After 2006, however, there was substantial growth in the number of 287(g) partnerships, due in part to increased interest from the states in &quot;interior immigration enforcement&quot; and in part to an increase in federal funding for the program. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stated goal of the 287(g) program is to enhance public safety by &quot;removing criminal aliens who pose a threat&quot; to communities across the country. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The program attempts to achieve this goal by enabling local law enforcement to facilitate the deportation of &quot;foreign-born criminals and &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*138]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  immigration violators who pose a threat to national security or public safety.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Specifically, ICE states that the 287(g) program provides resources to local agencies to &quot;pursue investigations relating to violent crimes, human smuggling, gang/organized crime activity, sexual-related offenses, narcotics smuggling, and money laundering.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers of the 287(g) program, however, have raised serious questions about the efficacy of the program in achieving those goals, the state financial costs for taking on federal responsibilities with respect to undocumented residents, and the social consequences to communities should the police be racially profiling and detaining Latino residents. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A recent study conducted by the Latino Migration Project at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill examined the costs and consequences of the 287(g) program in North Carolina. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It found that traffic violations, rather than human smuggling or sex-offenses, were the most common charges for people incarcerated under the 287(g) program, representing 32.7 percent of the total charges. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same report found that the program was extremely costly, with direct expenditures - including start-up, daily operating, and maintenance costs for each program operated in a local or state jurisdiction - costing millions of dollars. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In estimating the costs of the 287(g) program in the rest of the country, the authors wrote, &quot;when indirect costs, such as litigation fees, are accounted for, the sixty-seven 287(g) intergovernmental partnerships currently operating around the country are costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, the report analyzed the effect of the 287(g) program on civil liberties in North Carolina and found evidence that the program enabled law enforcement officers to racially profile Hispanics in North Carolina. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report revealed that law enforcement officers &quot;pulled over Hispanic-appearing drivers &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*139]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under the pretense of a traffic infraction but with the intention of determining immigration status.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rogue jurisdictions that abuse the powers delegated to them through partnerships with federal immigration agents are and will continue to be a problem, as evidenced by Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Maricopa County, Arizona. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In October 2009, the federal government curbed the authority of the now infamous &quot;Sheriff Joe,&quot; limiting his powers to enforce immigration violations through his county's 287(g) agreement with DHS. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The change was spurred by an outcry over Sheriff Joe's extensive raids in Latino towns and neighborhoods, including accusations that his deputies were racially profiling Latino residents and making pretextual stops for the purpose of investigating suspected immigration violations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, decried Arpaio's &quot;reign of terror,&quot; referring to Arpaio's wide-ranging campaign against undocumented immigrants in Maricopa County. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following a Department of Justice investigation into reports of abuse by Arpaio's deputies, the Obama administration rescinded the authority of Arpaio's deputies to arrest suspected illegal immigrants in the streets as part of their local duties. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seemingly undeterred, Sheriff Joe responded aggressively, making the following statement on a local radio station:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>I don't need the feds to do my crime suppression to opt to arrest illegals. I can do it without the federal authority, and I'm going to continue to do it. It makes no difference. It helps us. Because I don't have to do all the paperwork for the feds, number one. And number two, I won't be under their umbrella, their guidance. So I will operate the same way, nothing is going to change ... . Nothing changes ... because pursuant to our duties in these crime suppression [sweeps] we arrest anybody that violates the law. If we find during the arrests that there are illegals, we arrest them. Now the only difference [is] we're going to take &quot;em down to ICE. I hope they accept them, if they don't, I'll bring &quot;em myself to the border. So nothing really has changed. This is all politics. They want to use me to get rid of this 287 agreement across the country ... I will do another crime suppression very soon to show Washington and everybody else I'm not changing, I will not be intimidated by Congress, by alleged racial profiling investigations by the Justice Department, by all &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*140]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  these demonstrators, these politicians, all trying to keep me from doing my job, so nothing will change. Stay tuned. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Part of what Sheriff Joe was railing about was a report critical of the 287(g) program issued by the Government Accountability Office in January 2009, stating that governmental controls needed to be strengthened. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among other things, the GAO found that &quot;over half of the 29 [participating police] agencies GAO contacted reported concerns from community members that use of program authority would lead to racial profiling and intimidation by law enforcement officials.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 2009, a top official at DHS testified before a House Committee that the 287(g) program lacked key internal controls stating:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Specifically, program objectives have not been documented in any program-related materials, guidance on how and when to use program authority is inconsistent, guidance on how ICE officials are to supervise officers from participating agencies has not been developed, data that participating agencies are to track and report to ICE has not been defined, and performance measures to track and evaluate progress toward meeting program objectives have not been developed. Taken together, the lack of internal controls makes it difficult for ICE to ensure that the program is operating as intended. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> In response to this criticism and the Sheriff Arpaio fall-out, the Obama administration rewrote all 287(g) partnership agreements with local police to step up ICE supervision and address complaints about racial profiling and civil rights violations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*141]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In March 2010, however, the Office of the Inspector General issued its report evaluating the progress of the federal government in effectively addressing and resolving these problems. The report found that &quot;civil rights and civil liberties considerations are not consistently weighed in the 287(g) review and selection process.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report further found that despite DHS having identified categories of aliens who are of top priority for arrest and removal - such as those with convictions for murder, rape, and major drug offenses - the overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants removed through the program had been convicted of much less serious offenses. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The findings led the authors of the report to conclude that &quot;these results do not show that 287(g) resources have been focused on aliens that pose the greatest risk to the public.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OIG report further noted that there were &quot;instances in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement and participating law enforcement agencies were not operating in compliance with the terms of the agreements[, and] several areas in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement had not instituted controls to promote effective program operations and address related risks.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report critically cited a participating law enforcement agency in the 287(g) program that &quot;is the subject of (1) an ongoing racial profiling lawsuit related to 287(g) program activities; (2) a lawsuit alleging physical abuse of a detained alien; and (3) a DOJ investigation into alleged discriminatory police practices, unconstitutional searches and seizures, and national origin discrimination.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All in all, the report issued thirty-three recommendations for ICE to improve management controls and address related risks to inconsistent program operations, thirty-two of which ICE agreed to. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Secure Communities<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The Secure Communities program, colloquially referred to as &quot;S-Comm,&quot; is now steadily making its way across the fifty states and the District of Columbia. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> S-Comm is equally rife with both fiscal and community safety concerns. S-Comm is a strategy developed by the ICE &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*142]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Agency to locate &quot;criminal aliens,&quot; or those noncitizens who pose a threat to public safety, so that they can be removed from the United States. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It requires that local police add ICE to the list of law enforcement agencies that they currently share biometric (fingerprint) information with once suspects are arrested for a crime and booked into local law enforcement custody. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ICE then compares that information to DHS immigration records. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If there is a match or if the named person does not appear in the database at all, ICE will make a determination about whether to issue a detainer on that particular inmate. The ICE detainer would result in the inmate's transfer from local custody to immigration custody once his local matter is resolved. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">S-Comm currently operates in 1,049 jurisdictions in thirty-nine states and is much like the 287(g) program in that it enlists state and local police as central participants in the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Every single person detained by the police will automatically have their fingerprints processed through immigration databases, &quot;even if their criminal charges are minor, eventually dismissed, or the result of an unlawful arrest.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internal government documents detailing the S-Comm program were recently obtained by the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), and the Kathryn O. Greenberg Immigration Justice Clinic of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law after they filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in New York Federal Court in April 2010. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Information contained in the documents provided support for the following claims:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>First, that ICE has been dishonest with the public and with local law enforcement regarding S-Comm's true mission and impact. While ICE markets S-Comm as an efficient, narrowly tailored tool that targets &quot;high threat&quot; immigrants, it actually functions as a dragnet for funneling people into the mismanaged ICE detention and removal system. ICE's own records &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*143]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  show that the vast majority (79 per cent) of people deported due to S-Comm are not criminals or were picked up for lower level offenses. Second, that the program serves as a smokescreen for racial profiling, allowing police officers to stop people based solely on their appearance and arrest non-citizens, knowing that they will be deported, even if they were wrongfully arrested and are never convicted. Preliminary data confirms that some jurisdictions, such as Maricopa County, Arizona, have abnormally high rates of non-criminal S-Comm deportations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Pablo Alvarado, the executive director of NDLON, stated that expansion of S-Comm means &quot;potential proliferation of racial profiling, distrust of local police, fear, and xenophobia.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such conditions will only fracture local communities by exacting social and financial costs that cannot be sustained by individual jurisdictions. Sunita Patel, an attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights, stated the issue bluntly: &quot;S-Comm co-opts local police departments to do ICE's dirty work at significant cost to community relations and police objectives.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Organized Silence as a Push to Concerned Police<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The thoughtful and carefully researched criticism of the 287(g) partnerships and the S-Comm program comes not just from immigrant advocates but from internal government oversight organizations as well. Despite this groundswell of criticism and warning from advocates and oversight agencies, S-Comm is spreading and local jurisdictions continue to sign up with federal immigration authorities through 287(g) partnerships. An organized commitment to silence by the immigrant community may be an immediate and powerful check to this mounting threat. Local police departments must be made aware that their mandate to protect the entire community from crime can be compromised by their own decision to also enforce federal immigration law. The safety concerns raised by these partnerships may not be fully appreciated by an American public that has long been frustrated by the federal government's failure to overhaul the immigration system. The financial burdens imposed upon local communities by these partnerships are underappreciated as well. The federal immigration agency is receiving a substantial benefit from partnering with local law enforcement agencies in various states, yet they may be unaware of - or worse, indifferent to - the toll that those partnerships exact on those individual local jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*144]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A growing number of police chiefs who are concerned about public safety in their individual jurisdictions have begun to make their criticisms of these federal partnerships known. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As these police chiefs take their concerns to Washington to speak directly to lawmakers and the American public, an organized commitment to silence by the immigrant community may lend a sense of urgency to such warnings from the police themselves. Should local police be made aware that a significant segment of the residents in their jurisdiction have decided not to call the police for any reason whatsoever, then they will see that their duties to protect and serve the entire community may be seriously compromised. The realization that the immigrant community has taken matters into its own hands by electing silence over reporting may spur the involvement of police who need the American public to appreciate the difficulties that will result from a commitment to silence by their neighbors, undocumented or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IV. Police Criticism of Local Immigration Enforcement<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The fact that local law enforcement and advocates for immigrants and low-income people agree on a particular issue is an unusual confluence of opinion. The two groups have different priorities and different perspectives: immigrant advocates see noncitizens as a vulnerable and targeted group, and through grassroots and legal advocacy they seek to improve the social and economic conditions of immigrants in this country. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But advocates are also rightfully concerned about the safety of an already-vulnerable immigrant community, not only from governmental abuse but also from street crime and workplace abuses. Police departments are also interested in arresting and prosecuting lawbreakers. Police departments can be diametrically opposed, however, to the goals of immigrant rights advocates as far as the question of whether local jurisdictions ought to participate in federal immigration enforcement. As can be seen by the growing number of partnerships between local police departments and federal immigration agents to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it is clear that many local police officials consider undocumented immigrants to be merely criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*145]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, an increasingly vocal contingent of police chiefs and sheriffs believe that their officers' involvement in federal immigration enforcement has had the adverse effect of making communities less safe, regardless of the fact that some immigrant residents may be in violation of federal immigration laws. This belief has created an unlikely meeting of the minds. Immigrant advocates in the difficult position of organizing their constituents to remain silent as an alternative to contacting local police certainly recognize that such efforts, while necessary, may leave an already-vulnerable community completely exposed. The strategic union of immigrant advocates who are concerned about the safety of the immigrant community, and like-minded police officials who are equally concerned about the safety of the entire community, has potential for tremendous success. This success, however, is dependent on how great the risk of police involvement in federal immigration enforcement actually is. Should the immigrant community make a public commitment to silence, effectively withdrawing from any participation in local policing efforts, a real sense of urgency will be added to the movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growing criticism of the 287(g) partnerships and the S-Comm program, combined with an actual commitment to silence from the immigrant community, can be capitalized upon to push sympathetic law enforcement to real action. The police can pressure the prosecutors they work with to come up with creative ways to protect undocumented immigrant witnesses to crime, and they can use their influence to pressure the federal government to expand the number of visas provided to immigrants who participate in the prosecution of real criminal wrongdoers. Local police should also be actively involved in educating an American public that may not listen to the concerns of partisan immigrant advocates, but will be receptive to police concerns that enlisting local police to participate in federal immigration enforcement actually endangers entire communities. Finally, police can take advantage of the federal government's own stated concerns about the permissible and desirable scope of state involvement in federal immigration enforcement expressed in the Justice Department's recent lawsuit challenging the validity of Arizona's anti-immigrant legislation, the infamous Senate Bill 1070. Police officials can build on this tension by pressuring the Obama administration for a redirection of energies, away from federal-state partnerships like 287(g) and S-Comm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A preliminary examination of Arizona's controversial Senate Bill 1070 and the Justice Department's lawsuit attempting to stop its implementation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> provides a helpful example of the federal government's own indecision about how much to ask the states for assistance in the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*146]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  immigration arena. It also reflects the Justice Department's own stated concerns that a patchwork system of state immigration enforcement would be &quot;counterproductive.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arizona Senate Bill 1070, signed by Governor Jan Brewer in April 2010, states specifically that its intent is to &quot;discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by [undocumented] persons&quot; in Arizona through a method called &quot;attrition through enforcement.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Simply put, the aim of the &quot;attrition through enforcement&quot; method is to make living and working in Arizona difficult (to say the least) for undocumented immigrants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the several mandates included in Senate Bill 1070 is the directive that local police decide whether &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; exists that a particular person is unlawfully present in the United States and if so, then to determine the immigration status of that person. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in federal court in July 2010, challenging Senate Bill 1070. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lawsuit alleged that &quot;S.B. 1070 unconstitutionally interferes with the federal government's authority to set and enforce immigration policy.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Justice Department explained that &quot;the Constitution and federal law do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The brief went on to state that Senate Bill 1070 would significantly burden federal agencies by diverting resources from high-priority targets like aliens implicated in terrorism, drug smuggling, and gang activity. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Additionally, the Justice Department complained that Arizona's law would result in &quot;the detention and harassment of authorized visitors, immigrants and citizens&quot; that cannot readily prove their lawful status. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Bill 1070 is the subject of several lawsuits filed by a number of advocacy organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders, and the League of United Latin American Citizens. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More surprising, however, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*147]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are the number of high-profile law enforcement officials that filed declarations in support of the Justice Department's lawsuit against Senate Bill 1070. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several law enforcement officials in Arizona, including the Chiefs of Police of Phoenix and Tucson, filed declarations in support of the Justice Department's lawsuit. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tucson Police Chief, Roberto Villasenor, raised both fiscal and community safety concerns with Senate Bill 1070. Chief Villasenor stated that laws like Senate Bill 1070 amount to &quot;an unfunded mandate that impose a Federal responsibility on local law enforcement,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> one his budget simply could not cover. He went on to state that requiring his officers to try and determine the immigration status of people in their community would jeopardize police relationships with the community, causing people to become more distrustful of the police. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Villasenor stated that it is difficult to determine what constitutes &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; regarding immigration status, and the likely result would be that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>each police agency in this state will therefore develop its own definition, no doubt resulting in a patchwork of policies and procedures, with obvious danger to both law enforcement agencies and their communities. The relationship between law enforcement agencies and their communities will be seriously strained. Many community leaders now believe that their constituents will be unfairly targeted in the eyes of law enforcement. The concern is not over persons illegally present, but rather with legal citizens of the United States, who may, they believe, experience unnecessary and prolonged police contact based on their appearance of national origin or ethnicity. They fear the legislation codifies racial profiling, despite its wording, and such fear could destroy the good relationships that currently exist between police and local communities that have taken years to build through our efforts in community policing. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris stated, &quot;I am very concerned that victims and witnesses will be afraid to call police for fear of deportation.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*148]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chief Harris referred to a recent incident in which an undocumented witness physically intervened to prevent a suspected child molester from fleeing before the police arrived. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Harris stated that had Senate Bill 1070 been in effect at that time, the witness may not have called for police for fear that his immigration status would result in his own detention. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arizona has become the epicenter for the national debate over the role that states can and should play in federal immigration enforcement. The federal lawsuit filed against Senate Bill 1070, following closely on the heels of the Obama administration's curbing of 287(g) authority from Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Maricopa County, Arizona, is one example of how the federal government itself is struggling with the fact that local enforcement of federal immigration law may be more trouble than it is worth. The critical reports from the Office of the Inspector General and the Latino Migration Report of the federal 287(g) program raise additional concerns about the capabilities of federal oversight and control over rogue states that have agendas of their own. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local law enforcement officials that are critical of the cross-deputization of local police to enforce federal immigration laws generally focus their objections on three likely outcomes: (1) that community safety will suffer as undocumented witnesses choose not to report crimes, (2) that cross-deputization of local police will result in their officers racially profiling Latino residents, and (3) that the financial burden on their local police budgets will be too great. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Community Safety Concerns<BR>&nbsp;<BR> On May 26, 2010, a group of police chiefs from across the country travelled to Washington D.C. to meet with Attorney General Eric Holder and voice their objections to Arizona's anti-immigrant law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck stated that Arizona's law would not increase public safety and would, in fact, &quot;make it much harder for us to do our jobs.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Beck went on to say that &quot;crime will go up if this becomes &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*149]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  law in Arizona or in any other state.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like other city residents, Chief Beck said, &quot;undocumented immigrants are witnesses in all kinds of crime, and this does not just affect them,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reflecting the reality that entire communities suffer when a significant segment of the population drops out of community crime reporting due to fear of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building relationships with an immigrant community that is already afraid of the police is challenging for local police departments, and the passage of Arizona's immigration law would, according to Chief Beck, &quot;increase the reluctance [to come forward] tenfold.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People who believe that contacting the police may lead to an inquiry into their own immigration status, or their family members' immigration status, will most certainly err on the side of caution and simply not make the call. Local police, who interact much more closely with their communities than any federal agent would, will find that their participation in federal immigration enforcement inevitably negatively affects those relationships on the street that are often crucial to timely and successful police investigations into local crime. Police departments across the country that have either experienced this drop in crime reporting firsthand from immigrant communities or have learned of its impact in other jurisdictions are rightfully concerned about the rise in state and federal cooperation agreements to police immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several members of the Consortium for Police Leadership in Equity in Denver, Colorado published a joint editorial in June 2010, titled Policing Immigration: A Job We Do Not Want. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n136</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They wrote:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>When legislators require state and local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration policy, they make it much harder for officers to do their job. Sheriffs and chiefs have long voiced their concerns that asking officers to be immigration agents will scare undocumented community members out of calling on law enforcement for help. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n137</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> This concern from local police departments that significant numbers of people will simply cease to rely on the police for help, or stop reporting crimes they have witnessed, has significant possibilities for informing the ongoing debate over state immigration enforcement. It simply cannot be denied that local police depend on their community members, documented and undocumented, to assist in solving crimes through &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*150]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cooperation with police and prosecutors. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n138</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The specter of an increase in unsolved crimes is one that police chiefs should be raising at community town hall meetings and with their local political representatives when a proposal to join federal cooperation programs such as 287(g) partnerships and Secure Communities is being publicly debated. The number of police organizations making their opposition to state immigration enforcement known is small, however, and they are in danger of having their voices drowned out by the police chiefs and local politicians across the country who are eagerly enlisting their communities to participate in federal immigration enforcement. Given their small numbers, police opponents to local policing of immigration violations must increase their efforts to change the hearts and minds of those within their own ranks. They must also take advantage of their position as law enforcement agents to influence a public that may be anti-immigrant, but is likely receptive to police concerns that local immigration enforcement will undermine the trust and cooperation necessary for effective policing of their neighborhoods, their streets, and their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This message about effective community policing was sounded years ago by the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCC), a group of police chiefs from the sixty-four largest police departments in the United States and Canada. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n139</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a position paper adopted in June 2006, the MCC raised police concerns about the negative impact that local immigration enforcement would have on police relationships with the immigrant community, stating,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>without assurances that contact with the police would not result in purely civil immigration enforcement action, the hard won trust, communication and cooperation from the immigrant community would disappear. Such a divide between the local police and immigrant groups would result in increased crime against immigrants and in the broader community, create a class of silent victims and eliminate the potential for assistance from immigrants in solving crimes or preventing future terroristic acts. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n140</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Members of the Committee who authored this position paper came from some of the largest police departments in the country, including Los &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*151]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Angeles, New York, Houston, Miami-Dade, and Tucson. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n141</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In warning that how local police responded to the call to enforce federal immigration laws could fundamentally change how those police protect and serve their local communities, MCC members were clearly hoping their message would reach other police departments considering an affirmative answer to that call. The renewed push for state cooperation in immigration enforcement through 287(g) partnerships and Secure Communities, however, has added a new sense of urgency to police concerns about the decline of police participation by the immigrant community, and organizations such as the MCC must be increasingly vocal in their opposition to these efforts if they hope to be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A more recent study carried out by the Consortium for Police Leadership in Equity (CPLE) in 2009 was meant to assist the Salt Lake City Police Department in evaluating the consequences of state legislation encouraging the practice of cross-deputizing police officers for the purpose of immigration enforcement. The study reveals that police departments continue to have valid concerns about their role in policing immigration. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n142</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Burbank, the Chief of Police in Salt Lake City, testified in Washington, D.C. before the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties about the results of the study, revealing that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>providing municipal police the powers of federal immigration agents is likely to discourage cooperation with law enforcement and encourage contempt and suspicion. The report indicates that when local law enforcement officers act as immigration agents, civilians become less convinced of their legitimacy. As a result, undocumented and documented Latinos, Latino citizens and White residents are less willing to report crimes when they occur. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n143</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Chief Burbank was able to provide specific examples, speaking about a client of Casa del Hispano in Lewisville, Texas who witnessed a murder &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*152]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but made no report of it to local police for several months for fear of deportation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n144</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police concerns that undocumented immigrant witnesses to crime have already and will continue to choose silence over reporting crimes to police are well founded. The problems that this poses for communities across the country cannot be overstated. Should immigrants choose silence over reporting crimes to police, prosecutions fall apart and police cannot effectively do their jobs. Police officials who appreciate the potential consequences of a significant segment of their communities choosing silence have voiced their concerns; now, they must support their words with action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police action to avoid a complete loss of contact with the immigrant communities in their jurisdictions must involve placing real pressure on local prosecutors and government officials to offer meaningful protection to immigrants who become involved in the criminal justice system through no fault of their own. Enlisting their colleagues in local law enforcement in these efforts to protect immigrants must necessarily climb to the federal level, because deportation proceedings are the purview of the federal immigration agency. Local law enforcement officials who wish to maintain contact with the immigrant community must also pressure the federal government for the expansion of witness visa programs if they wish to hold back the tide of more silent witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Racial Profiling Concerns<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The concern that state immigration enforcement will lead to the racial profiling of Latino members of their community is another problem that several police chiefs have identified as particularly troubling with regards to state policing of immigration violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 2010, the Consortium for Police Leadership in Equity convened a gathering in New York City to address issues of racial equity in law enforcement. It was a timely gathering of police leadership, sheriffs, researchers, federal officials and advocates in the aftermath of intense media coverage of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting, the Sean Bell shooting, and Arizona's Immigration Law (Senate Bill 1070). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n145</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nation's attention had turned toward the reality that racial tensions between law enforcement and the communities they police had increased, and the convention was meant to compel local police departments to address this problem with their communities in mind. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n146</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Efforts to have an honest and public &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*153]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conversation about the corrosive effects of racial profiling by police on any members of our communities must be made more often to a wide variety of audiences, and should be initiated by the police departments who know firsthand the detrimental effects racial profiling has on effective crime fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Burbank had addressed the problem of racial profiling in his testimony before Congress as well, reminding Congress of a not-so-ancient history when police served as agents of oppression during slavery and the civil rights era:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Police officers should enforce and uphold the law regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or national origin. The ideal that all people are created equal with certain unalienable rights is the basis upon which the United States of America was founded. However, we have labored with this notion from its inception over 230 years ago. Unfortunately, law enforcement has been an effective tool of oppression throughout the history of our nation. Biased laws and practices have forced officers to engage in institutional racism. Prior to 1865, officers and deputies were tasked with protecting the property rights of slave owners by patrolling for runaway slaves and even detaining free Black Americans if they failed to carry the proper documentation. Local law enforcement played a similar role during World War II, when a number of police agencies were required to enforce curfew and detain suspected &quot;enemy aliens,&quot; tantamount to the harassment and persecution of Japanese Americans. It was barely a generation ago that law enforcement was charged with keeping water fountains separate and high schools racially segregated. In these and countless other cases, legislators buoyed by public sentiment directed law enforcement to protect the predominant race against the contrived threat of others. We are still struggling to repair the mistrust, resentment and rage that many communities continue to feel. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n147</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> These words make it clear that local police departments, who are tasked with both enforcing local laws and upholding the United States Constitution, may find themselves in the untenable position of engaging in unconstitutional racial profiling through state immigration enforcement, while at the same time asking their community to continue to trust them. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n148</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*154]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In jurisdictions that have signed up to police immigration through programs like 287(g) and Secure Communities, immigrant advocates have been especially vocal in their protests about the racial profiling of residents by police. According to Rebecca Headen, staff attorney with the ACLU of North Carolina,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>the 287(g) program has created a climate of racial profiling and community fear throughout the state of North Carolina. Local law enforcement has established immigration checkpoints in areas frequented by Latinos including churches, flea markets, and trailer parks. Latinos have been arrested for improper vehicle tags, driving without a license, and fishing without a license. State troopers and local sheriffs' officers detained a bus with Latino passengers for hours for no reason other than the assertion they look foreign. Across North Carolina, Latinos now live under the constant threat that a trip to the grocery store or to Sunday worship could result in the deportation of their families. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n149</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> The &quot;face&quot; of illegal immigration today is undoubtedly Latino and/or Mexican, and this country cannot deny its regrettable history of racially profiling the disfavored minority of the moment. Police departments that do not wish to risk participating in such bigoted and constitutionally offensive practices again, now with a new target, must seriously evaluate the impact that state immigration enforcement has on their own internal policies about racial profiling and discrimination. Collaborating with immigrant rights organizations, as well as members of historically disenfranchised groups who have experienced the detrimental effects of racial profiling in their own communities, should be a priority of local police departments considering a move into state immigration enforcement. African Americans who have experienced the same kind of profiling that Latinos and Mexicans face today can be influential voices of support as well as powerful reminders of the discrimination that the police have exposed marginalized groups to in the past. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n150</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*155]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Budgetary Pressures<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The cost of state immigration enforcement on local police departments is one that must be considered at a time of fiscal austerity on all fronts. On July 1, 2010, President Obama spoke at American University School of International Service on the subject of immigration reform and specifically addressed the budgetary pressures that state immigration enforcement can impose:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Laws like Arizona's put huge pressures on local law enforcement to enforce rules that ultimately are unenforceable. It puts pressure on already hard-strapped state and local budgets. It makes it difficult for people here illegally to report crimes - driving a wedge between communities and law enforcement, making our streets more dangerous and the jobs of our police officers more difficult. And you don't have to take my word for this. You can speak to the police chiefs and others from law enforcement here today who will tell you the same thing. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n151</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Sheriff Bill Pribil of Coconino County, Arizona commented on the proposed anti-immigration bills in his state in March of 2010, stating, &quot;at this point, I see it interesting on the one hand [that] counties are being eviscerated by the state Legislature when it comes to budget ... and yet they continue to find ways for us to spend our precious resources on programs we can't support.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n152</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sheriff Pribil added that &quot;this is just one more unfunded mandate that is being put onto counties ... and now we're being asked to put another layer of duties onto law enforcement that we cannot support.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n153</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada Sheriff Mike Haley stated,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Any unfunded mandate, any direction by the federal government, that I use my precious resources to affect a federal outcome would affect my ability to do what the taxpayers in my county have asked me to do, and that is to keep them safe from criminals. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n154</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*156]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill study discussed earlier, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n155</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> researchers found support for police officials' budgetary concerns about state immigration enforcement. The study found that in Prince William County, Virginia, the estimated cost of the 287(g) program is $ 6.4 million annually and $ 25.9 million for five years. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n156</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Researchers found that the initial costs of the Prince William County program had been higher than anticipated, so the Board of Commissioners had to raise property taxes by 5 percent and reduce funds reserved for police and fire services. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n157</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>the annual direct and indirect costs of the 287(g) program in the state of Arkansas were an estimated $ 7.9 million. These costs include training for twenty-one officers, incarceration, transportation, foster care for children of arrestees, police education campaigns, litigation and legal liability, and increases in wages and prices due to less labor from unauthorized immigrants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n158</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> The report concluded that the cost of direct expenditures alone, which included start-up, daily operating, and maintenance costs of the 287(g) program in a local or state jurisdiction, would be in the millions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n159</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The researchers accounted for indirect costs as well, such as litigation fees, and found that the sixty-seven 287(g) partnerships currently in operation across the country are costing the American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c25"><SUP>n160</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police are right to be concerned about their local crime-fighting budgets. In these difficult economic times, everyone is concerned with how resources are being allocated. If programs like 287(g) and Secure Communities require local police to acquire new duties and responsibilities without the necessary financial assistance from the federal agency that is enlisting them, then the police should actively object. Local police departments that cannot afford an unfunded mandate to enforce federal immigration violations cannot be satisfied simply stating their objections; they must act to prevent such a mandate from being imposed upon them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police have valid concerns and objections to the involvement of local police departments in federal immigration enforcement. Police efforts to educate their own members, politicians, and the American public about the dangers outlined above can be redoubled through collaboration with &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*157]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  immigrant advocacy organizations. In the meantime, the immigrant population must act to protect itself in an era when local police and federal immigration agents are equally menacing forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCLUSION<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The cost for undocumented immigrant witnesses to report crime in this country today has grown too high. In the face of an increasingly intertwined state and federal immigration enforcement regime, the possibility that a report to police may lead to questions about immigration status will lead the rational undocumented witness to choose silence over calling the police. Examples like that of Abel Moreno in North Carolina, detained because of his lack of legal status after reporting an alleged sexual assault to police, have wide-ranging consequences for local communities should the immigrant community decide that next time, they will simply remain silent. The plight of the six men in Louisiana who witnessed the murder of their friend and then spent several months in jail because of the possibility that they might be deported before they could testify sent a loud and clear message to the immigrant community: If you value your job, your home, and any ties you have to this country, then the police are to be avoided at all costs by those without proper legal documentation to live here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A collective movement to endorse silence as an organized act of civil disobedience should be encouraged throughout the immigrant community for those residents with anything less than full citizenship status. As an organized group of some thirty-three million strong who commit to silence in the form of a complete refusal to contact local police for any reason whatsoever, willful silence will be a potent mechanism for radical social change in a political and social climate that demonizes immigrants. Immigrant advocates can play a central role in organizing a widespread commitment to silence from immigrant communities while still acknowledging the ramifications of such a commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increasing number of federal immigration enforcement programs that enlist local police to identify possible immigration violations has only worsened the situation for immigrants. In a growing number of jurisdictions, the police are rightfully perceived to be anti-immigrant and eager to prioritize federal immigration enforcement over local policing objectives. The police community has grown divided, however, over the appropriate role of local police in federal immigration enforcement. A growing number of law enforcement officials believe that the costs to community safety, community relations, and local budgets are too high. These police officials are voicing their criticisms and concerns, emphasizing the potential dangers of a situation where the immigrant community declines to contact law enforcement to report crime for fear that their immigration status will be revealed. Indeed, police recognize that it is &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*158]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  already happening, albeit in a haphazard fashion. A public commitment to silence by the immigrant community, as a chosen tactic of civil disobedience, would make these fears not just a vague possibility, but an immediate threat. While a commitment to silence is certainly not what any police officer, sympathetic or not, desires, such a commitment would contribute a sense of urgency to what is currently merely a discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By some estimates there are approximately 11.2 million undocumented persons currently in the United States and some twenty-two million with something less than full citizenship status. A commitment to silence on this scale takes the problem out of the realm of debate over immigration reform and into concerns about police and community involvement in the safety and fair treatment of community members, regardless of citizenship status. A public commitment to silence of this magnitude would give immigrants the ability to demand a solution that would meet the needs of vulnerable witnesses as well as law enforcement authorities and the communities that they protect.</SPAN></P>

Ms. Cote's immigration lawyer, John Barry, stated that given the high-publicity generated by the case and the fact that the ACLU has filed a lawsuit on her behalf, in addition to the fact that Ms. Cote's husband is a combat veteran, may result in her receiving &quot;parole status&quot; and avoiding deportation. Barry went on to say that other immigrants in similar situations may not be as lucky, particularly as programs such as Secure Communities and 287(g) expand ICE's reach. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters won't be asked to approve a tax to replace aging train cars until at least 2013, BART board members say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transit agency had been considering a ballot measure for as early as November 2012 to ask voters in three counties to approve a parcel tax to raise about $651 million for the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A public transit pioneer when it opened in 1972, BART says its cars are wearing out and will break down and delay service unless replaced within a few years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now board members say the 2012 election will be too early and too crowded with other tax or bond measures that could weaken support for a BART tax. It would require two-thirds approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's too early,&quot; said BART Board President Bob Franklin of Oakland. &quot;We need more time to make our case to voters and explain the importance of replacing our cars. Our fleet is the oldest in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poll of BART voters taken in spring suggests a parcel tax would have trouble winning in the three BART counties of Alameda, Contra Costa and San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While about 65 percent of those surveyed expressed general support for the idea of a ballot measure for train cars, support slipped below 40 percent for a parcel tax of $45 per home per year, BART officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll results were presented to the board in a retreat Nov. 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's black and white. We don't have the votes,&quot; said BART Director Robert Raburn of Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaining two-thirds support for a BART tax on the 2012 ballot would be even tougher because Alameda County leaders plan then to seek approval to renew a county sales tax for transportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it would muddy things to have two measures on the same ballot,&quot; said BART Director John McPartland of Castro Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Board members Joel Keller and Gail Murray agreed, and said they favor a later date -- perhaps 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alameda County's transportation sales tax will be aimed at paying for both roads and pubic transit, but there is a proposal to devote some $400 million of the proceeds to a BART rail extension to Livermore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Struggling to offset budget cuts in hard times, several school districts, cities and local agencies may put tax or fee measures on the 2012 ballot, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Franklin said postponing a BART tax measure also would give the agency more time to rebuild credibility after several police controversies in the last three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've taken some hits,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to rebuild public trust.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the most publicized event, a BART transit police officer was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for shooting to death an unarmed passenger, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III, on New Year's Day 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART estimates that replacing its 669 trains will cost around $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion, but state and federal grants will cover most of the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first car order could be funded by grants but BART needs to have a parcel tax passed before April 2017 to provide a commitment of local funds for the second and biggest train car order, transit managers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keller of the BART board said the agency shouldn't wait until the last minute to go before voters in case the measure loses and a second ballot attempt is needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BART board is scheduled in April to award the contract to design and build the first 200 or so new cars. Competition for the car manufacturing job has been narrowed to three large international outfits: Alstom Transport, Bombardier and Hyundai/Rotem.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters won't be asked to approve a tax to replace aging train cars until at least 2013, BART board members say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transit agency had been considering a ballot measure for as early as November 2012 to ask voters in three counties to approve a parcel tax to raise about $651 million for the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A public transit pioneer when it opened in 1972, BART says its cars are wearing out and will break down and delay service unless replaced within a few years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now board members say the 2012 election will be too early and too crowded with other tax or bond measures that could weaken support for a BART tax. It would require two-thirds approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's too early,&quot; said BART Board President Bob Franklin of Oakland. &quot;We need more time to make our case to voters and explain the importance of replacing our cars. Our fleet is the oldest in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poll of BART voters taken in spring suggests a parcel tax would have trouble winning in the three BART counties of Alameda, Contra Costa and San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While about 65 percent of those surveyed expressed general support for the idea of a ballot measure for train cars, support slipped below 40 percent for a parcel tax of $45 per home per year, BART officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll results were presented to the board in a retreat Nov. 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's black and white. We don't have the votes,&quot; said BART Director Robert Raburn of Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaining two-thirds support for a BART tax on the 2012 ballot would be even tougher because Alameda County leaders plan then to seek approval to renew a county sales tax for transportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it would muddy things to have two measures on the same ballot,&quot; said BART Director John McPartland of Castro Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Board members Joel Keller and Gail Murray agreed, and said they favor a later date -- perhaps 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alameda County's transportation sales tax will be aimed at paying for both roads and pubic transit, but there is a proposal to devote some $400 million of the proceeds to a BART rail extension to Livermore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Struggling to offset budget cuts in hard times, several school districts, cities and local agencies may put tax or fee measures on the 2012 ballot, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Franklin said postponing a BART tax measure also would give the agency more time to rebuild credibility after several police controversies in the last three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've taken some hits,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to rebuild public trust.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the most publicized event, a BART transit police officer was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for shooting to death an unarmed passenger, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III, on New Year's Day 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART estimates that replacing its 669 trains will cost around $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion, but state and federal grants will cover most of the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first car order could be funded by grants but BART needs to have a parcel tax passed before April 2017 to provide a commitment of local funds for the second and biggest train car order, transit managers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keller of the BART board said the agency shouldn't wait until the last minute to go before voters in case the measure loses and a second ballot attempt is needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BART board is scheduled in April to award the contract to design and build the first 200 or so new cars. Competition for the car manufacturing job has been narrowed to three large international outfits: Alstom Transport, Bombardier and Hyundai/Rotem.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veterans and others have concluded their Veterans Day march from Frank H. Ogawa Plaza to the police station and have returned to the Occupy Oakland camp. Earlier, police distributed eviction notices to campers at Occupy Oakland. The move comes one day after a man -- whose name has not been released by police -- was shot and killed after an apparent fight near the Occupy Oakland tent city. The mayor and other city leaders are stepping up calls for the camp to disband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10:30 p.m. Camp beds down</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Occupy Oakland is bedding down for the night. Small groups of occupiers are milling around, talking quietly, while a homeless man sleeps in the doorway of City Hall. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A slow drizzle has again started to fall over downtown Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9:45 p.m. Sockupy Oakland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man named Michael Haley is handing out free socks at the Occupy encampment, saying he is running Sockupy Oakland. Dry feet, he says, are the key to getting people to defy Quan's request to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has a website, www.sockupyoakland.org , where he is accepting donations to buy more socks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He started the effort in honor of his mother, who was an activist in the '60s who wanted to join the Occupy Oakland movement, he wrote on the site. &quot; ... but I wouldn't let her go face the riot cops,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I'll do that for her for now, thanks. So, when she asked, 'Well what CAN I do?' I said socks. Socks were the number one request of campers who a friend and I talked to on our various tours of OGP. Even Forrest Gump knows to take care of your feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's more: &quot;The socks I can currently get (Champion brand white medium socks) are $12.99/dozen. I will buy Ziploc sandwich bags, packaging one pair in each bag (which is then a waterproof bag containing emergency socks for when it rains, if their feet are currently dry), with a small piece of paper detailing how these socks were provided (no names). I will then take these packaged socks and verify first hand that the people I give them to are part of an actual tent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I feel that this is important because this seems to be one of the most asked for items by actual occupiers; nobody thought to bring 20 pairs of socks, which is what you legitimately need in this situation of sustained outdoors living. It is important both for the hygiene and the health of these protesters, but also -- most importantly -- for their morale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9:10 p.m. Calm night at the camp</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Very little action at the tent city for now, although one camper is upset to find his tent missing. It's unclear at this point where it went.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lone person playing a recorder is entertaining the campers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8:30 p.m. Campers destroy eviction notices</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every last one of the 200 eviction notices handed out earlier have been destroyed by angry campers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is the full text of the notice:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Persons staying overnight in Frank Ogawa Plaza</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Date: November 11, 2011</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notice of violations and demand to cease violations. This notice supersedes all previous notices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City of Oakland and its police department support and protect the right of all individuals to engage in free speech and their right to assemble. However, this encampment is a violation of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You do not have permission to lodge overnight in Frank Ogawa Plaza. You must remove all tents, sleeping bags, tarps, cooking facilities and equipment and any other lodging material from the Plaza immediately. Your continued use of the Plaza for overnight lodging will subject you to arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your activities are injurious to health, obstruct the free use of property, interfering with the comfortable enjoyment of the Plaza, and unlawfully obstruct the free passage or use of a public park or square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(California Penal Code sections 370 and 647(e) and Civil Code section 3479.) You must allow all persons, including Oakland Police officers and other emergency personnel, access to all areas of the Plaza at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You are making fires in a public park in violation of OMC 12.64.160. You must remove all barbecues and stoves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your continued violation of these laws will subject you to administrative penalties, civil penalties, citation, and immediate arrest. Your continued violation of the law will subject your tents, stoves, sleeping bags, tarps, and any other belongings left in the plaza to immediate removal from the plaza by the city of Oakland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Friday, a group has sent a message on Twitter that they want to make it a &quot;Night of 1,000 masks&quot; and is urging people to show up at 9 p.m. at the camp. One person has been spotted with a mask.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7:45 p.m. Shooting suspect had been living in camp, police say</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the men being sought in connection with Thursday's shooting death near Frank Ogawa Plaza was a frequent resident of the camp, Oakland police said in a newly issued news release. Occupiers have said the shooting was unrelated to the camp. Here's the full text of the OPD release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Nov. 10, 2011, at 4:57 p.m., the Oakland Police Department responded to the 1400 block of Broadway on a report of a shooting. When officers arrived on scene, they located a male adult African American victim believed to be in his 20s, who was suffering from a gunshot wound. The victim was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland Police Department Major Crimes Section Investigators were called to the scene. The identity of the victim is being withheld pending the notification of next of kin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland Police Department Major Crimes Section investigators report that witnesses state the suspect was a frequent resident at the Frank Ogawa Plaza for the past several days. He is described as a male African-American, 20-25 years old, 5'9,&quot; 150 lbs, with short hair. He was wearing a white T-shirt. A second suspect is described as a male African American, in his 20s to 30s, 5'9&quot; to 5'11,&quot; 250 lbs, long dreadlocks with red tips, possibly with a tattoo on the back of his neck. He was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oakland Police Department and Crime Stoppers of Oakland are offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is asked to contact the Oakland Police Department Major Crimes, Section 1, Team 3, at 510-238-3529.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7:40 p.m. Tent city is upset over eviction notices</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After marching from Frank H. Ogawa Plaza to the Oakland Police Department Friday night, many campers have returned to the plaza. Campers are upset about the earlier eviction notices handed out by police and are saying, &quot;Read it and burn it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6 p.m. Mayor: Occupy Oakland 'risks are too great'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campers are wadding up and tossing out the eviction notices they were served earlier, while Mayor Jean Quan defended issuing the notices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quan issued a statement saying, &quot;Last night's tragic incident on the plaza has elevated concerns about the safety of the encampment and people who also use the space. The risks are too great and it is time for the encampment to end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also five other emergency calls for service in the area Thursday, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One call, at 3:23 p.m., was about a pedestrian who was hit by a vehicle at 14th Street and Broadway. The incident appeared to be unrelated to the Occupy Oakland incident. A young man was being pursued by downtown security and ran in front of a car and was hit. He sustained minor injuries and was transported by paramedics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 5:08 p.m., emergency crews responded to 15th Street and Broadway for a pedestrian that was hit by an OPD squad car that appeared to be responding to the shooting. The man who was hit had nonlife threatening injuries and was treated by paramedics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 30 minutes later, emergency personnel responded to 140 Frank Ogawa Plaza for a female working at the Western Federal Credit Union, who said that a stray bullet that killed a man earlier had broken the window of her office and that she was &quot;nearly grazed&quot; by the bullet and hit with broken glass. She had superficial injuries, but refused to be transported for medical treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 9:12 p.m., fire crews were back at the scene of the earlier shooting to wash down blood and vomit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 4 a.m. Friday, emergency crews were called to the Occupy Oakland medical tent for a 20-year-old man who had signs consistent with alcohol and/or drug use. The patient was transported to an area hospital by paramedics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quan's statement also said electrical power boxes for outside lights on the plaza have been forced open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a vocal, but peaceful march of veterans against police brutality has returned to the plaza after marching to the police department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5:25 p.m. Occupy Oakland gets eviction notices</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As rain continues to beat on the tents at Occupy Oakland, police are going tent to tent distributing eviction notices to campers directing them to leave or be arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notice reads &quot;Attention persons staying overnight in Ogawa Plaza Nov. 11. Notice of violations and demand to cease violation. This notice supersede all previous notices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter says, &quot;Your continued use of the plaza for overnight lodging will subject you to arrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter cites public health laws, such as making fires in a city park, that campers are breaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your continued violation of the law will subject your tents, sleeping bags, tarps and any other belonging left in the plaza to immediate removal from the park,&quot; the document continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Council President Larry Reid said Friday night that he has not been informed of the timing of any enforcement of the orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a few hundred people are marching in downtown and chanting, &quot;Stop beating veterans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two vets have been injured over the last month in clashes with police over the Occupy Oakland movement, witnesses have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4:45 p.m. Friends say Scott Olsen discharged from hospital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends gathered at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza say Scott Olsen, the 24-year-old military vet who witnesses say was hit in the head with a tear-gas canister on the night of Oct. 25, is out of the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olsen fractured his skull when police and protesters clashed the night after the Occupy Oakland camp was torn down by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking at the rally is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> uncle, Cephus Johnson, also a veteran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4:35 p.m. Veterans speaking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 30 veterans are gathering at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza ready to lead a march, likely to the Oakland Police Department to denounce violence against vets. The group is giving condolences to families of vets who have committed suicide after returning from war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hundred people have gathered in the plaza, waiting to participate in the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3:55 p.m. Waiting for Veterans Day march to start</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men in green military jackets and military headgear have begun gathering on the plaza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veterans For Peace is preparing to making a speech and possibly give condition updates on Scott Olsen, the 24-year-old Daly City man and Iraq War veteran who witnesses say was shot in the head with a tear-gas canister during a clash with police and protesters on Oct. 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As people gather on the plaza under a break from Friday's rainy weather, a sign has been placed inside a bus shelter on 14th Street. It reads: &quot;Occupiers, turn on your brains and see the harm you are causing to our town. You are attracting criminals, hurting our fragile economy, trashing public space. You have devolved into mob rule. You have lost sight of the goal. Leave now. Don't not violate my right of free speech, do not take down this flier. Citizen of Oakland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the sign, someone has scrawled, &quot;Citizen, see the harm that capitalism causes to our country!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12:50 p.m. Richmond mayor skips veterans event for Occupy rally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 100 protesters gathered in front of Richmond City Hall this morning for an Occupy &quot;speak out&quot; addressing wealth inequality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers called the rally for 11 a.m., the hour traditionally reserved for Veterans Day remembrances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Gayle McLaughlin came under criticism from local veterans groups and the conservative cable channel Fox News for skipping a Chevron-sponsored salute to veterans scheduled for the same hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Occupy organizers said they chose the date and time because they wanted families to be able to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One &quot;speak out&quot; attendee called a moment of silence for veterans and another noted that veterans are among those victimized by corporate greed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry Clark of the environmentalist West County Toxics Coalition said that Richmond residents are veterans of the battle for social justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are veterans of Chevron, veterans of the Occupy Richmond struggle, he said. &quot;We are all on the battlefield.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor McLaughlin said that the Occupy movement is important to Richmond residents grappling with unemployment, foreclosures and generational poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As mayor, I understand the frustration of the people as the wealth becomes concentrated with the 1 percent,&quot; she said. &quot;This isn't what veterans fought for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics this week said the mayor should have reserved the hour for honoring veterans alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Council members Jeff Ritterman and Jovanka Beckles also attended the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11 a.m. Cal mostly unoccupied</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Occupy Cal protest has dwindled to two protesters, seated on the steps of Sproul Hall this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifteen people spent the night outside Sproul Hall without tents last night, said UC Berkeley student Katie Rapp, 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm cold and tired,&quot; said Rapp, adding the plan is bring back tents on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9:05 a.m. Police union sends open letter to Occupy Oakland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the Oakland Police Officers Association sent a letter to the Occupy Oakland camp, imploring them to leave peacefully. Monitoring the camp, especially its violent elements, has become a drain on city resources, according to the OPOA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is the full text of the letter:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On behalf of the 645 Oakland police officers we represent, this letter comes to you out of duty to protect the Oakland community and its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police officers are the 99 percent and we understand and sympathize with your message. We respect your right to peaceful protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are also sworn to protect the citizens of Oakland. Right now, Oakland is in a state of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our police officers are the 99 percent struggling in Oakland neighborhoods every day to contain the 1 percent who rob, steal, rape and murder our law-abiding citizens. The Occupy Oakland protest, now 30 days old, is taking our police officers out of Oakland neighborhoods and away from protecting the citizens of Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an average city in California, this might not be of emergency proportions for its citizens. Oakland is not an 'average' city -- we have the highest violent crime rate in California. We are the fifth most violent city in the United States, with more shootings and homicides than any city west of the Mississippi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night's murder, right in the epicenter of Occupy Oakland, is unacceptable. So is the violence being promoted by 'renegade' protesters who are lighting firebombs, destroying property and attacking police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is even more tragic is that homicides are a frequent occurrence in Oakland. This is the real emergency: Yesterday's murder was Oakland's 101st homicide of 2011. It is time for us to stop directing all of our efforts at policing the small enclave of 'Occupy Oakland' and get back to our job of protecting the citizens of Oakland in the neighborhoods where our residents live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events of recent weeks have shown that many occupiers at Frank Ogawa Plaza are citizens of other communities with limited interest in preserving the greater good and safety of our city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please, we ask you: Leave Frank Ogawa Plaza peacefully and immediately so Oakland police can get back to work fighting the devastating crime that's occurring in our neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You have sent the world a strong message; now it is time to go home. Your leaving today, peacefully, of your own free will, on the 30th day, will send a message to Oakland that you care about our citizens and respect our city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With last night's homicide, in broad daylight, in the middle of rush hour, Frank Ogawa Plaza is no longer safe. Please leave peacefully, with your heads held high, so we can get police officers back to work fighting crime in Oakland neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7:40 a.m. Tense scene after confrontation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the last 20 minutes, a fight broke out after two men apparently tried to set a tent on fire. A man who witnessed it confronted them and followed them with a video camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They told the man, apparently a camper, to mind his own business, scuffled with him and swung a hammer and baton they had with them. The man's video camera was smashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police officers watched the scuffle and started yelling at the men, but by that time other campers had joined and told them it was under control.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In honor of Veterans Day, a group of veterans and their supporters are meeting at Frank H. Ogawa in preparation for speeches and a march through downtown. The event comes just one day after a man -- whose name has not been released by police -- was shot and killed after an apparent fight near the Occupy Oakland tent city. The mayor and other city leaders are stepping up calls for the camp to disband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5:10 p.m. Police distributing eviction notices at Occupy Oakland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the pouring rain, police are distributing eviction notices to campers at Occupy Oakland asking them to leave or be arrested. Meanwhile, a few hundred people are marching against traffic north on Broadway, likely toward the Oakland Police Department. They are chanting, &quot;Stop beating veterans.&quot; Two vets have been injured over the last month in clashes with police over the Occupy Oakland movement, witnesses have said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4:45 p.m. Friends say Scott Olsen discharged from hospital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends gathered at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza say Scott Olsen, the 24-year-old military vet who witnesses say was hit in the head with a tear-gas canister on the night of Oct. 25, is out of the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olsen fractured his skull when police and protesters clashed the night after the Occupy Oakland camp was torn down by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking at the rally is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> uncle, Cephus Johnson, also a veteran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4:35 p.m. Veterans speaking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 30 veterans are gathering at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza ready to lead a march, likely to the Oakland Police Department to denounce violence against vets. The group is giving condolences to families of vets who have committed suicide after returning from war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hundred people have gathered in the plaza, waiting to participate in the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3:55 p.m. Waiting for Veterans Day march to start</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men in green military jackets and military head wear have begun gathering on the plaza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veterans For Peace is preparing to making a speech and possibly give condition updates on Scott Olsen, the 24-year-old Daly City man and Iraq War veteran who witnesses say was shot in the head with a tear-gas canister during a clash with police and protesters on Oct. 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As people gather on the plaza under a break from Friday's rainy weather, a sign has been placed inside a bus shelter on 14th Street. It reads: &quot;Occupiers, turn on your brains and see the harm you are causing to our town. You are attracting criminals, hurting our fragile economy, trashing public space. You have devolved into mob rule. You have lost sight of the goal. Leave now. Don't not violate my right of free speech, do not take down this flier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Citizen of Oakland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the sign someone, has scrawled &quot;Citizen, see the harm that capitalism causes to our country!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12:50 p.m. Richmond mayor skips veterans event for Occupy rally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 100 protesters gathered in front of Richmond City Hall this morning for an Occupy &quot;speak out&quot; addressing wealth inequality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers called the rally for 11 a.m., the hour traditionally reserved for Veterans Day remembrances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Gayle McLaughlin came under criticism from local veterans groups and the conservative cable channel Fox News for skipping a Chevron-sponsored salute to veterans scheduled for the same hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Occupy organizers said they chose the date and time because they wanted families to be able to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One &quot;speak out&quot; attendee called a moment of silence for veterans and another noted that veterans are among those victimized by corporate greed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry Clark of the environmentalist West County Toxics Coalition said that Richmond residents are veterans of the battle for social justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are veterans of Chevron, veterans of the Occupy Richmond struggle, he said. &quot;We are all on the battlefield.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor McLaughlin said that the Occupy movement is important to Richmond residents grappling with unemployment, foreclosures and generational poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As mayor, I understand the frustration of the people as the wealth becomes concentrated with the 1 percent,&quot; she said. &quot;This isn't what veterans fought for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics this week said the mayor should have reserved the hour for honoring veterans alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Council members Jeff Ritterman and Jovanka Beckles also attended the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11 a.m. Cal mostly unoccupied</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Occupy Cal protest has dwindled to two protesters, seated on the steps of Sproul Hall this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifteen people spent the night outside Sproul Hall without tents last night, said UC Berkeley student Katie Rapp, 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm cold and tired,&quot; said Rapp, adding the plan is bring back tents on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9:05 a.m. Police union sends open letter to Occupy Oakland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the Oakland Police Officers Association sent a letter to the Occupy Oakland camp, imploring them to leave peacefully. Monitoring the camp, especially its violent elements, has become a drain on city resources, according to the OPOA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is the full text of the letter:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On behalf of the 645 Oakland police officers we represent, this letter comes to you out of duty to protect the Oakland community and its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police officers are the 99% and we understand and sympathize with your message. We respect your right to peaceful protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are also sworn to protect the citizens of Oakland. Right now, Oakland is in a state of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our police officers are the 99% struggling in Oakland neighborhoods every day to contain the 1% who rob, steal, rape and murder our law-abiding citizens. The Occupy Oakland protest, now 30 days old, is taking our police officers out of Oakland neighborhoods and away from protecting the citizens of Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an average city in California, this might not be of emergency proportions for its citizens. Oakland is not an &quot;average&quot; city   we have the highest violent crime rate in California. We are the 5th most violent city in the United States   with more shootings and homicides than any city west of the Mississippi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night's murder, right in the epicenter of Occupy Oakland, is unacceptable. So is the violence being promoted by &quot;renegade&quot; protesters who are lighting firebombs, destroying property and attacking police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is even more tragic is that homicides are a frequent occurrence in Oakland. This is the real emergency: Yesterday's murder was Oakland's 101st homicide of 2011. It is time for us to stop directing all of our efforts at policing the small enclave of &quot;Occupy Oakland&quot; and get back to our job of protecting the citizens of Oakland in the neighborhoods where our residents live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events of recent weeks have shown that many occupiers at Frank Ogawa Plaza are citizens of other communities with limited interest in preserving the greater good and safety of our City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please, we ask you: Leave Frank Ogawa Plaza peacefully and immediately so Oakland Police can get back to work fighting the devastating crime that's occurring in our neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You have sent the world a strong message; now it is time to go home. Your leaving today, peacefully, of your own free will, on the 30th day, will send a message to Oakland that you care about our citizens and respect our city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With last night's homicide, in broad daylight, in the middle of rush hour, Frank Ogawa Plaza is no longer safe. Please leave peacefully, with your heads held high, so we can get police officers back to work fighting crime in Oakland neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7:40 a.m. Tense scene after confrontation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the last 20 minutes, a fight broke out after two men apparently tried to set a tent on fire. A man who witnessed it confronted them and followed them with a video camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They told the man, apparently a camper, to mind his own business, scuffled with him and swung a hammer and baton they had with them. The man's video camera was smashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police officers watched the scuffle and started yelling at the men, but by that time other campers had joined and told them it was under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men with the hammer and baton took off without further confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday, 6:30 a.m. Shrine erected to 'Alex'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A shrine has been erected near the spot where a man was shot and killed the previous night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials have not yet released the man's name, pending notification of next of kin, and are only saying that he may have been in his 20s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shrine, however, names him as &quot;Alex&quot;. Lit by about 100 candles, it carries messages pinned to poster board that say &quot;We love you Alex,&quot; &quot;You will not be forgotten,&quot; and &quot;Go in light and love.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I took a stroll through Occupy Oakland the other day -- and was, quite frankly, disappointed. I expected to see a lenticular cloud of pot smoke above &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plaza&quot; but the air was still and the campers were quiet. I guess 3 p.m. is early when you've been up all night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, I can't help but wonder if the whole thing will fizzle out when the weather turns foul. I hope so. These folks need to break camp and figure out a plan that supports the 99 percent -- not drives them away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an open letter to Occupy Oakland this week, District 4 Councilmember Libby Schaaf cites these facts in calling for the encampment to disband: Three businesses pulled out of lease negotiations in downtown Oakland last week; the protest has cost our city more than $1 million to date and created health and safety problems that the protesters refuse to address; it's stretched our resources so thin that one night alone, 179 calls to police on 911 went unanswered and the encampment has provided cover and opportunity for anarchists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schaaf also says rumors that the city wants to relocate the occupiers to Woodminster or one of several other Oakland sites are false and that she &quot;unequivocally opposes&quot; any unlawful encampment by this group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, it will be hard to convince the protesters to leave, and using force will just cause them to dig in their heels. So I'm calling on the occupiers to declare victory and rally around the Buy American campaign to create income equity. Statistics show that if we each spend an extra $3.33 on U.S. made goods, it will create almost 10,000 new jobs in this country. It makes a lot more sense than smashing windows and spraying graffiti on struggling small businesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland, Calif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JEAN QUAN may be the first in many categories -- the first Asian-American and first woman to be mayor of Oakland -- but she is far from the city's first chief executive to face off with its police force. While dozens of mayors around the country have had to deal with Occupy movements, only Ms. Quan has seen the initially peaceful protests turn into street violence and even a general strike -- a turn almost wholly attributable to the brutality of the city police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their zeal to fight back, however, the protesters, many of them white out-of-towners, have left locals unsure of who really has their best interests at heart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Oct. 25 the world saw an Oakland police force that blacks have had to deal with for decades -- even before the Black Panthers organized to protest the shooting of a black youth in the 1960s, a time when the police were said to be recruited from the South because they knew how to handle African-Americans. In a video watched worldwide, an officer in riot gear fired a tear gas canister at a protester; the victim, an Iraq War veteran, later underwent surgery for his wounds. When some occupiers went to help him, another canister was lobbed at them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That same night officers allegedly used rubber bullets during an assault on campers in Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. If so, that would violate the department's rules of engagement. Those rules were adopted in 2003, after the police assaulted antiwar protesters at the Port of Oakland, even injuring some longshoremen who happened to be passing by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The force's viciousness, particularly against blacks and Latinos, is legendary. In one recent case, a group of officers known as the Riders, who racked up an impressive list of drug takedowns, were accused of brutality, kidnapping and planting evidence on their road to arrests. Another officer, nicknamed ''Audie Murphy,'' after the sharpshooting war hero and film star, shot four suspects and killed three. So little has been done to reform the force that a federal judge has threatened to take the entire department into receivership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of Oakland's officers don't even live in the city, but rather its suburbs, a fact that helps maintain a strong ''us versus them'' worldview. (At a recent community meeting I proposed that the city study a plan, developed by Detroit, that rents foreclosed homes to police officers for as little as $1,000, to keep them in the city.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police still have influence in City Hall, though: their union repeatedly and vocally criticizes elected officials, including the mayor. For years it opposed making officers pay toward their pensions like other city workers. (The union agreed to start contributing in July.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Quan initially supported the police after the Oct. 25 clashes. Keith Olbermann called for her resignation; so did Michael Moore, who made a nuisance of himself by barging into Oakland Highland General Hospital, demanding to see the injured veteran (who had already been transferred to another hospital). Support for the protests grew, with statements of sympathy coming in from Cairo and Dusseldorf, Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such pressure may explain why Ms. Quan later apologized for the use of excessive force by the police, and is now trying to take a hands-off approach to the matter. Needless to say, the police department has been critical, saying it was ''confused'' by her latest moves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of this has left Oakland's blacks and Latinos in a difficult position. They rightly criticize the police, but they also criticize the other invading army, the whites from other cities, and even other states, whom they blame for the vandalism that tends to break out whenever there is a heated protest in town: from the riots after the murder of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a transit police officer in 2009, to the violence of the last two weeks downtown and, most recently, near the port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someday we may discern the deeper historical meaning of these latest events. For now, what's striking are the racial optics. How did Asian-Americans respond to the sight of a diminutive Asian-American mayor being hooted off the stage by a largely white crowd at an Oct. 27 rally? And where was the sympathy when, in years past, unarmed blacks and Hispanics were beaten or killed? Why did it take the injury of a white protester to attract attention?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, those hurt most by the protests are local business owners and workers, many of them minorities. Jose Duenas, the chief executive of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Alameda County, blamed the Occupy movement for stalled economic activity. ''We've got no events planned, people are pulling back,'' he told a local newspaper. ''We don't blame them.'' The cash-strapped city has spent over $1 million so far in occupation-related costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local activism has been pushed aside as well. Even as Occupy Oakland has occupied the Bay Area headlines, hundreds of black, white and Latino parents met to oppose plans to close five schools in black neighborhoods. The following day there was hardly a single line of newsprint about the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c27"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Occupy movement has important things to say. But in its hurry to speak, it risks shutting out those who have been waiting their turn for a long time.</SPAN></P>
