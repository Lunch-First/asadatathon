<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON (DPA) _ Thousands of Americans have rallied in cities across the country to protest the shooting death last month of an unarmed Florida teenager, in a case that has struck a nerve in a country still plagued by racial divisions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dressed in black ``hoodie&quot; sweatshirts like the one Trayvon Martin was wearing when he was shot, and chanting ``no justice, no peace,&quot; protesters in cities including Washington DC, Chicago, Tampa and Nashville yesterday (our time) demanded justice in a case that many felt demonstrated lingering racism in American law and society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington DC, as many as 2000 people came to the steps of the mayor's office for a rally hastily organised over Twitter and Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Even with all the positive images you might see with Obama being president and a lot of steps we've made, we're not completely there yet. You can still be murdered for being black in this country,&quot; said Bless Davis, standing in a light rain at the Washington rally with his son, Logan, 3 on his shoulders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager at the heart of the protests was Trayvon Martin, 17, an African- American who was killed February 26 in Sanford, a suburb of Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His apparent killer was George Zimmerman, 28, is white and reportedly of Latino descent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT LEAST 21 US states have adopted the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws that allowed the killer of unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin to walk free after Trayvon's shooting three weeks ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a self-appointed Neighbourhood Watch captain, shot Trayvon dead when he saw him walking through a gated community after the youth bought a packet of Skittles and a bottle of iced tea from a local store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman told police he believed Trayvon was acting suspiciously and appeared to have followed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, supported by the National Rifle Association and introduced by Jeb Bush when he was governor of Florida, extends the right to use lethal force in self-defence from the home into the public domain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be protected by the law it is not necessary for a killer to prove that he or she was threatened, just that they believed they were. Or, in the words of the act, if a person &quot;reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday Mr Bush said he did not believe the law applied in this case because it appeared that Mr Zimmerman had followed Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been protests across the US over the past few days, with activists demanding Mr Zimmerman's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the radical New Black Panther Party have even offered a $US10,000 ($A9660) reward for his &quot;capture&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the journalists who propelled the case to national attention, Ta-Nehisi Coates, a senior editor for The Atlantic, has said that the law seems to have protected killers in other cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 21, Greyston Garcia was acquitted under the law after chasing Pedro Roteta, 26, for a block before stabbing him after Mr Roteta stole his truck radio. Mr Roteta was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police who charged Mr Garcia said the judge's decision was a &quot;travesty of justice&quot;. Also in Florida, Brandon Baker was shot dead by Seth Browning after a traffic altercation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we have in Florida - and doubtlessly in other parts of the country - is the state relinquishing a crucial aspect of meting out justice,&quot; Coates writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The logic here militates towards getting a gun - even for people who don't like guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar laws are being fought over in other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I anticipate that some people will try to use this unfortunate incident as an excuse not to expand Iowans' right to self-defence,&quot; said the Iowa legislation's author, Republican Matt Windschitl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not every &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, however, came from a Republican-controlled state. Oklahoma's Democratic governor signed one in 2006. So did Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano, when she was the Democratic governor of Arizona. In Alabama, a bill identical to Florida's was first introduced by a Democrat. With</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 26--Amid a new report that unarmed Florida teen Trayvon Martin had attacked his killer before he was fatally shot, several Albany lawmakers Monday wore hoodies in solidarity, while Mayor Michael Bloomberg lashed out against the use of illegal guns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Orlando Sentinel reported that Martin, 17, punched George Zimmerman, knocked him down and then slammed his head repeatedly into the sidewalk, according to an account Zimmerman, 32, gave to police that was mostly corroborated by witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a white Hispanic neighborhood watch captain, was patrolling his gated community in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26 and mistook Martin for a burglar. The black teen was wearing a hoodie and was coming from a convenience store. Zimmerman said he shot Martin out of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg, speaking at an unrelated news conference, accused the gun lobby in Washington, D.C., of &quot;writing our nation's gun laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg is co-chair of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns coalition, which is asking lawyers to help with research connected to the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor questioned why Zimmerman was allowed to conceal and carry a loaded gun after a previous arrest for assaulting a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just the craziest thing,&quot; Bloomberg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Albany legislators who dressed in hooded sweatshirts said they did so to protest the shooting and call attention to racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Justice Department is investigating the case as a potential hate crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 26--The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case rapidly capturing the nation's attention possesses many sad elements -- the tragic shooting death of an unarmed teen, the lackadaisical initial response from local law enforcers and an over-zealous neighborhood guardian in Sanford, Fla., where Martin was gunned down on Feb. 26. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boiled down to one word, the incident puts on display what drives far too many in the United States -- fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was walking home after a trip to the store to purchase a soft drink and candy on Feb. 26. Before Martin could return home, he was confronted by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, a suburb of Orlando. Zimmerman pursued Martin, fought with him and then fatally shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an utterly unbelievable turn of events, Zimmerman has yet to be charged in connection with Martin's death. During a police interview, Zimmerman, 28, apparently cited Florida's Stand Your Ground law, a state code that supporters say bolsters self-defense. Granting that many questions remain unanswered at this point, it's a mystery how the shooter felt threatened by someone who was attempting to run away from him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, according to police records, spotted Martin on the evening of Feb. 26, calling him &quot;suspicious.&quot; Zimmerman, who had called the police 46 times in the past year, defied a 911 operator's request to not pursue Martin. Those 911 records portray an overzealous watchdog who seemed preoccupied with targeting black males in and around his neighborhood. Martin was black, and Zimmerman is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of the shooting, Zimmerman called police to report, &quot;Hey, we've had some break-ins in my neighborhood, and there's a real suspicious guy at Retreat View Circle. This guy looks like he's up to no good.&quot; It's difficult to imagine a world in which a 140-pound high school student carrying a can of iced tea and a bag of Skittles would pose a serious threat, especially to a 250-pound man carrying a concealed 9-milimeter handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such is the state of Fearful America, a place where no amount of concealed-carry and self-defense laws is ever enough to stop the looming shadow of crime, a perception that defies reality and reason. The violent crime rate across the country is on a downward trend, yet no amount of evidence is enough to calm the fears of some Americans. From what we know so far, it appears that Zimmerman may have been held captive by consuming worries that every stranger he encountered was a suspect. If so, that overriding fear proved lethal for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcry of a nation amplified through social media finally caught the attention of authorities last week. State and federal investigators reported that they were taking a fresh look into the case. A more difficult task for the entire nation will be to put fears about crime and self-defense into their proper perspective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Atlanta, the city with the highest concentration of historically black colleges in the country, the death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin has struck an angry chord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students from Clark Atlanta University, Spelman College, Morehouse College and other local schools will rally on the steps of the Capitol at 5:30 p.m. today to protest the shooting death of the Florida teen and to call attention to a law that some say has allowed Martin's shooter, George Zimmerman, to remain free. Georgia has its own version, known as the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unarmed Martin was shot and killed Feb. 26 by a neighborhood watch captain in Sanford, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who has not been charged, said he shot Martin in self-defense. But tapes of 911 calls made after the shooting appear to conflict with his description of what happened. Martin was talking on his cellphone and walking home from the store when Zimmerman saw him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department and FBI are investigating the killing, and a state grand jury is being convened to determine whether charges should be brought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many college students are now reconsidering this case and our place in America,&quot; said Rashad Raymond Moore, a senior philosophy major at Morehouse, the country's only all-male black college. &quot;We realize that our status as college students is no different than Trayvon's or any black male walking the streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, police have cited the state's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law in deciding not to charge Zimmerman. The law says citizens can use deadly force against attackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2006, Georgia passed its own &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law that extended Georgians' right to use deadly force to defend themselves, which at the time were restricted to a person's home and car, to public places such as parks, sidewalks and parking lots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Monroe, vice president of the gun-rights organization Georgiacarry.org, said the Georgia law has little to do with the Martin shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If somebody shot somebody unjustly, they should be prosecuted. That doesn't bear on the right to defend themselves or not,&quot; said Monroe. &quot;If someone is attacked, they ought to be able to defend themselves with the best thing available at the time, which is what the law in Georgia is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markel Hutchins, an Atlanta activist and organizer of Monday's rally, calls the Georgia law &quot;regressive public policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we did not do something, what happened in Sanford could happen in Sandy Springs,&quot; Hutchins said. &quot;What we have been reduced to is reacting. But we can be proactive, and we can make a strong statement to amend the Georgia version of that Florida statute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's death and the decision by police to not arrest Zimmerman have triggered dozens of protests around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is the value of black life and bodies here in America?&quot; asked Moore. &quot;Many have raised the argument that, if the situation were reversed, Trayvon would be under the jail. If Trayvon were a dog, animal-rights groups would have had Zimmerman locked under the jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from the rallies, hundreds more --- black and white --- have posted photographs of themselves on social media sites like Facebook, wearing black hoodies, which is what Martin was wearing the night he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday, the Rev. Raphael G. Warnock of Ebenezer Baptist Church, delivered his sermon in a hoodie. Members of the choir, ministers, deacons and deaconesses as well as church members also wore hoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First and foremost, it is a tragedy,&quot; said Tyler Joshua Green, a 19-year-old sophomore religion major at CAU, where a separate rally will be held Wednesday. &quot;Not just for him and family, but for the race. That we still have issues like this and racism is alive and well. But there is still hope and justice and people trying to find that and keep that alive. With any tragedy, there is something to be gained out of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, senior pastor of Atlanta's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, greeted more than 2,500 congregants at the 11 a.m. service in a hoodie --- a Morehouse College hoodie to be exact --- worn with gray dress pants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a show of support for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the black 17-year-old who was killed Feb. 26 while returning from a convenience store to a gated community in Sanford, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warnock and his congregation joined churchgoers and demonstrators around Atlanta and across the country Sunday as sermons, prayer vigils and marches continued in protest of what is believed to be a case of racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was wearing a hoodie, the term used for the popular hooded sweatshirts, when he was shot and killed by George Zimmerman last month. Police said Martin was unarmed --- carrying a bag of candy and iced tea --- as he returned to the community where his father was staying. Zimmerman, who called in a suspicious person complaint and was told by 911 operators to remain in his car and not approach Martin, claims he was acting in self-defense and has not been charged in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attendees of the 10 a.m. service Sunday at Greater Works Assembly Church in southeast Atlanta were encouraged to wear hoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people wear hoodies. Athletes wear hoodies. There are people walking the streets, walking dogs. Hoodies are not germane to crime and illegal activities,&quot; said the Rev. Darryl Winston of Greater Works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebenezer's Warnock noted: &quot;As the church of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the church of nonviolent struggle on behalf of justice, we thought it important for us to say that a hoodie is not a weapon. We stand today in solidarity with the Martin family and in support of our young people who deserve better than to be stigmatized and stereotyped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he hoped the incident would become a teachable moment for the entire nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As law-abiding citizens, we expect that the police and the criminal justice system will operate in a fair manner and so far that has not been the case,&quot; Warnock said. &quot;Why not arrest Mr. Zimmerman and allow the wheels of justice to go through their process? Then we would have to be satisfied with the outcome. But without an arrest, the process itself is arrested. That is why you see such an outpouring on the streets of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Hector, 40, of Ellenwood, a member of Ebenezer, was pleased that his church recognized the injustice of Martin's death. &quot;I have been following the case in the media,&quot; said Hector, who was wearing a black and gold Pittsburgh Steelers hoodie. The father of four sons ages 21, 19, 9 and 8 said he worries about their safety in light of the Martin incident and given how young black men are sometimes viewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keon McIntosh, a junior at Lakeside High School in DeKalb County, attended the service wearing a Hampton University hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unfortunate there's a stereotype against black teens and how they dress,&quot; said McIntosh, a member of the church's youth group. &quot;People are judged by how they look and not what's inside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At First Iconium Baptist, another predominantly black church in Atlanta, the Rev. Timothy McDonald told congregants at the early Sunday service: &quot;We will not rest until Mr. Zimmerman, who killed young Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, is arrested. This could have been any one of our children.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputies charged Jesse Gates, 38, with burglary, disturbing a place of worship, and attempted kidnapping. The kidnapping charge was lodged because Gates allegedly pointed his weapon at the church pastor, resulting in his being restrained, Spartanburg County Sheriff's spokesman Lt.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gates told reporters as he was led away in handcuffs to a patrol car taking him to jail that his children had been taken away and he was trying to get someone to listen to him. Gates said he asked the church for help, but was frustrated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATLANTA -- The shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin reverberated across Georgia on Sunday with &quot;hoodie&quot; church services, calls for lawmakers to strengthen gun laws and gatherings to remember the teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activists in Atlanta are planning rallies to honor the 17-year-old, who was killed in February by a Florida neighborhood watch captain in the central Florida town of Sanford, and pressure authorities to make an arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Atlanta's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, hundreds of worshippers wore hoodies like the hooded sweatshirt that Martin was wearing when he was shot. The Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI: Lawyers for the family of Trayvon Martin and the Florida neighbourhood watch captain who shot the unarmed teenager dead have joined the national chorus of voices calling for justice in the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As demonstrators took to the streets in major cities such as Washington and Chicago to voice outrage over Martin's death and the local police investigation of it, a lawyer for his family told the National Association of Black Journalists that federal and local officials had assured them the case was a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a lawyer representing the neighbourhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, 28, broadly defended his client and said evidence would show that Florida's controversial ``stand your ground'' law had been applied correctly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman has not been charged over the February 26 shooting that has ignited racial tensions and raised questions about the Sanford police's handling of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was black, and Mr Zimmerman's father is white and his mother is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was walking to a friend's home when Mr Zimmerman started following him, telling police dispatchers he looked suspicious. The two got into a fight in the gated community and Mr Zimmerman pulled out his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Is George a racist? The answer is no, absolutely not. He's not a racist,'' lawyer Craig Sonner said about his client. ``The incident that transpired is not racially motivated or a hate crime in any way. It was self-defence.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sonner declined to say what transpired between Mr Zimmerman and Martin but said the case fell under Florida's ``stand your ground'' law, which allows people to ``meet force with force'' if attacked. ``I believe we have a good case,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting and a grand jury will meet on April 10 to consider evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama called the shooting a tragedy and said: ``When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daryl Parks, the Martin family lawyer, said federal and local officials met with the teen's family and gave them ``a strong sense that (the Department of) Justice was very committed'' to investigating the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Parks also said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement had told the family's legal team they knew where Mr Zimmerman was but it was unclear whether they were offering protection to him. He has been in hiding after he received death threats. Members of the New Black Panther Party are offering a $10,000 reward for his ``capture''.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington Post, Saturday March 24</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House officials almost certainly knew President Barack Obama would be asked about the Trayvon Martin shooting soon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has stirred immense passion nationwide because of its racial element: Martin, who was unarmed, was killed by George Zimmerman, 28, a Hispanic neighbourhood watch volunteer, who told police that he shot the black teenager in self-defence. Zimmerman has not been charged over Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama did not deal with the details of the incident, discussing the racially charged incident with deep emotion without saying the words &quot;black&quot; or &quot;race&quot;. Obama's new approach is at once deeply personal and completely universal, and avidly avoids taking sides in a political fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His appeal on Friday was to the parents. &quot;I can only imagine what these parents are going through,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pulls together - federal, state and local - to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embedded in his remarks in the Rose Garden was a particular message about being a black parent. &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said. &quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most indelible images from the O.J. Simpson story came when a TV camera crew set up in a lecture hall at Howard University, a mostly black school. The law school class sat, waiting to hear the verdict in the controversial murder trial. When the not guilty decision was announced, the students -- all of whom appeared to be of African descent -- burst out of their seats in jubilation, hugging each other and cheering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reaction seemed, to nonblacks, bizarre. What could the students possibly be cheering? That a former football player and second-rate actor, who did little for and with his fellow African-Americans, had beaten the odds? Were they cheering the success of the savvy and flamboyant attorney, Johnnie Cochran? Or was it all this and more? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tragic death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the Sanford, Fla., 17-year-old shot to death by a man acting under the auspices of a neighborhood watch program in a gated community again highlights this perception gap. Though contrary versions of what led to the shooting are now in play, the fact that an unarmed black teen raised the suspicions of a 28-year-old armed man should be troubling to all. And it should shed light on what life is like as a minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too often, nonblacks dismiss the complaints of stereotyping and profiling as paranoia or political grandstanding. Most nonblack Americans do not see themselves as bigoted, so they logically conclude that the complaints are unfounded, or at least exaggerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's the heart of this disconnect. Until nonblacks walk in the shoes of people of color, they can never understand what it's like to be on the receiving end of nervous glances and suspicious questions. Even if Trayvon&nbsp;Martin assaulted George Zimmerman, the man who admitted to shooting the teen, Mr. Zimmerman had already called police about the black teen walking through the gated community before the two had any contact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">This guilty-until-proven-innocent reaction is evidence of a serious divide in our society. From time to time, we are confronted with this divide and reminded of its pervasiveness and corrosiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, there is an economic component. When the economy sours, the poor become more desperate, the middle class and working poor become more resentful of those receiving state assistance and the rich become suspicious of class unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, of course, there is often a political component to these fissures in the social fabric. Florida adopted a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law which Mr. Zimmerman relied upon to protect him from his actions. The law, as it has been explained in news reports, allows people to use deadly force against someone they perceive to be threatening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Times columnist Paul Krugman asserts that the language of this law was not generated by a frightened populace worried about facing legal problems for defending itself from marauding criminals. Rather, the columnist writes, its language is similar to that drafted by ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council, the conservative think-tank that has provided templates for laws in many state legislatures, including Maine's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, legislators are responsible for the bills they approve, and so ALEC and its counterparts on the right and left should not be demonized. But the fact that a conservative think-tank has on its agenda a law to provide cover for would-be vigilantes speaks of a more profound divide than that between blacks and whites, haves and have nots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin story may be an aberration, or it may be more evidence that our society is focused less on what we have in common and more on what divides us.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dressed in black &quot;hoodie&quot; sweatshirts like the one Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was wearing when he was shot, and chanting &quot;no justice, no peace,&quot; protesters in cities including Washington DC, Chicago, Tampa and Nashville on Saturday demanded justice in a case that many feel demonstrates lingering racism in American law and society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington DC, as many as 2000 people came to the steps of the mayor's office for a rally hastily organised over Twitter and Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager at the heart of the protests was Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, an African-American who was killed February 26 in Sanford, a suburb of Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His apparent killer, George Zimmerman, 28, is white and reportedly of Latino descent. He was a neighbourhood security patrol volunteer who was carrying a legal weapon. He reportedly used a racial epithet in a recorded call to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford police said an initial investigation did not find enough evidence to arrest Zimmerman, who claimed to have acted in self-defence. A grand jury will decide April 10 whether to charge Zimmerman with murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday's rallies continued several days of protests that started with a &quot;million-hoodie march&quot; in New York and Miami March 21.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm here to explain why George Zimmerman is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This seems necessary given the confusion and anger with which some readers responded to my use of that word last week in this space to describe the man who shot an unarmed black teenager named Trayvon Martin to death last month in Sanford, Fla. One person wrote: &quot;Mr. Zimmerman was Hispanic not White plez do your homework before writing your column!!!!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is they who are wrong. There are two reasons. The short one is this: &quot;Hispanic&quot; is not a race, but an ethnicity. As the U.S. Census Bureau puts it in its 2010 Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin, &quot;People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be any race.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long reason begins with an understanding that the word in question -- race -- is a term both meaningful and yet, profoundly meaningless. It is meaningful in the sense that it provides a tool for tribalism and a means by which to organize our biases, fears, observations, social challenges and sundry cultural products. It is meaningless in the sense that there exists no definition of &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot; that carries any degree of scientific precision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are taught to believe the opposite, that &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; are self-evident and immutable. But I invite you to look up Walter White, the blond, blue-eyed &quot;Negro&quot; who once led the NAACP, or Gregory Howard Williams, the university president who didn't even know he was black until he was 10 years old. Dig up the old Jet magazine story about a woman who gave birth to twins -- one &quot;black,&quot; one &quot;white.&quot; And then think again. Race is a cruel and stupid fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people who came here from Europe did not automatically consider themselves &quot;white.&quot; They identified as Irish, Hungarian, Italian, Jewish, Armenian. As David R. Roediger observes in his book, &quot;Working Toward Whiteness: How America's Immigrants Became White,&quot; they were emphatically taught that &quot;white&quot; was the identity that conferred status and privilege and that it was defined by distance from, and an-tipathy toward, black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor did Africans kidnapped into slavery think of themselves as &quot;black.&quot; They were Mandinkan, Fulani, Mende, Songhay, Wolof. &quot;Black&quot; was something imposed upon them as justification for slavery and other means of exploitation. As one historian puts it: Africans did not become slaves because they were black. They became black because they were enslaved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well into the 20th century, America recognized dozens of &quot;races.&quot; In that America, people we now regard as white -- the Irishman, Conan O'Brien; the Armenian, Andre Agassi; the Jew, Jerry Seinfeld -- could not have taken for granted that they would be seen that way. People like this had to become white, had to earn whiteness, a feat African-Americans have found impossible to duplicate, no matter how many harsh chemicals they use on their hair and skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White, then, is not simply color, but privilege, in the sense of having one's personhood and individuality respected, a privilege so basic I doubt it registers with many whites as privilege at all. We're talking about the privilege of being seen, of having your worth presumed, of receiving the benefit of the doubt and some human compassion, of being treated as if you matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider that, then consider the fair-skinned Hispanic man, George Zimmerman, who evidently stalked and killed an unarmed kid he wrongly thought was up to no good, yet was not arrested, nor even initially investigated. He said it was self-defense. Police took him at his word and sent him on his way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Folks, that's not just white. It's blinding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin is an illustration of how dangerous badly drafted laws can be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of the unarmed 17 year old, shot by a self-appointed neighbourhood-watch volunteer, has prompted demands that the shooter be arrested. Under Florida's controversial &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, that is likely not possible. The law says people have the right to use deadly force if they &quot;reasonably&quot; believe they or another person are threatened with death or serious harm. Zimmerman was detained but released by police who say they believed his account that Martin started the scuffle and that he fired in self-defence. Under the law, there is no need to prove imminent danger or the need to use deadly force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Canada, we have had our own-self defence debate in recent years. The result is a streamlined law that gives those acting in self-defence more leeway and should avoid future cases such as that of Toronto shopkeeper David Chen, who was charged with assault and forcible confinement after tying up a man who had stolen some plants. Clarifying archaic laws is a good thing, but giving vigilantes power to take the law into their hands is not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Clarifying moments are rare in politics. They are the times when previously muddled issues are suddenly cast into sharp relief and citizens are given a look behind the curtains of spin and obfuscation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last week, Americans were blessed with three separate clarifying moments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Paul Ryan made absolutely clear that he is not now and never was interested in deficit reduction. After a couple of years of being lauded by deficit hawks as the man prepared to make hard choices, he proposed a budget that would not end deficits until 2040, but would cut taxes by $4.6 trillion over a decade while also extending all of the Bush tax cuts, adding another $5.4 trillion to the deficit. Ryan would increase military expenditures, and then eviscerate the rest of the federal government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh yes, Ryan claims he'd make up for the losses from his new tax cuts with &quot;tax reform,&quot; but offered not a single detail. A &quot;plan&quot; with a hole this big is not a plan at all. Ryan's main interest is in cutting the top income tax rate to 25 percent from the current 35 percent. His message: solving the deficit problem isn't nearly as important as (1) continuing and expanding benefits for the wealthy, and (2) disabling the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Greenstein, president of the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, is tough on deficits, careful in his use of numbers, and measured in his choice of words. These traits make his analysis of Ryan's proposal all the more instructive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would likely produce the largest redistribution of income from the bottom to the top in modern U.S. history and likely increase poverty and inequality more than any other budget in recent times (and possibly in the nation's history),&quot; Greenstein said. &quot;Specifically, the Ryan budget would impose extraordinary cuts in programs that serve as a lifeline for our nation's poorest and most vulnerable citizens, and over time would cause tens of millions of Americans to lose their health insurance or become underinsured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to Ryan, we now know that this election is not about deficits at all. It is about whether we will respond to growing inequalities of wealth and income by creating even larger inequalities of wealth and income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week also saw the nation focus seriously on the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws that the National Rifle Association has pushed through in state after state. These statutes came to wide attention because of the tragic killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, the man who pulled the trigger, was not even under investigation until there was a national outcry because under Florida's version of the stand your ground law, a citizen has a right to use &quot;force, including deadly force, if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These laws perfectly reflect the NRA's utopia. No longer will we count on law enforcement to preserve the peace. Instead, we will build a society where all citizens are armed and encouraged to take the law into their own hands. If you feel threatened, just shoot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since when did conservatives start believing that laws should be based on 'feelings&quot; and subjective judgments? What kind of civilization does this create? Surely this moment should inspire the peaceable majority to challenge the entire gun lobby worldview - and that most certainly includes the legions of timid Democrats who have been cowed by the NRA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was, finally, that toy metaphor from Eric Fehrnstrom, a top aide to Mitt Romney. Asked on CNN if the primary campaign had forced Romney &quot;to tack so far to the right it would hurt him with moderate voters in the general election,&quot; Fehrnstrom replied that &quot;everything changes&quot; after the primaries. &quot;It's almost like an Etch a Sketch,&quot; he added, &quot;you can kind of shake it up, and we start all over again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The context matters because Romney later said Fehrnstrom was only talking about post-primary changes that would be made &quot;organizationally,&quot; a claim that is plainly untrue. Ironically, the semi-denial only reinforced the lesson Fehrnstrom taught: To win, Romney is willing to change not only his own positions but also reality itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives will need an exceptionally powerful Etch a Sketch to wipe the nation's memory clean of the education it received during the 2012 campaign's most enlightening week so far.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Trayvon Martin case: What cities can learn; <BR>Cities like Sanford must improve their community-building to reduce the kind of fear that might have led George Zimmerman to confront a hoodie-covered Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Monitor's Editorial Board</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">550 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many Florida cities, Sanford was hit hard by the Great Recession. Many of its 54,000 residents, along with police, tried not to let a bad economy inflame racial tensions or worsen crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then a month ago, George Zimmerman was patrolling his gated community as leader of a neighborhood-watch group when he fatally shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions still remain about this sad incident: Was race a factor? Who attacked first? How did Florida's Stand Your Ground law influence the shooting?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, however, Sanford, like many cities, can draw this lesson from the incident: When people in a community fear each other, it is far better to build up community ties than to add more fear by increasing the police presence, forming more neighbohood-watch patrols, or loosening gun laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To use fear as an official deterrence to crime can only go so far to safeguard a broken community. In fact, it might even backfire by turning residents against police. Or, as may be the case with Mr. Zimmerman, the recent creation of his watch group and the addition of police patrols in his neighborhood may have contributed to his level of fear toward strangers, not lessened it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many cities have learned that the best way to fight crime is to bring people together, starting with things as simple as block parties, more sports and summer jobs for teens, or a healthy voter turnout for local elections. Mutual respect and even affection in the public sphere can reduce fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Examples of this approach are growing. Boston pioneered a technique in the 1990s by bringing church ministers and police together to persuade young people to avoid gun violence. Chicago helps ex-offenders meet up with neighborhood residents to restore their community bonds. Britain has begun to adopt some of these American methods after recent urban gang riots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet tough economic times make it difficult for working people to be neighborly, go to community meetings, or engage with police and other officials. More residents are renters and thus not putting down roots. A neighborhood's shift in ethnic or racial makeup can reduce trust and a sense of shared civic values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police, whose primary job is maintaining order, are often ill-equipped to bring a community together. They prefer to be more feared than to act as a nurturer of neighborliness. And when they welcome residents to act as their &quot;eyes and ears&quot; in volunteer watch patrols, that same problem is simply passed along - perhaps even to someone like Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police can also do only so much to help a community appear &quot;respectable,&quot; such as fixing broken windows or preventing prostitution, panhandling, or homelessness. They aren't very good at reducing the anti-snitching culture in many neighborhoods or the hero worship of drug dealers in others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the shooting of Trayvon and the nonarrest of Zimmerman, police were the first to be faulted. Pressure from the Sanford City Council forced Police Chief Bill Lee Jr. to temporarily step aside. But eventually Sanford, like many cities, will realize that broad community-building is needed to prevent similar acts of violence or to be better prepared to react to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social justice beats out rough justice. And long before a call to 911 is needed, a call can go out for a community to come together.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Trayvon Martin was suspended from school at time of death, report says; <BR>The slain Florida teen had been caught with traces of marijuana several days before he was shot, though he has no criminal record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family and supporters of slain Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin found themselves on the defensive Monday following revelations he had been suspended for marijuana before he was shot to death by a neighborhood watch volunteer. Police also confirmed a report that the watchman claimed Martin was the aggressor, punching him in the nose and smacking his head on a sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was suspended by Miami-Dade County schools because traces of marijuana were found in a plastic baggie in his book bag, family spokesman Ryan Julison said. Martin was serving the suspension when he was shot Feb. 26 by George Zimmerman, who was patrolling the neighborhood that Martin was visiting with his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RECOMMENDED: Gun Laws: How much do you know? Take our quiz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, and family attorneys blamed police for leaking the information about the marijuana and Zimmerman's claim about the attack to the news media in an effort to demonize the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They killed my son and now they're trying to kill his reputation,&quot; Fulton told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanford Police Department insisted there was no authorized release of the new information but acknowledged there may have been a leak. City Manager Norton Bonaparte Jr. said it would be investigated and the person responsible could be fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump said the link between the youth and marijuana should have no bearing on the probe into his shooting death. State and federal agencies are investigating, with a grand jury set to convene April 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he and his friends experimented with marijuana, that is completely irrelevant,&quot; Crump said. &quot;What does it have to do with killing their son?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state Department of Juvenile Justice confirmed Monday that Martin does not have a juvenile offender record. The information came after a public records request by The Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 28, claimed he shot Martin in self-defense and has not been arrested. Because Martin was black and Zimmerman has a white father and Hispanic mother, the case has become a racial flashpoint that has civil rights leaders and others leading a series of protests in Sanford and around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Orlando Sentinel reported that Zimmerman told police he lost Martin in the neighborhood he regularly patrolled and was walking back to his vehicle when the youth approached him from behind. The two exchanged words, Zimmerman said, and Martin then punched him in the nose, jumped on top of him and began banging his head on a sidewalk. Zimmerman said he began crying for help; Martin's family thinks it was their son who was crying out. Witness accounts differ and 911 tapes in which the voices are heard are not clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanford police statement said the newspaper story was &quot;consistent&quot; with evidence turned over to prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, city officials named a 23-year veteran of the Sanford police department as acting chief. The appointment of Capt. Darren Scott, who is African-American, came days after Chief Bill Lee, who is white, temporarily stepped down as the agency endured withering criticism over its handling of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know each one of you - and everyone watching - would like to have a quick, positive resolution to this recent event,&quot; Scott told reporters. &quot;However, I must say we have a system in place, a legal system. It may not be perfect but it's the only one we have. I urge everyone to let the system take its course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanford City Commission held its first meeting Monday since giving Lee a no confidence vote, which led to his ouster. Martin's parents both addressed the panel, urging them to take steps to arrest Zimmerman. More than 500 people crowded into the meeting, which was moved from City Hall to the Sanford Civil Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are asking for justice,&quot; said Tracy Martin, the teenager's father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader Al Sharpton warned commissioners that Sanford risked becoming a 21st century version of the civil rights struggle in the South during the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said Martin's parents endured &quot;insults and lies&quot; Monday over reports that their son attacked Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the commission meeting, several thousand people carried signs, rallied and marched in Martin's support. Organizers said some 2 million signatures had been collected on an online petition demanding Zimmerman's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems like the police did not do the normal things they should have done. But that's going to have to take its own process now,&quot; said the Rev. Marilyn Beecher, a Methodist minister who came from Daytona Beach to attend the rally. &quot;It's important that we all stand for justice and that the community leaders know that this is not going to be overlooked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's family spoke at the rally attended by at least a thousand people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Martin called the crowd his &quot;backbone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I see the crowd here, I see Trayvon all over,&quot; Tracy Martin said. &quot;I know he is saying to me, 'Dad, I'm proud.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RECOMMENDED: Gun Laws: How much do you know? Take our quiz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Monday, an attorney for Martin's mother confirmed that she filed trademark applications for two slogans containing her son's name: &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; and &quot;I Am Trayvon.&quot; The applications said the trademarks could be used for such things as DVDs and CDs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trademark attorney, Kimra Major-Morris, said in an email that Fulton wants to protect intellectual property rights for &quot;projects that will assist other families who experience similar tragedies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if Fulton had any profit motive, the attorney replied: &quot;None.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did Trayvon Martin's hoodie contribute to his death? That's a question now roiling the national discussion of the shooting of the unarmed black teenager by neighborhood watch leader George Zimmerman in Florida one month ago Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geraldo Rivera gave this angle a big boost by writing for Fox News Latino last week that for many people seeing a minority youth wearing a hooded sweatshirt with the hood pulled up generates a certain reaction: scorn or fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you dress like a hoodlum eventually some schmuck is going to take you at your word,&quot; wrote Mr. Rivera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rivera has received a huge reaction, much of it negative, for his assertion that the hoodie killed Martin as surely as his attacker did. The broadcaster and talk show host is not backing down, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he is talking about an undeniable and unfair aspect of life for minority youths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It hurts to be assailed - but anger doesn't change reality - a minority kid in a hoodie in a hood not his own is a 911 call waiting to happen,&quot; wrote Rivera on his Twitter feed Sunday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics say this is akin to blaming women's tight blouses for rapes. It's an &quot;absolutely disgusting&quot; assertion, writes Ta-Nehisi Coates, a senior editor for The Atlantic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps pushed by this argument, many protestors across the US have adopted the hoodie as a symbol of what they feel is the lack of justice in the Martin case, given that it has been a month since the shooting, yet Mr. Zimmerman has not been charged with any crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 25 was &quot;Hoodie Sunday&quot; in many predominantly African-American churches, with clerics and congregants donning the garb. At a vigil in Montgomery, Ala., many attendees wore hoodies and carried ice tea, the drink Martin was carrying when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York and Maryland, some state House members planned to wear hoodies on the floor of their legislatures Monday. Organizers of a Monday protest on the steps of the Georgia statehouse were urging attendees to wear hoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twitter was awash in tweeted photos of celebrities donning hoodies. A much re-tweeted picture showed the Pope in a garment that was hoodie-like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Jesse Washington, the Associated Press national writer on race and ethnicity, over the weekend wrote a lengthy piece detailing what he called the &quot;Black Male Code,&quot; the things African-American male youths need to do to stay out of trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Washington, who is himself black, said that he has sat down with his own 12-year old son in the wake of the Martin killing, and told him that he always has to pay attention to his surroundings, especially if he is in an affluent neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Understand that even though you are not a criminal, some people might assume you are, especially if you are wearing certain clothes,&quot; wrote Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never argue with police, but protect your dignity and take pride in humility, Washington wrote that he told his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please don't assume, son, that all white people view you as a threat. America is better than that. Suspicion and bitterness can imprison you. But as a black male, you must go above and beyond to show strangers what type of person you really are,&quot; wrote Washington.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- With a single punch, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin decked the neighborhood watch volunteer who eventually shot to death the unarmed 17-year-old, then Trayvon climbed on top of George Zimmerman and slammed his head into the sidewalk several times, leaving him bloody and battered, authorities have revealed to The Orlando Sentinel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the account Zimmerman gave police, and much of it has been corroborated by witnesses, authorities say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has not spoken publicly about what happened, but that night, Feb. 26, and in later meetings he described and re-enacted for police what he says happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his version of events, he had turned around and was walking back to his SUV when Trayvon approached him from behind, the two exchanged words then Trayvon punched him in the nose, sending him to the ground, and began beating him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told police he shot the teenager in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders and thousands of others have demanded Zimmerman's arrest, calling Trayvon a victim of racial profiling and Zimmerman a vigilante.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was an unarmed black teenager who had committed no crime, they say, who was gunned down while walking back from a 7-Eleven with nothing more sinister than a package of Skittles and can of Arizona iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters have held rallies in Sanford, Miami, New York and Tallahassee, calling the case a tragic miscarriage of injustice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton headlined a rally in Sanford Thursday that drew an estimated 8,000 people. The Rev. Jesse Jackson Sunday spoke at an Eatonville, Fla., church, where he called Trayvon a martyr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has gone into hiding. A fringe group, the New Black Panthers, have offered a $10,000 reward for his capture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have been reluctant to provided details about all their evidence, but this is what they've disclosed to the Sentinel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was on his way to the grocery store when he spotted Trayvon walking through his gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was visiting his father's fiancee, who lived there. He had been suspended from school in Miami after being found with an empty marijuana baggie. Miami schools have a zero-tolerance policy for drug possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman called police and reported a suspicious person, describing Trayvon as black, acting strangely and perhaps on drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman got out of his SUV to follow Trayvon on foot. When a dispatch employee asked Zimmerman if he was following the 17-year-old, Zimmerman said yes. The dispatcher told Zimmerman he did not need to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is about a one-minute gap during which police say they're not sure what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told them he lost sight of Trayvon and was walking back to his SUV when Trayvon approached him from the left rear, and they exchanged words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon asked Zimmerman if he had a problem. Zimmerman said no and reached for his cell phone, he told police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon then said, &quot;Well, you do now&quot; or something similar and punched Zimmerman in the nose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman fell to the ground and Trayvon got on top of him and began slamming his head into the sidewalk, he told police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman began yelling for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several witnesses heard those cries, and there has been a dispute about from whom they came: Zimmerman or Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for Trayvon's family say it was Trayvon, but police say their evidence indicates it was Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One witness, who has since talked to local television news reporters, told police he saw Zimmerman on the ground with Trayvon on top, pounding him and was unequivocal that it was Zimmerman who was crying for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman then shot Trayvon once in the chest from very close range, according to authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police arrived less than two minutes later, Zimmerman was bleeding from the nose, had a swollen lip and had bloody lacerations to the back of his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paramedics gave him first aid, but he said no to going to the hospital. He got medical care the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Justice last week opened a civil rights investigation into what happened, and Florida Gov. Rick Scott appointed a special prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not clear whether the special prosecutor, Angela Corey, the state attorney for Duval, Clay and Nassau counties, will have Zimmerman arrested, announce that there's not enough evidence to file a manslaughter charge or present evidence to a grand jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 16-year-old-boy from Hayward was shot and killed Friday in East Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The very next day, a 31-year-old man was fatally shot in North Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You didn't know? I'm not surprised. The killings got minuscule news coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Oakland police had still not released the victims' names. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All we know officially is they were black males, and now they're dead. Oakland's 25th and 26th homicides in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone -- unless they've been in a cave for the last month -- who hasn't heard about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of the 17-year-old African-American boy in Sanford, Fla., has sparked national outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well it should.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's apparent &quot;crime&quot; was to be a black male and wearing a hoodie in a neighborhood where someone thought he didn't belong. That was enough to convince a neighbor of his father's fiancee that the boy, who was &quot;armed&quot; with a box of Skittles and an iced tea, was up to no good. George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch leader, first called 911 to report a &quot;suspicious&quot; individual walking through the neighborhood. He followed Martin -- despite instructions from the 911 operator that &quot;we don't need you to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who has a white father and Hispanic mother, shot the boy in the chest. He claims to have acted in self-defense, though he pursued the unarmed boy. The neighborhood watch volunteer told police that while he was trying to follow Martin, the teen struck him and slammed his head on the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An altercation that never would have occurred if Zimmerman hadn't taken it upon himself to follow the teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month later, Zimmerman has not been charged with a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been rallies all over the country demanding that Zimmerman be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has become the national rage to wear hooded sweatshirts as a symbol of protest. This past &quot;hoodie Sunday,&quot; congregants in churches across the Bay Area and the country wore them. People ate Skittles and drank iced tea, the drink Martin was carrying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should all be sickened by the fact that a boy could be pursued because of racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida authorities must not be allowed to think they can brush the shooting under the rug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet why isn't there anything even remotely approaching this level of concern over the steady slaughter of black men -- usually by other black men -- in our own streets?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why do people get upset and demand justice only when the victim is black and the perpetrator is of another race and/or connected to law enforcement?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, it's a media feeding frenzy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why not the same level of outrage?&quot; emailed one reader. &quot;A life is a life, a loss is a loss and when you're dead, you're dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a lot easier to get worked up about an issue in some far-off place. You don't have to actually do anything to help solve the problem. Just join the hoodie protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brenda Grisham is frustrated by the saturation coverage of the Florida case. Her son Christopher LaVell Jones, 17, was shot and killed in front of her East Oakland home Dec. 31, 2010. Grisham witnessed the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one has been charged in the slaying of the talented musician, who was headed to Laney College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grisham started the Christopher LaVell Jones Foundation, which awards a scholarship in her son's memory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She got a call asking if the foundation was planning a Trayvon&nbsp;Martin protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said that I was praying for the family,&quot; Grisham said. &quot;But I am more concerned about the 16-year-old who lost his life here in Oakland and that we haven't even heard about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grisham often receives calls and Facebook messages from people in the East Bay who have lost family members to violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many are angry and frustrated with the criminal justice system. Even when assailants are known to authorities, witnesses refuse to provide testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killings of 22-month-old Hiram Lawrence and Gabriel Martinez Jr., 5, remain unsolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who will call for justice for these families?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All these people are jumping on the bandwagon for the people in Florida,&quot; Grisham said. &quot;We have problems at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of men and women gathered outside Oakland City Hall on Monday to add their voices to those across the nation demanding the arrest and prosecution of the man who shot black Florida teenager Trayvon Martin one month ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of those who rallied wore &quot;hoodies&quot; similar to the sweatshirt that the 17-year-old Martin was wearing when George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, shot and killed him after a confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 28, said he acted in self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Martin's family say the unarmed teenager was a victim of profiling, prompting a national outcry and debate on race that has stretched from the White House to Frank H. Ogawa Plaza and elsewhere in the Bay Area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His life was robbed because of suspicion and perception,&quot; Charley Hames, pastor of BeeBe Memorial Cathedral in Oakland, said at the Oakland rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with wearing hoodies, some protesters brought Skittles candy and cans of iced tea. Martin was carrying the same items when he was shot as he headed back from a convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It reminds me of Emmett Till,&quot; said Sharlana Turner, 25, of Berkeley, referring to the African-American boy who was murdered in Mississippi in August 1955. &quot;It's a continuing cycle of no justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was heading to a grocery store in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26 when he spotted Martin and called police to report him as suspicious. Zimmerman stepped out of his SUV to follow Martin, despite a police dispatcher discouraging him, according to published reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told police that he briefly lost sight of Martin and was returning to his vehicle when the teenager confronted and attacked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kareem Marshall, 25, of Berkeley, said the murder of his mother, Pearla Ann Louis, in May 2010 made him empathize with the Martin family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the same pain,&quot; Marshall said. &quot;They have lost someone to violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, whose father is white and mother is Hispanic, was not arrested after the shooting because of Florida's personal protection laws. Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law allows people to use deadly force in self-defense, which is why authorities have so far not charged Zimmerman. Similar laws are in effect in at least 23 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State and federal authorities are still investigating the case, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This young teenager was gunned down because of how he looked, because of the color of his skin,&quot; Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, said Monday. &quot;We need to see justice in this case immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congressional Black Caucus will lead briefings on Capitol Hill this week on hate crimes and racial profiling, Lee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While this issue has shocked American culture, it hasn't shocked me,&quot; Lee said. &quot;The combination of the powerful gun lobby, racial profiling and hate crimes make this local matter one of national attention. Sanford could be anywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oakland protest was just one of many that have taken place throughout the country since Martin's death. It is believed to have been the first in the East Bay, though several people also demonstrated Monday outside the San Francisco Hall of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesha Monge-Irizarry, whose son Idriss Stelley was fatally shot by San Francisco police in 2001, said, &quot;We're tired of saying 'no more stolen lives,' adding, &quot;Now it's time for action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests also took place over the weekend in Chicago; Washington, D.C.; and Columbia, S.C.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Sanford, Fla., by a neighborhood watch guy with a gun may yet turn out to be a race-based crime, even as we keep hearing that the shooter, George Zimmerman, has a Hispanic mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We may never know everything that happened between Zimmerman and Martin, how much of the trouble might have started because Martin was a young black in a hoodie, and Zimmerman might have been one more gun-carrying American in the year 2012 who still thought the combination of the hoodie and the young man's color had to equal this: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We may never know, even after we get Zimmerman's version, if this was a crime based on race, or hate. But even in a shoot-first state like Florida, a jury may eventually be asked to decide whether Zimmerman was acting in self-defense, as his attorney keeps saying he was, on the night Trayvon&nbsp;Martin died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whatever did happen in Sanford on Feb. 26, after Zimmerman made a call to 911 and was told to stand down and did not, we already know something for sure:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young man is still alive if Zimmerman doesn't have a gun on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It makes Martin another official victim of the gun war in this country. And it makes Zimmerman one more person in the America where the National Rifle Association treats gun shops and gun shows like porn, who should have never been allowed to own a gun or carry one, even in a state where gun stores like the one I saw Saturday on Southern Blvd. in West Palm Beach actually have names like &quot;Shoot Straight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know who the straight shooter was on the night of Feb. 26. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was the teenager packing Skittles and iced tea. George Zimmerman was the one with the gun. But this was gun-crazy and gun-loving Florida, which has led the way on laws that allow the use of deadly force in self-defense outside the home with no duty to retreat. This is Florida, where young blacks between the ages of 13 and 21 are now 23 times more likely to be victims of a gun homicide than white males the same age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposite of all that is New York, which has the toughest and best gun laws in the country. But once you are out of town and out of state, you see the NRA relentlessly working to make buying a gun as easy as buying a lottery ticket. And if you fight the gun lobby and its tame politicians on that - or insane laws like Florida's Stand Your Ground - you're not just soft on crime, you're about half-a-criminal yourself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constant menace in New York City is illegal handguns, the way they keep making their way to the city from all the states in the South, where they worship guns as much as they do Jesus. Still: Somebody has to explain to me why the well-financed zealots from the NRA, the ones who want to make getting a gun easier and easier in America, aren't just a more well-heeled kind of menace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again: There is so much to know about what happened between Zimmerman and Martin, what was said, what really happened after Zimmerman's 911 call. What we will never know is Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's version of things from the night when he never made it to the home of his father's fianc&eacute;e.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that the victim was an African-American male in a hoodie now drives an increasingly outraged conversation out into the streets now. But the unchanging fact of this, now and forever, is that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, is dead because the other guy had the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is what Daniel Gross, the president of the (James) Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, wrote for the Huffington Post:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Zimmerman is the embodiment of the gun lobby and its vision for America. George Zimmerman is the NRA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes you wonder why we even need a gun lobby, at least outside of New York, where our politicians stand up to guns and where Mayor Bloomberg never backs up. Just about everywhere else the gun guys seem to get what they want. They now have 25 states with broad shoot-first laws. It means they are halfway to where they want to be someday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the rest of the country even knew Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's name, Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat from Alaska, was pushing the National Reciprocity Act, a companion to the boneheaded House Bill 822 (passed last fall in Congress), which allows out-of-state visitors to carry firearms as long as their home states allow them to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good times! It means that George Zimmerman - if he stays out of jail - might be legal walking around New York with a concealed weapon someday, might get the chance to keep our neighborhoods as safe as the one he was watching out for in Sanford last month.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A GROUP linked to the militant Black Panthers organisation has offered a bounty for the capture of George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch captain who killed an unarmed black teenager in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Churches across America held services for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the 17 yearold whose death last month led to outrage around the country after Mr Zimmerman, 28, was able to plead self-defence to escape prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a protest in Sanford, near Orlando, where the killing took place, Mikhail Muhammad, the leader of the New Black Panthers, announced a reward for his apprehension. Asked whether he was inciting violence, Mr Muhammad said: &quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally was one of dozens held to protest at Trayvon's death, as demands for Mr Zimmerman's arrest grew. He is in hiding and is said to be in fear for his life while a series of investigations are held into the decision of Sanford police not to press charges against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Black Panthers, inspired by the Black Panthers revolutionaries of the 1960s, has been named as a hate group by the US Commission on Civil Rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEMBERS of the New Black Panther Party are offering a $10,000 reward for the ``capture'' of George Zimmerman, leader Mikhail Muhammad announced during a protest in Sanford yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked whether he was inciting violence, Mr Muhammad replied defiantly: ``An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bounty announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilisation of 5000 black men to capture George Zimmerman, the Neighborhood Watch volunteer who shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing has unleashed a furious debate about race relations in America, echoing the fallout over the Rodney King police bashing and the OJ Simpson murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman in Maitland and Jacksonville -- where the 28-year-old worked before the shooting. Mr Muhammad said the group's national chairman Dr Malik Zulu Shabaz, of Washington DC, was receiving donations from black entertainers and athletes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They hoped to collect $1 million by next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party said they would not release the names of donors nor would they provide documentation to support the existence of donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Black Panthers announced the reward at a protest in Sanford yesterday, the activist group's third protest in the past two weeks over the fatal shooting of the Miami Gardens teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group called for Zimmerman's arrest and threatened to find and detain him if police were not willing to do so. But group members didn't call for the mobilisation of thousands until yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Muhammed led the group in chanting ``Justice for Trayvon!'' and ``Black Power!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``If the government won't do the job, we'll do it,'' Mr Muhammad said, leading his group of eight party members in chants like ``freedom or death'' and ``justice for Trayvon'' while raising their fists into the air. The party members said they were tired of the inaction of government officials from Sanford city officials up to the governor, accusing them of lying and delaying justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They accused newly appointed special prosecutor Angela Corley of being an enemy of the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``She has a record of sending innocent young black men and women to prison,'' he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 26--The shooting death of a Florida teenager in February that attracted national attention prompted some Oklahomans to speak out about injustice toward minorities and racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of people gathered Sunday in Oklahoma City near NW 23 and Classen Boulevard to protest the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old boy who was fatally shot in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26 by a neighborhood watch volunteer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, George Zimmerman, 28, told police he shot Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has not been arrested or charged in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seeing this scenario, it hits home. Ethnic and racial injustice happens,&quot; said Jason Quaynor, 23, of Norman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quaynor, a senior English and writing major at the University of Oklahoma, said he participated in the protest to spread awareness about the shooting and other cases dealing with race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there have been questionable shootings in Oklahoma, including the fatal shooting of an 18-year-old black man by a police officer in Del City on March 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Dane Garrett Scott Jr. led officers on a short pursuit before crashing near Interstate 35 and SE 15 in Oklahoma City. The officer said Scott tried to leave the scene and fought with him over a gun. Friends and family question the officer's account of what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not just for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. It's for all their voices to be heard at the same time,&quot; Quaynor said. &quot;It's an opportunity to seek justice and be seen as equals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters held signs and chanted at the intersection, encouraging people to honk their horns for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Martin was unarmed, wearing a hoodie and carrying a bag of Skittles and iced tea when he was shot. To pay tribute to the teen, some protesters wore similar clothing and had bags of the candy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group also had a banner with Martin's picture that read &quot;Justice for Trayvon. Am I next?&quot; Protesters took turns signing the banner until it was nearly full of signatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle Petties, 36, of Oklahoma City, stood nearby with her young daughters. Each of them held signs about Martin and their own rights as bi-racial Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petties said her daughters should be able to exist in a society with the same rights as everyone else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time for a change,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI The U.S. Justice Department could bring a hate- crime charge against the shooter in the killing of black Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin if there is sufficient evidence that the slaying was motivated by racial bias, legal experts and former prosecutors say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, only one such clue has surfaced publicly against 28-year-old George Zimmerman, the neighborhood-watch captain who fatally shot the 17-year-old Martin on Feb. 26 in the central Florida town of Sanford. On one of his 911 calls to police that night, Zimmerman muttered something under his breath that some listeners say sounds like a racial slur. Zimmerman's father is white, and his mother is Latino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It sounds pretty obvious to me,&quot; said Donald Tibbs, a Drexel University law professor who has studied race, civil rights and criminal procedure. &quot;If that was a racial epithet that preceded the attack on Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, we definitely have a hate crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, however, say the recording is not clear enough to determine what Zimmerman said. And many experts say more evidence would be needed that he harbored racial prejudice against black people and went after Martin for that reason alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There had previously been burglaries in the complex committed by young black males, possibly heightening Zimmerman's suspicions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are going to have to show he was specifically targeting this individual based on his race, creed, color, et cetera,&quot; said David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's parents, in a letter to a local newspaper, insisted their son is not a racist. Several black residents of the neighborhood where Martin was shot have only good things to say about Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has not been charged with any crime and is claiming self-defense under Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which eliminates a person's duty to retreat when threatened with serious bodily harm or death. He claims Martin attacked him as he was walking back to his truck, according to police.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred people gathered Sunday afternoon for an impromptu rally -- organized via Facebook -- to reflect on the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of the gathering at the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial statue in Denver's City Park was one of peace and community in the wake of the shooting of the African-American youth in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important that we are standing here, on what is considered hallowed ground,&quot; said Jeff Fard, known to many as &quot;Brother Jeff,&quot; who helped organize the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the violence that sparked the gathering was against a black teenager, a mix of races and religions was represented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of us will have to die before we realize our lives have value?&quot; Fard said to the audience, circled tightly together. &quot;People are not going to respect our lives until we respect our own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Community Peace Drummers began playing at 2 p.m. with five black youths wearing gray hoodies standing behind them with signs asking rhetorical questions such as &quot;Do I look suspicious?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doreen Watson and Sandra Mitchell are two black women who work at Regis University.</SPAN></P>

Richmond is president of the Deming High School Youth Council and Hernandez is president-elect for the local group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent trip to Washington D.C. for the National League of Cities Conference helped them understand that violence among young black males is a national issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our main focus in the discussion was to come back to our communities and try to find ways to resolve some of these issues,&quot; Richmond said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One such issue is racial profiling which has recently gained national attention in Trayvon Martin case. Martin was a young 17-year-old African-American high school student that was shot and killed on Feb. 26 by a neighborhood watchman in Sanford Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DHS Youth Council is an advisory group made up of high school students formed by City of Deming Mayor Andres Silva. The Deming Youth Council has been the model for other advisory groups throughout the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It gives youth a voice in their communities through offering input, suggestions and recommendations to issues that may effect youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We networked with youth from around the United States,&quot; Richmond said of the two-day conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second two-day conference was held where youth discussed general issues on each of their perspective communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in D.C., Richmond and Hernandez met with US Senator Tom Udall and US Senator Jeff Bngaman's staff members to discuss issues relating to students that come from Palomas, Chihuahua, Mexico to attend the schools in the Deming Public School District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Richmond, Palomas students are not being processed in a timely fashion through the US Customs Port of Entry in order to meet their scheduled school buses on time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately 500 students cross the border from Palomas to Columbus, New Mexico - five miles north - in order to catch the bus to attend Deming schools, 30 miles further north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of students miss their bus to school and some choose to return home instead of taking public transportation to school that is available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students, teachers and senior citizens do receive a reduced rate to ride public transportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Udall and Bingaman's staff will soon be in touch with the Deming Public School District, the US Port of Entry and the City of Deming to see what needs to be done to resolve this on-going issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SANFORD, Fla. (MCT) ? With a single punch, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin decked the neighborhood watch volunteer who eventually shot to death the unarmed 17-year-old, then Trayvon climbed on top of George Zimmerman and slammed his head into the sidewalk several times, leaving him bloody and battered, authorities have revealed to The Orlando Sentinel.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the account Zimmerman gave police, and much of it has been corroborated by witnesses, authorities say. Zimmerman has not spoken publicly about what happened, but that night, Feb. 26, and in later meetings he described and re-enacted for police what he says happened. In his version of events, he had turned around and was walking back to his SUV when Trayvon approached him from behind, the two exchanged words then Trayvon punched him in the nose, sending him to the ground, and began beating him. Zimmerman told police he shot the teenager in self-defense. Civil rights leaders and thousands of others have demanded Zimmerman's arrest, calling Trayvon a victim of racial profiling and Zimmerman a vigilante. Trayvon was an unarmed black teenager who had committed no crime, they say, who was gunned down while walking back from a 7-Eleven with nothing more sinister than a package of Skittles and can of Arizona iced tea. Zimmerman has gone into hiding. A fringe group, the New Black Panthers, have offered a $10,000 reward for his capture. Police have been reluctant to provided details about all their evidence, but this is what they've disclosed to the Sentinel: Zimmerman was on his way to the grocery store when he spotted Trayvon walking through his gated community. Trayvon was visiting his father's fianc&eacute;e, who lived there. He had been suspended from school in Miami after being found with an empty marijuana baggie. Miami schools have a zero-tolerance policy for drug possession. Zimmerman called police and reported a suspicious person, describing Trayvon as black, acting strangely and perhaps on drugs. Zimmerman got out of his SUV to follow Trayvon on foot. When a dispatch employee asked Zimmerman if he was following the 17-year-old, Zimmerman said yes. The dispatcher told Zimmerman he did not need to do that. There is about a one-minute gap during which police say they're not sure what happened. Zimmerman told them he lost sight of Trayvon and was walking back to his SUV when Trayvon approached him from the left rear, and they exchanged words. Trayvon asked Zimmerman if he had a problem. Zimmerman said no and reached for his cellphone, he told police. Trayvon then said, &quot;Well, you do now&quot; or something similar and punched Zimmerman in the nose. Zimmerman fell to the ground and Trayvon got on top of him and began slamming his head into the sidewalk, he told police. Zimmerman began yelling for help. One witness told police he saw Zimmerman on the ground with Trayvon on top, pounding him and was unequivocal that it was Zimmerman who was crying for help. Zimmerman then shot Trayvon once in the chest from very close range, according to authorities. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 26--The tragedy of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death has become a story that is both racial and post-racial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community watch leader George Zimmerman shot Trayvon to death Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla., in a case that has sparked nationwide outrage and protests. Zimmerman has not been charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon is black, and evidence so far suggests his skin color may be the biggest single factor that led to his death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is another story here about race: A diverse coalition of Americans have joined Trayvon's aggrieved parents in demanding charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This feels new.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now, we expect civil rights leaders to bring to the national agenda local cases of perceived injustice involving black Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the power of social media -- Facebook, YouTube and Twitter -- has helped stitch together folks who do not all see Trayvon's death in purely racial terms, but simply as a case of a good young man who lost his life for no discernible reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any kid in America</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before Trayvon ran into Zimmerman, his activities easily could have been depicted in a painting of Americana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accounts say he had been visiting his dad, and they were watching the NBA All-Star Game. This is what we want of our kids, right, to have a relationship with their father, a relationship too many don't have? It's a particularly acute need in some parts of the black community -- we all know it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During halftime, Trayvon went to a convenience store to buy a pack of Skittles and an Arizona iced tea. He could have been any kid on any day in America, in any store. He left with his purchase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately for Trayvon, he fell under the radar of an armed Zimmerman, who had been telling neighbors about black boys breaking into homes. A newspaper interviewed the watch leader's neighbors, and some of the black males who live near Zimmerman said they did not feel comfortable walking in their own neighborhood because he subjected black men and boys to such scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far as we know, Zimmerman did not know Trayvon. But he fit the profile Zimmerman must have had in his head of a thief -- young, black and male.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was talking to his girlfriend on a cell phone, and he was aware of Zimmerman, according to a transcript of the phone call. Trayvon felt he was being followed and quickened his pace, but he fought the urge to run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 911 call placed by Zimmerman reveals that an operator told him to stop following Trayvon and leave the matter to police. He apparently chose not to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't know all the details of what happened next, but the loud crack of a gun shattered what had been an American tableau of a child going to a store for candy and then going off to see his dad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman is not talking to the media, but his parents say he is not racist and that he is of Latino descent. (They have not yet clarified why a Latino cannot carry around stereotypes about young blacks.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His defense so far is a Florida law that says a gun owner can legally shoot someone if he is standing his ground and feels he is facing a real threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanford City Council has voted no confidence in its police department based on its handling of the case. The chief has &quot;temporarily&quot; stepped down. A grand jury will convene, and federal officials are investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some want Zimmerman charged with a hate crime, I don't think that quite fits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't appear Zimmerman went out that fateful day to go shoot a black person out of race hatred -- such as when the late soldier James Burmeister gunned down a black couple in Fayetteville, for which he was given a life term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zimmerman did appear to possess a notion of how a &quot;suspicious&quot; black male looked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this notion is what the broad social-media-driven coalition chooses to reject, as it takes up with vigor the cause of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family. When these people see the picture of the baby-faced Trayvon, and match it up with his clean, crime-free record, they simply don't see what Zimmerman did. And as a result, they cannot figure out why what happened, happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the larger protests last week was named The Million Hoodie March, to show that a boy's choice of garb shouldn't determine whether he lives or dies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, some people who stand with Trayvon's family don't believe race should be part of this story at all. This can lead to some tension with traditional civil rights opinion-makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some jostling is expected when a coalition becomes broad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's a small price to pay when we have an opportunity out of this terrible tragedy to move the dialogue on race forward, just as Trayvon's slaying reminds us how far we have to go.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FLORIDA: Members of the New Black Panther Party are offering a $US10,000 ($A9660) reward for the ``capture'' of George Zimmerman, the Neighbourhood Watch volunteer who shot black youth Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman - the man at the centre of the racially charged killing of the unarmed teen - is a former altar boy, insurance salesman and college student. Another label has also stuck in the public's perception: frustrated cop wannabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, his scores of calls to police showed he pursued shoplifters and errant drivers with zeal, reporting pitbulls, potholes, children playing in the street, open garage doors and ``suspicious'' youths, usually black males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of February 26, he tailed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin through the Retreat at Twin Lakes, the gated community where Zimmerman lived with his wife, describing his every move to a dispatcher who told him he didn't need to follow the young man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A scuffle ensued and Zimmerman shot Trayvon dead. Zimmerman claimed it was in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Black Panther leader Mikhail Muhammad announced the reward during a protest in Sanford, Florida, on Saturday. When asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly: ``An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilisation of 10,000 men to capture Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman in Maitland, where the 28-year old worked before the shooting. He declined to say when the group would begin its search.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford city officials condemned the group's appeal and asked citizens to leave arrests to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the New Black Panthers' third protest in the past two weeks over the fatal shooting of the Miami Gardens teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has consistently called for Zimmerman's arrest and threatened to find and detain him if police were not willing to do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House has hit back at accusations that Barack Obama was playing politics with the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 17-year-old was gunned down in Florida last month by a self-styled neighbourhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman. The unarmed teenager was buying candy at a convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said on Friday: &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon&quot;, and his parents were &quot;right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and we're going to get to the bottom of what happened&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remarks were condemned as &quot;disgraceful&quot; by Newt Gingrich, the would-be Republican presidential candidate. &quot;Any young American of any ethnic background should be safe, period. We should all be horrified, no matter what the ethnic background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is the president suggesting that if it had been a white who'd been shot, that would be OK, because it wouldn't look like him? That's just nonsense,&quot; he said. &quot;Trying to turn it into a racial issue is fundamentally wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On ABC's This Week yesterday a White House senior adviser, David Plouffe, described Gingrich's comments as &quot;irresponsible&quot; and &quot;reckless&quot;. &quot;Speaker Gingrich is clearly in the last throes of his political career,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California police say an Iraqi-born mother of five who was beaten to death may have been the victim of a hate crime. The killer of Shaima Alawadi, 32, left a note that reportedly read: &quot;Go back to your own country. You're a terrorist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alawadi, an immigrant to the US, died on Saturday after the attack last Wednesday. Police said her 17-year-old daughter, Fatima, found her unconscious in the dining room of the family's home in El Cajon, California at about 11.15am. Alawadi died soon after being taken off a hospital life support machine, police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fatima told a local television station that her mother had been beaten on the head repeatedly with a tyre lever, and that the note said: &quot;Go back to your country, you terrorist.&quot; The police confirmed a note had been found but did not release the details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The daughter had reportedly been sleeping upstairs. She found her mother in a pool of blood. A sliding glass door into the house was broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to El Cajon police lieutenant Mark Coit, the family told the police that another threatening note had been found earlier this month outside their home. But they told police that they had not reported it after dismissing it as a prank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A threatening note was discovered very close to where the victim was found,&quot; the police said in a statement. &quot;The victim's family stated they had found a similar note earlier this month, however did not report it to authorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigators have so far made no arrests and have not said whether they have any leads to the assailant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack was a shock to the Muslim community in the area, said Hanif Mohebi, director of the San Diego chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), America's largest Islamic civil liberties group. &quot;The family is still numb. They are trying to figure it all out,&quot; he said. He added that there had been an outpouring of support for the family from across California and the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist strikes, Islamophobic incidents were reported in several US cities, with attacks on people and mosques. But Mohebi said there had been little evidence of escalating tension in the area, and there had been no incident comparable to this attack. He said a taxi driver had been beaten in the area a few years ago, but could recall no other recent severe physical attacks on Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">El Cajon is a conservative city of 100,000 people 15 miles from San Diego that has become popular with Iraqi immigrants. The city is home to some 40,000 Iraqis, the second largest such community in the US after Detroit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously our community is worried about this but we want to make sure we get all the facts before we do anything. Our community is pretty much in shock at this point. Hopefully the police department will bring these people responsible to justice as soon as they can,&quot; Mohebi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family had only recently moved from Michigan to a house in a suburban street in El Cajon. A family friend, Sura Alzaidy, told a San Diego newspaper that the attack apparently happened after Kassim al-Hamidi, Alawadi's husband, had taken the couple's younger children to school. Alzaidy told the newspaper that Alawadi had been a &quot;respectful, modest muhajiba&quot;, meaning she wore the hijab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Himidi and Alawadi migrated from Iraq to the US in about 1993, according to local reports. Himidi had worked as a defence contractor in San Diego, serving as a cultural adviser to train soldiers preparing for duty in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been hate crimes in the past but I have not seen anything like this,&quot; said Mohebi. &quot;There are a very small number of people who act upon such ignorance. In general our neighbours are supportive of the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The murder comes at a sensitive moment for race relations in the US following the killing of a black teenager by a self-styled neighbourhood watch volunteer. Unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot and killed after being chased by George Zimmerman, 28, last month in Sanford, Florida, sparking a national debate about gun laws and calls to prosecute Zimmerman under hate crime laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Martin's death, protesters organised &quot;a million hoodie march&quot; demanding a federal investigation into the shooting. Martin had been wearing a hoodie at the time of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, 1,659 people had signed a Facebook page entitled One Million Hijabs for Shaima Alawadi. On Twitter, people used hashtags #RIPShaima and #MillionHijabMarch to express their sympathy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaked police report details shooter's account, as family spokesman reveals Martin had school suspension for marijuana <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida neighbourhood watch volunteer who killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin told police that the teenager punched him to the ground and began pounding his head into the pavement, it has emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was shot dead a month ago by George Zimmerman, who had called 911 to say he had spotted the teenager acting suspiciously in his gated community. Martin, 17, was returning to his father's girlfriend's house from the local convenience store armed only with iced tea and a packet of Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of Zimmerman's account came as a spokesman for Martin's family disclosed that he was serving a suspension from his school in Miami after traces of marijuana residue were found in his book bag. &quot;We maintain that regardless of the specific reason for the suspension, it's got nothing to do with the events that unfolded on February 26,&quot; Ryan Julison said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, said Monday that unnamed investigators were trying to destroy her son's reputation. Sanford police say it's possible the information was leaked to the media, but it was not authorised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've killed my son, and now they're trying to kill his reputation,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorney for the Martin family says the suspension has no bearing on whether neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman should be charged for fatally shooting Martin on Feb. 26. The 28-year-old Zimmerman claims Martin attacked him and he fired in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even in death, they are still disrespecting my son,&quot; added Tracy Martin, Trayvon's father. &quot;And I feel that is a shame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a growing national outcry, Zimmerman, 28, has not spoken publicly about the incident. But the Orlando Sentinel newspaper has obtained a leaked copy of the account he gave police in which he claims the teenager was the aggressor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told officers that he had followed the teenager but had lost sight of him. He was then walking back to the vehicle when Martin approached him from the left rear and they exchanged words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, according to Zimmerman's evidence, then asked him if he had a problem. The older man told police that he replied no and started to reach for his cellphone but Martin said, &quot;Well you do now,&quot; or something similar and punched Zimmerman in the face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Zimmerman fell, he claimed, the teenager got on top of him and started slamming his head into the ground, prompting him to shout for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tapes of the 911 calls from neighbours caught these cries for help, and Martin's family have been adamant that they came from Trayvon as Zimmerman attacked. But Zimmerman in turn claims it was him. According to the Sentinel, police say their evidence backs this account. One eyewitness has said he saw the teenager on top of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was only then that the neighbourhood watchman pulled out a gun and shot Martin in the chest at close range, Zimmerman's reported account claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police refused to comment on the story, saying only that it could not &quot;confirm or deny&quot; the account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressure on authorities to arrest the shooter intensified on Monday as thousands of protestors prepared to join Martin's parents at a rally in Sanford, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said that up to 10,000 people could take part in the demonstration, which comes exactly one month after the 17-year-old was shot dead in the town by the self-appointed neighbourhood watchman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is one of a series of events taking place across the US today to protest the handling of the case and the perceived failure to hold to account the 28-year-old shooter over the youth's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, prayer vigils were held in churches across America in memory of Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of preachers donned hooded tops in a sign of solidarity with the dead teenager's supporters. He was wearing the garment at the time of the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church in Eatonville, Florida, Reverend Jesse Jackson told a packed congregation yesterday that &quot;the blood of the innocent has power&quot; in relation to the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The veteran activist likened Martin to Emmett Till, the 14-year-old who was mutilated and murdered in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also listed the teenager alongside assassinated civil rights leaders Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King Jr, adding that his &quot;martyr&quot; death should be used to draw attention to long-standing issues affecting the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev Jackson is expected to attend today's rally and a subsequent town hall meeting in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will be joined at the event by the teenager's parents and fellow civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City authorities are expecting a large turnout at the demonstration, and have cordoned off streets around Fort Mellon Park, which has become a focal point of protest since Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Sanford police said they had been told that between 4,000 and 10,000 demonstrators will take part in the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the largest of a series of protests and demonstrations planned for today across the US, including one planned outside the US department of justice in Washington, DC.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev Sharpton is likely to attend the discussions. On Sunday, he held talks with Martin's parents and their legal representatives over the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton tweeted this morning: &quot;Spent much of last night meeting with the parents and lawyers of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin about the legal and movement strategy for justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anger has grown in the weeks following Martin's death, amid claims of police failings in the case and an alleged racial element to the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Sanford police chief Bill Lee stepped down temporarily. He was joined soon after by state attorney Norman Wolfinger, who recused himself following criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But neither development, nor the intervention of President Barack Obama, who delivered a personal statement calling for a thorough investigation into Martin's deth, have quietened the discontent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman claims he killed in self-defence and that the teenager was acting suspiciously at the time of the incident, with a hooded top pulled over his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of Zimmerman have cited Florida's controversial &quot;stand your ground&quot; legislation, which authorises the use of lethal force in certain situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it has been alleged that Zimmerman may have profiled Martin due to his race. And a recorded conversation between Zimmerman and a 911 operator shortly before the incident may contain a racial slur - although this has been disputed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's lawyer, Craig Sooner, has denied that his client acted out of prejudice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the allegations have added to the anger felt and have led to widespread protest among the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, the New Black Panther Party - a fringe organisation accused by the US government of fostering an anti-white hate agenda -put a $10,000 bounty on Mr Zimmerman's head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the reward, the group's leader, Mikhail Muhammad, demanded an &quot;eye for an eye&quot; in relation to the Martin death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dubai The killing of a 32-year-old Iraqi mother of five in California apparently for wearing a hijab has sparked a global furore across social networking websites Twitter and Facebook. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaima Al Awadi was repeatedly hit with a tyre-iron and left in a pool of blood in her American home with a note that said: &quot;Go back to your country you terrorist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people have expressed their outrage on Twitter under the hashtag #RIPShaima, where they commented on the level of discrimination being witnessed in the US these days. The discussion thread raised the point that &quot;hate crimes&quot; seem to be on the rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many tweeps conveyed their condolences to the Iraqi victim's family, others expressed their anger and disgust towards the irony behind the note found by Shaima's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tweet by @iiamelii said: &quot;Ironically, Shaima came from Iraq for a better life. So much for &acirc;EUR~American liberation abroad... and at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous tweets, including one by @loonwatchers questioned whether wearing a hijab in the US makes you a target. Many tweeps showed concern over their safety as Muslims and Arabs living in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others also discussed the increasing number of hate crimes taking place in the US on multiple links posted on Facebook, explaining that the hijab is a symbol of peace, not hate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A video posted on YouTube of Shaima's 17-year-old daughter questioning her mother's killer about the reasons behind the attack has also gone viral. In an interview with Kusi News, Fatima Al Awadi cried on camera asking the killer why he took her best friend away from her: &quot;We are not terrorists, you are a terrorist&acirc;EUR&brvbar; you're an animal, whoever you are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video that has been re-posted on Twitter and Facebook, has added to the anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaima's case has been linked to the recent killing of a teenage African American boy in Florida, Trayvon Martin, who was wearing a &quot;hoodie&quot; at the time of his death and was mistaken to have been carrying drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tweet by @Butheina said: &quot;Hoodie or hijab - this needs to stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another tweet by @Yemmeyummy read: &quot;First #TravyonMartin killed for wearing a hoodie &amp; armed with skittles &amp; a drink. &amp; now #RIPShaima for wearing hijab.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">339  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are good reasons why the killing of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old black youth who was shot to death by a neighbourhood watch volunteer while walking through a gated community in Florida, has attracted national outrage. Martin, who weighed 140 pounds and was unarmed, was slain by a Latino man named George Zimmerman, who had been pursuing Martin through the neighbourhood, outweighed him by more than 100 pounds and was armed with a 9-millimetre handgun. Yet Zimmerman claims he acted in self-defence - and local police initially agreed, saying they didn't have enough evidence to charge Zimmerman with a crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, the matter won't end there. The public outcry in a case with heavy racial overtones has attracted the notice of the Justice Department, which is launching an investigation, and the county grand jury. Yet many similarly suspicious self-defence shootings have received less scrutiny in Florida, thanks to a 2005 law backed by the National Rifle Association that gives too much of the benefit of the doubt in questionable shootings to the shooter rather than the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The so-called stand-your-ground law asserts that a person has no duty to retreat when facing an attacker and has a right to use deadly force if he &quot;reasonably&quot; believes he or others are threatened with death or great bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't know what happened between Martin and Zimmerman and are in no position to judge. But whenever an armed person shoots an unarmed one, the case should be subject to enormous scrutiny, of the kind best provided in a formal trial setting. Laws that discourage this might serve the interest of gun owners, but not the interest of justice. Moreover, we think the shooter in a justifiable homicide should have to demonstrate that he made some attempt to defuse the situation before opening fire, unless he was in imminent danger of attack from another armed person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy to make a case for self-defence when you kill your only witness, and laws like Florida's encourage a dangerous shoot-first mentality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DURHAM The Durham Branch of the NAACP celebrated the 95th anniversary of its founding Sunday, and speakers at the event honored past leaders and addressed issues of importance to the organization during this election year - public education, health care, equality of opportunity and the preservation of voting rights.At the ceremony at Markham Chapel Missionary Baptist Church, Roland Staton, first vice president of the Durham NAACP, discussed the strategy that the national organization is pursuing this year. That strategy emphasizes economic sustainability and opportunity; high-quality, free public education; health care for all; equitable dispensation of justice; and equal voting rights.&quot;Job one,&quot; Staton said, is to &quot;take advantage of our right to vote.&quot; He reminded members of the audience that President Obama won North Carolina by about 14,000 votes when some 400,000 registered voters did not cast ballots.The anniversary comes at a time when some ask about the continued relevance of the country's most recognized civil rights organization, which won landmark Supreme Court decisions regarding school integration and voting rights. Staton read off a litany of conveniences that were not around in 1917. &quot;There are a few things we did have 95 years ago.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We had racism 95 years ago. We had hatred 95 years ago. We had intolerance 95 years ago,&quot; he said. &quot;So long as these things exist, there is relevance to the NAACP,&quot; Staton said.See NAACP/page A2The killing of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin of Florida by a Neighborhood Watch commander, which has galvanized outrage nationally, was mentioned during the ceremony. The church's male chorus sang two songs that brought many parishioners to their feet. During an introduction to one of the tunes, one of the vocalists spoke of &quot;that young man that lost his life so unjustly.&quot; Staton, referring to Martin, said the outrage over the case was justified, but he read a statistic that in 2008 and 2009 about 45 percent of men who were murdered were African-American, and most of them were killed by people who looked like them. Staton asked the NAACP to marshal its resources against this &quot;self-genocide.&quot;Many of the charter members of the Durham Branch are important figures in the history of the city. Among them were E.R. Merrick, Julia Warren, S.L. Warren, W.D. Hill and others. Deborah Giles and Mary Flores of the Durham Branch lit a ceremonial candle in honor of the charter members, and read their names.Terry Allebaugh, chairman of the local NAACP's housing committee, gave a brief history of the organization. Among the organization's notable achievements was formation in 1958 of its Youth Council Branch, which led the sit-in of the Royal Ice Cream Parlor. &quot;For those who have come before, we honor you,&quot; Allebaugh said. &quot;We honor your memory, even as we turn our eyes to the work to be done.&quot;The Rev. Richard McMillan, pastor of Markham Chapel Missionary Baptist Church, gave a rousing sermon on the relationship between the church and the NAACP. He based his sermon on the chapter in the Book of Exodus in which Moses is called upon to lead the Hebrews out of bondage. Moses, McMillan said, &quot;was called to do a job.&quot; Like Moses, McMillan told members of the Durham branch, &quot;you are on a mission,&quot; to bring fairness and to right injustices, he said.In the biblical story, Moses leads his people away from Pharaoh's oppression. But Pharaoh &quot;is still here,&quot; McMillan said. &quot;I'm talking about Pharaohs who want to keep people under foot.&quot;McMillan took issue with the policies of the Republicans in the current Congress. &quot;I can tell you it's no time to be quiet now ... and let mean and evil people tell us where we can and cannot go, and who we can and cannot be,&quot; he said. &quot;While we are sleeping, the Republicans are getting themselves together.&quot;He also stresses the need for health care for all, and took a shot at growing income inequality. McMillan said he was tired of leaders &quot;expecting the working people to eat out of pork and bean cans, while the rich throw away food.&quot;About President Obama's re-election campaign, McMillan said, &quot;I believe we should give him another chance&quot;He urged the audience to emulate Moses and take on the job of registering voters. &quot;I don't believe [God] brought me this far to leave me,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENGLEWOOD -- A sea of men, women and children marched solemnly  through the city's streets Sunday afternoon to condemn the killing  of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the black Florida teen shot to death last month  by a neighborhood watch volunteer who wasn't arrested after he  claimed self-defense.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Dressed in hoodies much like Martin was wearing when he was shot,  about 500 people gathered at Mount Calvary Baptist Church before  the march where they spoke of race and justice as the case has come  into the national spotlight.     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Unfortunately, it can happen to any of our children, no matter how  much they do the right thing,&quot; said Marcia Pinkett-Heller of  Teaneck. &quot;It is a sense of 'yet again.' I think tomorrow morning  every person of color in this country should leave their home with  a sign on that says, 'Am I next?' &quot;    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The killing spurred demonstrations across the country during the  weekend from Los Angeles to Chicago to New York, where several  hundred people gathered in the pews at Middle Collegiate Church in  Manhattan on Sunday wearing hoodies. On Saturday, about 80 people  demonstrated in Paterson against the killing.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Martin, 17, was shot on Feb. 26 while he was walking from a  convenience store to his father's fianc&eacute;e's home in Sanford, Fla.,  by George Zimmerman, whose father is white and mother is Hispanic.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Zimmerman said the teen attacked him. Police and prosecutors cited  Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which gives immunity to anyone  using deadly force if they feel threatened, in deciding not to  charge Zimmerman. Martin had no weapon, carrying only a drink and a  bag of candy. State and federal authorities are investigating.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Organizers of the Englewood march, dubbed &quot;Hoodie Sunday,&quot; only  began planning on Thursday evening. But word spread quickly in  newspapers, on social media and from the pulpit. Hundreds descended  on Mount Calvary shortly after their own church services concluded.  Clergy members and leaders of the NAACP of Bergen County said they  wanted not only to remind North Jersey of Martin's killing, but to  help foster better race relations among all residents.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    With two men holding large American flags at the front, the throng  marched silently about a half-mile from the church down Teaneck  Road to Mackay Park.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Marchers said the hoodie was symbolic not only of Martin, but its  wider implication that a young black man wearing one equals  trouble.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;It's been hoodies, it's been sagging jeans, it's been you name  it,&quot; said Mark DeMontagnac, an Englewood school board member.  &quot;There is some profiling going on. We're dressed this way to show  you that anybody can have a hoodie on.&quot;    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Hasan Salaam, 31, of North Bergen said some white people get  nervous when they see a black man wearing a three-piece suit.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;They think black people are one monolithic thing that they see on  the news, on television and in very bad gangster movies,&quot; he said.  &quot;When people are educated as to otherwise, it starts to open up  people's minds that everybody has red blood in their veins.&quot;    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The march drew several public officials, including City Council  members, Teaneck Mayor Mohammed Hameeduddin and Assemblyman Benjie  Wimberly, D-Paterson. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-Paterson, and Rep.  Steve Rothman, D-Englewood -- opponents in the 9th Congressional  District primary race -- were also there.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;The first thing we need to do is bring Trayvon's killer to  justice,&quot; said Rothman, wearing an Englewood Fire Department  hoodie.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Organizers like the Rev. Vernon Walton kept pressing the need for  marchers to vote and handed out voter registration forms.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Also attending was Thelma Pannell, whose son Phillip, who was  black, was shot and killed by a white Teaneck police officer in  1990.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Fighting back tears, Pannell quietly told the gathering that she  hopes the Martin family can find peace and justice. &quot;I know what  they're going through,&quot; said Pannell, who works for North Jersey  Media Group, which publishes The Record and Herald News.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The vast majority of marchers were black. But people of other races  said they felt compelled to attend.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;It's heartbreaking for our human community that young people,  because of the color of their skin or how they're dressed are  potentially annihilated,&quot; said Isabella D'Agostino of Closter, who  is white.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    D'Agostino and her son Marcus Garfunkel said they believe the  Martin shooting could happen anywhere, despite New Jersey's  stricter gun laws.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I think it may make it a little more difficult for it to happen  here with a gun,&quot; Garfunkel said. &quot;I think the feelings that were  felt in this situation can happen here. That was the main thing  that caused&quot; Zimmerman to shoot Martin.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Dozens of Paterson residents and elected officials took to the  streets Saturday in support of Martin's family.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The protesters first gathered shortly after 9 a.m. in front of the  Paterson Public Library, where Pascrell and Wimberly gave speeches.  They then marched to City Hall, many wearing hoodies and carrying  bags of Skittles and plastic bottles of iced tea, which is what  Martin was carrying when shot by Zimmerman.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Several marchers carried signs that said, &quot;We are Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot;  said Councilman Anthony Davis, who was among the 80 people he  estimated attended the rally.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Davis said another rally is planned for 7 p.m. Tuesday in front of  City Hall and that organizers are encouraging everyone to show up  wearing hoodies.    </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior Obama adviser David Plouffe said Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich's comments about the president's reaction to the killing of African American teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin were &quot;reprehensible&quot; and &quot;hard to stomach.&quot; Gingrich criticized President Obama for injecting race into the incident when Obama said &quot;if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon&quot; at a news conference last week. But during his appearance on &quot;State of the Union,&quot; Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) boldly stated that &quot;we all know there is a racial component&quot; in the shooting of the unarmed Florida teen by a neighborhood watch volunteer. On &quot;This Week,&quot; Plouffe added that: &quot;Speaker Gingrich is clearly in the last throes of his political career ... You can make a decision whether to go out with some shred of dignity or say these irresponsible, reckless things. And he's clearly chosen the latter.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past few weeks Hollywood and, especially social media, have played important roles in the building outrage over the shooting deathof Florida teenager Trayvon Martin and the freedom of his killer, George Zimmerman. What was a quiet, late-February case in the small town of Sanford has become a national flashpoint, both for those advocating the arrest of the allegedly-racist Zimmerman and bigger picture observers who want to use the case as an opportunity to open a discussion about gun laws, race and equality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Checking all the boxes, both in medium in message, is director Spike Lee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's no stranger to advocacy for racial justice, of course, with many of his films and documentaries dealing with color and class in America, but through Twitter, Lee has found an instant outletfor his message and a megaphone with which to project the words and protestations of his followers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Martin case hit the national spotlight, Lee has tweeted out his own calls for Zimmerman's arrest and condemnations of a country that has yet to prosecute him.&quot;America The Beautiful,A Country Where A Black Teenager Can Be Shot And Killed Coming From A 7-Eleven Buying A Ice Tea And A Bag Of Skittles,&quot; he tweeted outlast week, while adding, &quot;Why Is George Zimmerman Still FREE?WTF?&quot; this weekend.But for the most part, Lee has engaged with others, supporters and detractors alike.Over the past 12 hours, Lee has tweeted 300 times about the case, most of them being retweets of fans and advocates from around the world demanding justice. With hoodies now a cultural symbol of resistance in the case, following Geraldo Rivera's accusation that Martin's wearing of a hoodiethe night he was shot made him a &quot;gangsta&quot; target, Lee has encouraged and retweeted photos of people wearing the hooded sweatshirts, with pictures coming from Sweden, Scotland, Japan and other far-flung countries.Lee helped spread the protest clothing meme, tweeting photos of professional athletes wearing them -- the Miami Heat took a team photoin hoodies last Friday -- and even a picture of his young son Jacksonwearing the top.There has been some backlash; the director has responded to various charges of reverse-racism and other angry accusations, and there was a slight uproar when he tweeted Zimmerman's home address. One follower threatened to tweet Lee's own home address, to which he responded, &quot;Tweet it, big guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 26--Every so often, a local story turns into a national one -- and then a local one again, as individual communities hold themselves up to the light and question whether a similar thing could happen to them. Such has been the case with the death of Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaving one obvious factor out, the incident in Sanford, Fla. -- in which an unarmed 17-year-old was shot by a neighborhood watchman who claimed self-defense -- is tragic but not unusual. Every day, somewhere, people die under dubious circumstances; every day, judges and police listen to conflicting accounts of who followed whom or who attacked first. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martin case deserves a thorough hearing in court, and with pressure mounting nationwide, I have no doubt that it will receive one. But the case has sparked a national dialogue less about self-defense and vigilantism than about skin color. At this point, has anyone not heard countless times that Martin was black and that his death appears to be racially motivated?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last month, a Time magazine columnist published a piece advising parents on how to talk to black boys about the Martin case. &quot;Black maleness is a potentially fatal condition,&quot; the author wrote, later suggesting that parents explain, &quot;You will have to make allowances for other people's racism. That's part of the burden of being black. We can be defiant and dead or smart and alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cities across the country became sites for &quot;Million Hoodie Marches&quot; that protested both Martin's death and the concept of racial profiling in general. The Chicago Tribune interviewed a local black father who said about his teenage son, &quot;I constantly tell him, 'Don't forget you're black.' I don't want him to run into that guy who does see color one day when he's walking down the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, the Sanford incident has turned into a story about all of us, about our perceptions of others and our practices in dealing with them. And that makes it a Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley story too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Huntington, in particular, has prided itself in recent years on overcoming a history of intolerance. In the 1990s, city leaders formed the Human Relations Task Force in response to a spate of hate crimes, and the program later birthed HB Reads, in which students and others across the city read a book every year about diversity and minority rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I've brought up Huntington's violent past with residents and law enforcement, I've routinely been told that it truly is a past. And that, however naively, was often how I viewed race relations in America growing up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In school, I read &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; and other classics of civil-rights literature. We stayed home on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. I attended class with a small but noticeable minority of black students, none of whom I ever heard called a racial epithet or excluded from activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At UCI, I had a black roommate; later, renting a room in Anaheim, I had a black housemate. Police never pounded on our front doors. About that time, I encountered the works of Larry Elder, the black conservative author who calls racism a negligible problem in America, and they seemed convincing enough -- hadn't I seen through experience that society was color-blind?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the recent articles are any indication, though, that's not always the case. And so, today, I'm asking Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley residents to share their thoughts on our neck of the woods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both cities, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, have a black population of 1% or less, but don't feel you need to be black to respond. Write if you have black friends who have been harassed. Write if you have black friends who have never been harassed. That goes for other races too. Police, security guards, watchmen -- let us know if you've ever been accused of profiling, or if you've known colleagues who really did practice it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's get a dialogue going here. And as for the Martin case, let's all -- black or white, conservative or liberal -- hold off on conclusions until we know all the facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A scandal that began with an act of vigilantism is threatening to breed more of the same, after a weekend of escalating tension saw militant activists announce a $10,000 (&pound;6,300) reward for the &quot;capture&quot; of black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's killer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer who followed and then shot the unarmed boy, had the bounty publicly placed on his head during a protest in Sanford, the Florida town where Trayvon died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was announced by Mikhail Muhammad, leader of a small militant organisation called the New Black Panther Party, who said he was seeking up to 10,000 black men willing to form a militia to find Mr Zimmerman and administer what they regard as justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he was inciting violence, Mr Muhammad said: &quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.&quot; To cheers from followers, who wore black uniforms, he promised: &quot;If the government won't do the job, we'll do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments were denounced by mainstream civil rights campaigners. Jesse Jackson, who preached at a Baptist church in Sanford yesterday, called it a &quot;diversion,&quot; telling reporters: &quot;I think disciplined, persistent, non-violent action works.&quot; They nonetheless highlight the increasingly-polarised nature of the controversy surrounding Trayvon's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 17-year-old, who was shot on 26 February, was remembered during protests in Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago, New York and several other American cities over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators wore hooded tops and carried bags of Skittles, the brand of confectionery Trayvon was carrying during his fatal journey from a local convenience store to the home of his father's girlfriend, in a community called The Retreat at Twin Lakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of Mr Zimmerman, who claims to have killed Trayvon in self-defence, began publicly lobbying on his behalf. Joe Oliver, a &quot;family friend&quot; who appeared on ABC television yesterday, said that he &quot;couldn't stop crying&quot; about the incident and now fears for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Oliver, who is mixed-race, was accompanied by Craig Sonner, Mr Zimmerman's lawyer. Both men vigorously denied that their friend is racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Records show that Mr Zimmerman called emergency services almost 50 times in the past year to report suspicious activity in his neighbourhood.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Oliver, who is mixed-race, was accompanied by Craig Sonner, Mr Zimmerman's attorney. Both men vigorously denied that their friend, who was initially described as a &quot;white male&quot; by police but claims (despite his appearance and surname) to be Hispanic, is racist. Records show that Mr Zimmerman had called emergency services almost 50 times in the past year to report suspicious activity in his neighbourhood. In most recorded instances, he identified the alleged &quot;suspects&quot; as young black males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before Trayvon's death, Mr Zimmerman decided to pursue him, against the advice of a 911 operator. On a tape recording of his telephone call to police, he complains, &quot;these assholes, they always get away&quot;. Then he appears to utter the slur &quot;f***ing coons&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Oliver was played an enhanced recording of the call by ABC, but claimed that Mr Zimmerman was instead saying &quot;f***ing goons&quot;. He insisted that &quot;goon is a term of endearment in the high schools these days&quot;. He then alleged that a screaming man, who can be heard in the background of other 911 calls made to Sanford police on 26 February, sounded like Mr Zimmerman. Trayvon's parents have previously identified the distressed man as their son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sonner used the ABC interview to claim that photographs of Mr Zimmerman and Trayvon have given a misleading impression of the relative sizes of the two. Trayvon was taller than his killer, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman remains in hiding. Local police, who failed to arrest Mr Zimmerman, arrested a man for sending threatening emails to Bill Lee, Sanford's former police chief. Mr Lee decided to step down &quot;temporarily&quot; last week while officials review the case to establish whether Mr Zimmerman should face charges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of St. Patrick's Day, my wife and I were at home, watching the NCAA basketball tournament on TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At some point, we heard sirens in the distance. But living where we do, near two level-1 trauma centers in the heart of downtown, that's not unusual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within minutes, however, I learned that something unusual had caused the alarm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For me, merely watching a game, political coverage, an intense drama or reality TV show is no longer enough. Ever the junkie for news, behind-the-scenes details, snarky comments and additional perspective-and increasingly unwilling to wait for an evening newscast or morning paper to get my fix-I often sit with my iPhone close at hand, checking feeds from Twitter and Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's how I learned about the tsunami in Japan. How I learned about the State Fair stage-rigging collapse. How I learned Whitney Houston had died. How I learned which candidate won which election. How I learned the Indiana Senate had watered down the smoking ban. How I learned where Peyton Manning was interviewing. How I learned Secretary of State Charlie White had been convicted. How I learned tornadoes had ravaged southern Indiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that night, it's how I learned five kids had been shot a few blocks from my home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspapers may be thinner these days. Print and broadcast newsrooms may have suffered myriad layoffs. But we're getting more information faster and from more sources than ever before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And increasingly, this instant and omnipresent feed of news, commentary and interconnection is not only informing, but also inciting response and delivering results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those of us in need (or want) of getting and checking the accuracy of information, modern media is a godsend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For folks at fault or trying to hide something, it's now difficult or impossible to pull off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, for example, a friend on Facebook was researching the name of a company making a particular product. He posted a message: &quot;Need some crowdsourcing here&quot; and described what he sought. Within minutes, three people sent the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recently learned via Twitter that one of my favorite authors had published a new book. I downloaded it to my Kindle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read fact checks on the accuracy/inaccuracy of various candidates' claims and counterclaims-often before they stepped away from the podium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these past few weeks in particular have highlighted the power of modern media to alter the public agenda and right apparent wrongs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late on St. Paddy's Eve, New York Times columnist Charles Blow sent a Twitter message saying folks could read his next day's column in advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's how I learned about Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old shot dead in Sanford, Fla., by a neighborhood watch captain named George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outrage was that Martin had merely been buying candy for his little brother, was unarmed and was a legitimate neighborhood guest. He was apparently doing nothing more suspicious than walking home from the store and talking with his girlfriend on his cell phone. That-and he was a black teenage boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Zimmerman called 911 to report this &quot;suspicious&quot; character, the dispatcher told him to wait for patrol officers and not to give chase. Zimmerman gave chase. Then he shot Martin dead. He claimed selfdefense and the cops let him off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by midweek, the alleged small-town injustice had gone viral, hundreds of thousands of people had signed online petitions calling for an investigation and arrest, and the FBI and the U.S. attorney general had intervened in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days, small-town injustice is hard to hide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, halfway 'round the world, there's the case of Kony 2012. Joseph Kony is head of the Lord's Resistance Army, a Ugandan guerrilla group. He's also the target of and poster child for one of the most sophisticated social media initiatives ever undertaken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group called Invisible Children wants Kony arrested in 2012-for turning young boys into a murdering army, for turning young girls into sex slaves, for making kids kill their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last time I checked, Invisible Children's Kony 2012 video had been viewed nearly 90 million times on YouTube.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there's controversy aplenty about the founders of Invisible Children, their modern media methodology has spawned headline attention to an issue that likely would have been buried by conventional media. They've put a Third World issue on the map. They're getting attention from public figures and policymakers. And they're getting action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, there's cause for concern in the demise of traditional journalism. But as a media and policy junkie, it's refreshing to see news, commentary and the public agenda influenced not just by a few richand-powerful media moguls, but also by millions of sources with wide-ranging resources and the means and passion to inform us quickly, challenge our thinking, and drive us to act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich accused President Barack Obama of improperly politicizing the death of a young black man in Florida. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican presidential contest swerved onto sensitive racial territory over the weekend, with two candidates accusing President Barack Obama of improperly politicizing the death of a young black man in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments by Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich momentarily shifted the spotlight away from a resounding Southern primary victory by Mr. Santorum, who captured deeply conservative Louisiana on Saturday with the backing of many evangelical Christians. Mitt Romney, who retains a daunting lead in delegates to the party's nominating convention, placed a distant second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old, was shot to death by a neighborhood-watch monitor near Orlando who thought he looked suspicious, Mr. Obama personalized the matter on Friday, saying, ''If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.'' The killer, who claimed self-defense, has not been arrested. Mr. Obama called for a full investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum accused the president of politicizing the matter and ''trying to drive a wedge into the country'' rather than trying ''to bring people together.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newt Gingrich, who finished a distant third in Louisiana, went so far as to call Mr. Obama's comment ''disgraceful.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Is the president suggesting that if it had been a white who had been shot that would be O.K., because it wouldn't look like him?'' he asked. ''That's just nonsense.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a rare invocation of race on the campaign trail, and both candidates' remarks were sharply rebuffed by David Plouffe, a senior Obama adviser. He told ''Fox News Sunday'' that Mr. Obama was just trying to show empathy to the Martin family and that the Republicans' comments were ''irresponsible'' and ''reprehensible.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as a Romney aide last week cut short attention to his candidate's decisive victory in Illinois by suggesting that Mr. Romney's views were as changeable as an Etch A Sketch toy, Mr. Santorum seemed to risk overshadowing the lift he got in Louisiana. By Sunday, he was treading more cautiously; he offered no criticism of Mr. Obama during a CBS News interview, saying only that he felt deeply for the dead child's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum's showing in Louisiana, however resounding, is unlikely to change the dynamics of the race. He won 49 percent of the vote, to 26.7 percent for Mr. Romney, 15.9 percent for Mr. Gingrich and 6.1 percent for Ron Paul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But only 20 delegates were up for grabs on Saturday, and Mr. Santorum won only 10, while 5 went to Mr. Romney, and 5 are uncommitted. So Mr. Santorum still has fewer than half the number of Romney delegates. The latest tally from The Associated Press gives Mr. Romney 568, to 273 for Mr. Santorum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gingrich's third-place performance was an embarrassing setback for a candidate who had looked to the South to help revive his candidacy. He received no delegates, despite having spent nearly a week in Louisiana. Mr. Paul has yet to score even a second-place showing anywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum can still complicate efforts by Mr. Romney to capture the 1,144 delegates needed for nomination. That has raised speculation that he is interested either in pursuing the presidency again in 2016, or being the vice-presidential nominee this year, to help deliver the conservative, evangelical, Southern vote Mr. Romney has had difficulty attracting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Hogan, a political scientist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, said Mr. Santorum had mobilized his supporters through networks of churches. ''These are issue voters who are committed to Santorum's candidacy and will vote regardless of what barriers are put in the way,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a major question remains over Mr. Santorum's candidacy: Can he draw voters from beyond his base of social conservatives?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Brabender, a strategist for Mr. Santorum, turned that around. He said Mr. Romney's showing in Louisiana showed that he had ''regional problems.'' Even if Mr. Santorum cannot win the number of delegates needed for the nomination, he said, Mr. Romney cannot, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If a candidate can't show that amount of support, we go to another level,'' he said, referring to a brokered convention in August.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free Speech: Some want &quot;hate speech&quot; measures silencing talk radio's voices of freedom. That would mean a chilling return to the left-leaning major media's monopoly on the flow of information. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On MSNBC last week, Democratic Party strategist Karen Finney blamed talk radio king Rush Limbaugh for the fatal shooting last month of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by a neighborhood watch captain in a mixed neighborhood in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limbaugh, along with Republican presidential candidates Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney, &quot;reinforce and validate old stereotypes that associate the poor and welfare as criminal behavior with African Americans and people of color, calling us lazy, undeserving recipients of public assistance,&quot; Finney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin incident, Finney claimed &quot;those festering stereotypes had lethal consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One might ask how Finney knows that Martin's half-Peruvian killer, George Zimmerman (whose photo suggests he's a person of color himself), listens to Limbaugh or has been affected by the candidates' speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in ex-Rep. Gabby Giffords' shooting last year, this is a case of a Democratic mouthpiece accusing foes of their big-government schemes of murder. So much for President Obama's call for civility in political discourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Finney is just one manifestation of a new war aiming to silence Limbaugh and like-minded talk radio hosts. After Limbaugh several weeks ago used rude words to describe a Georgetown law school feminist activist who wants taxpayers to finance her contraception, the Los Angeles city council last week entered the realm of government censorship of the airwaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 13-to-2 vote the L.A. City Council called on &quot;management of radio and television stations in Los Angeles to do everything in their power to ensure that their on-air hosts do not use and promote racist and sexist slurs over public airwaves in the City of Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the George Soros-funded Media Matters is spending a fortune on radio ads in Boston, Chicago and other cities to intimidate Limbaugh's advertisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who decides what's &quot;racist&quot; or &quot;sexist&quot;? The Gingrich comment Finney considered &quot;dangerous,&quot; for instance, described how liberal welfare policies hurt minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The left isn't targeting &quot;hate,&quot; but rather intellectual challenges to their big-government policies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON   Rick Santorum easily won the Louisiana Republican primary on Saturday night, capturing a deeply conservative state with a hefty portion of the kind of evangelical Christian voters who have helped him claim victories in 10 other states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The win gave Mr Santorum a much needed psychological boost but it will be unlikely to change the dynamics of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 20 delegates were up for grabs on Saturday, with 26 more to be allocated later. Even if Mr Santorum were to claim most of them, he would still have only half the delegates that Mitt Romney, his chief rival, already has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Romney s win last week in Illinois, as well as his endorsement by Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, dimmed Mr Santorum s political prospects, although his victory in Louisiana showed he could still complicate Mr Romney s efforts to capture the 1,144 delegates he needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a fundraising letter sent out Saturday night, Mr Santorum said the results in Louisiana had sent  shock waves  through the political world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tonight with our strong victory in Louisiana, our campaign has now won 11 states, tying a record and proving we can win in the west, south and midwest,  the letter said.  Not since Ronald Reagan in 1976 has a conservative candidate won as many states as we have. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reference was significant, to the year President Gerald R. Ford won more delegates to the Republican convention than Reagan but not enough to secure the nomination. Ford did win the nomination and lost the election to Jimmy Carter, but Reagan came roaring back to win in 1980. Some analysts are already talking about a Santorum candidacy in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newt Gingrich s third-place performance in Louisiana was an embarrassing setback for a candidate who had hoped to perform well in Southern states to rescue his flailing candidacy. In fact, the returns suggested that both he and Ron Paul would fail to acquire any delegates at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Mr Santorum s victory, the states that vote next   most of them in the Northeast   are considered more favourable to Mr Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Gingrich, despite his poor showing, seems intent on staying in the race. On Friday he said he would not quit even if he made no progress in Louisiana toward his goal of depriving Romney of delegates.  I have no incentive to get out of the race,  he said.  I have every incentive to talk about big ideas and watch Obama dance on energy. Where was the energy issue three weeks ago before I started talking about it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile senior Obama adviser David Plouffe said yesterday that the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination at times resembled  a circus show, a clown show .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Plouffe was responding to criticism by Mr Gingrich and Mr Santorum of Mr Obama s comments on the racially charged case of Trayvon Martin, the black teenager allegedly killed by a neighbourhood-watch volunteer in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Santorum accused Mr Obama of  politicising  the case; Mr Gingrich said Mr Obama was  dividing this country up .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Plouffe said:  I don t think there s very many people in America that would share that reaction. You know, this Republican primary at some points has been more of a circus show, a clown show and those two comments are really irresponsible. I would consider them reprehensible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of Mr Gingrich specifically, Mr Plouffe said on ABC s This Week:  Speaker Gingrich is clearly in the final throes of his political career.    (New York Times service, Bloomberg)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is essential that justice should be done and seen to be done in the case of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, which has caused enormous and still growing international concern since the death of the black teenager in Florida last month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon (17) was shot dead in circumstances which will reverberate in Ireland and elsewhere as he visited his father, who was separated from his mother, in a gated housing development with private security arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An armed guard made an assumption that a black youth, who wore a hooded jacket and appeared to be carrying suspicious objects, represented some form of threat and, after a confrontation, fired the fatal bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It swiftly emerged that Trayvon was a blameless individual who was fully entitled to be in the neighbourhood, had a bag of sweets and a can of iced tea in his hands and was attempting to shelter from a downpour of rain as he approached his father's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has further pushed the story to the centre of the US political agenda is that the guard George Zimmerman (28) has yet to be arrested for questioning about a killing which took place four weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To complicate what is already a massively sensitive debate, a law in Florida known as &quot;stand your ground&quot; can prevent criminal or civil prosecution when deadly force is used in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it should be clear that this provision cannot reasonably be applied to Mr Zimmerman and without further delay he must be interviewed under caution about the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intervention of President Barack Obama, who said that the shooting should cause US national soul-searching, was entirely legitimate, and he summed up his position in one striking phrase - &quot;If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On our side of the Atlantic, we are still considering killings with enormous ramifications which were carried out by republicans, loyalists and, on occasions, the forces of the state going back up to four decades and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US has the opportunity to demonstrate that it can swiftly and effectively address such matters within its own jurisdiction and the attitude of the authorities towards the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin will be closely scrutinised.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a little bit tough, because at this point, we don't know who the victim is and who the suspect is,&quot; Roseville Detective Sergeant Darin De Freese told FOX40.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roseville detectives say Tyler Jurickovich, an employee at Galleria restaurant Pluto's and another Galleria employee got into some kind of fight in the parking lot around 11 p.m. near the Sears Auto Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had some type of confrontation occur between two individuals resulting in one of them punching the other and that person then fell on the ground and banged the back of their head,&quot; said De Freese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The confrontation left Jurickovich in a Placer County hospital in critical condition. Detectives believe the fight stemmed from an alleged car burglary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the subjects confronted the other after finding him in his car and thinking that he was being burglarized, that's why the physical confrontation ensued,&quot; said De Freese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is -- when, as a private citizen, are you justified to use force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Freese says the law is very clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California law is actually pretty specific. You don't really have the right to use physical force in order to protect property,&quot; De Freese explained. &quot;You have the right to use physical force in order to restrain somebody as though you were going to place them under arrest, or to defend yourself, or to defend others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Jurickovich's injuries have left him unable to talk to detectives, the other person involved in the fight hasn't been arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We only have one side of the story,&quot; said De Freese.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A proud Stockton entrepreneur  and married father of four? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or a suspicious figure on the prowl looking for someone to take advantage of?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ansar Muhammad hopes to attack misconceptions on either side of the hoodie when he helps unite anti-violence advocates for the thousand hoodie march on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're doing this to join the national outcry for justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and to draw attention to the violence that's taking place in Stockton,&quot; Muhammad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That escalating local violence was punctuated last week by fatal shootings in which a suspect fired at an officer with a gun used in a homicide a few days earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It makes me feel for my children and makes me question the decision i made to come here,&quot; said Muhammad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marches calling for the prosecution of George Zimmerman, the shooter of unarmed Florida teen Trayvon , are tied to local violence in Muhammad's  mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says there's an absence of accountability at the center of the shooting incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police did not initially charge Zimmerman for Martin's shooting because he claimed self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the February shooting, Zimmerman's own rambling 911call and his pursuit of the hoodie-clad Martin, who was only armed with iced tea and skittles, have heightened calls for his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 911 calls and witness accounts seem to suggest that Martin may have physically attacked the neighborhood watch captain who was following him, but many discount those details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adrian McCoy of Stockton is among those who believe Zimmerman was solely in the wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just feel that something there needs to happen,&quot; said McCoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad believes what will happen on the streets of Stockton and Sacramento will start a new chapter in hope and responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This city has been on every negative list...miserable city...murder city.  We want to show that good people have concern for the well- being of Stockton, &quot;he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The marches will start at 4pm on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stockton's march steps off from Waterfront Plaza across from the movie theater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sacramento's will begin in William Land Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates in the cities of Tracy and Modesto are also in the process of organizing joint marches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of Seattle will also host a similar event at the same time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In southern Miami, a man shoots and kills an innocent black youth he thinks looks suspicious. Witnesses report that they heard the high school student screaming for help before he was shot and shot again. The victim was unarmed and simply walking towards his family's house after buying sweets at a 7/11. The local police don't press charges, and even defend the shooter without any real investigation. Any possibility to enact justice is left to the federal government, spurred on by thousands of angry citizens.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sound like the 1960s? It's not. The Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) announced that they will investigate the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, as local authorities seem to have failed at a proper investigation. The parents of Martin, the African-American youth who was shot to death on February 26 in an Orlando suburb by self-described neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman, had asked the FBI to step in and investigate the shooting, and others called for investigation by the Justice Department. The Department of Justice said in a statement that it would &quot;conduct a thorough and independent review of all of the evidence and take appropriate action at the conclusion of the investigation. &quot;The department also is providing assistance to and co-operating with the state officials in their investigation into the incident.&quot; Though there is no question that Zimmerman took the high-school student's life by shooting him in the chest, Zimmerman had not been charged with any crime by the police in the Orlando suburb of Sanford, raising a nationwide public outcry. Martin was a student at Michael Krop High School in Miami. He lived in Miami Gardens and was in Sanford visiting a relative. &quot;It's a shame that he's not getting any justice,&quot; Martin's father Tracy said. &quot;We're not, as a family, getting any closure. &quot;I feel betrayed by the Sanford Police Department and there's no way that I can still trust them in investigating this crime.&quot; Across the US, many fear that Martin's &quot;crime,&quot; for which he received a death penalty ordered by neither judge nor jury, was walking while black. Martin's family hope that the federal government will be able to bring justice to what many around the state see as a blatantly racist miscarriage of justice. This follows weeks of public outcry across the internet and across the country. Even Republican Governor Rick Scott was pushed to action by the outcry by ordering the FDLE investigation. Democratic Representative Corrine Brown, who represents much of the area, met the police chief and other city leaders this month to &quot;clarify the situation.&quot; She later sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder calling for a federal investigation. She noted that a &quot;history of racial tension&quot; in the community could lend itself to the lack of a thorough local investigation. &quot;How police immediately concluded that he had a reasonable belief of imminent death or great bodily harm from a boy half his size remains unclear and three witnesses have publicly contradicted this version.&quot; Zimmerman, who experts say sounded drunk at the time, was never tested for drugs or alcohol, as is standard procedure. Zimmerman had spotted Martin walking towards his relative's home. Police told him not to follow Martin and to stay in his car. He didn't listen and confronted Martin, with whom he apparently provoked a fight. Zimmerman says, however, that he stepped out of his vehicle and that Martin attacked him, causing Zimmerman to fire his semi-automatic handgun. But many point out that this account simply does not fit with other accounts of what happened. There were cries for help. There was a shot, and then another. With that final shot, the pained screaming ceased. Zimmerman was unscathed. Three separate witnesses said that the pleas for help were from Martin himself. This brings up more questions - if Martin was crying for help until he was shot how could he have posed any threat to Zimmerman? Most of the facts in the case are clear - Martin was unarmed, was in the neighbourhood for a legitimate reason and Zimmerman fired the shots that killed him. However, because of Florida's controversial &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, local police say they are unable to charge Zimmerman. According to the law, anyone has the right to use lethal force - to kill - a person they deem threatening. All of this makes the case for the federal government much harder to prove. The Justice Department warned: &quot;With all federal civil rights crimes, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person acted intentionally and with the specific intent to do something which the law forbids - the highest level of intent in criminal law. Negligence, recklessness, mistakes and accidents are not prosecutable under the federal criminal civil rights laws.&quot; This is an edited version of an article that appeared at Peoplesworld.org</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and supporters spoke out on Sunday on behalf of the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot and killed an unarmed teenager in Florida, saying he fears for his safety after receiving death threats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, who has claimed he shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on Feb. 26 in self-defense, is staying at an undisclosed location after widely circulated death threats and word of a $10,000 bounty to find him, said legal advisor Craig Sonner, who said he would represent Mr. Zimmerman if charges are filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fury over the shooting in the gated community of Sanford, Florida, of the 17-year-old boy, who was carrying an iced tea and a bag of Skittles candy, and the lack of an arrest or charges prompted demonstrations nationwide calling for authorities to take action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, Trayvon's supporters staged events at churches, where congregants were encouraged to wear hoodies, or hooded sweatshirts, like the one he was wearing when he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Middle Collegiate Church in New York City, the minister and members of the congregation wore hoodies, pulling their hoods over their heads during prayers at a crowded service that made repeated reference to Martin's killing as a symptom of the discrimination felt by young black Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacqui Lewis, the church's senior minister, gave a sermon in which she said people were &quot;fed up with centuries of race-related hatred and fear in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not rest until this disease called racism is stamped out,&quot; she said, calling for Americans to mix more frequently with people from different backgrounds, ethnicities and cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She asked congregants to mail packets of Skittles candy to the Sanford Police Department and post pictures of themselves on the Internet wearing their hoodies and holding signs saying: &quot;I am not dangerous. Racism is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was shot dead after Mr. Zimmerman, 28, a white Hispanic neighborhood watch captain, believed the young man walking through the gated community looked suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman followed him and an altercation ensued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends of Mr. Zimmerman, who have not spoken to the media, said he was extremely upset about the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, he took a man's life and he has no idea what to do about it. He's extremely remorseful about it,&quot; said his friend Joe Oliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What makes all these people who are threatening George any better than the person they think he is?&quot; he added. &quot;You've got all these people wanting to lynch the man, and they don't know the whole story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are huge gaps that are being filled in and interpreted without evidence,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A candlelight vigil was planned for Sunday evening in Sanford, where civil rights activist Jesse Jackson was slated to appear. A rally of Martin supporters was also planned in Seattle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford, Florida</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A black political group offered a $10,000 (Bt307,550) reward for the killer of an African-American teenager, amid a nationwide uproar which has prompted a rethink of America's race issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Black Panther Party displayed a wanted poster on its website with a picture of George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer who shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;WANTED!!! For the murder of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin... ALIVE, not dead or harmed,&quot; the poster read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several dozen supporters of the group known by its acronym NBPP &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; unrelated to the revolutionary Black Panther Party active in the 1960s-1980s &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; meanwhile protested for the third time this week at the police headquarters in Sanford, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,&quot; leader Mikhail Muhammad told the Orlando Sentinel. &quot;We don't hate anyone, we hate injustice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activists had called for the mobilisation of 5,000 black men to capture Zimmerman, and Muhammad said the NBPP was receiving donations from black entertainers and athletes, with a goal to collect $1 million this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of demonstrators have marched in at least 10 US cities to express their outrage over the attack, with some of the anger directed at local authorities handling the murder investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have not arrested or charged Zimmerman because he claimed self-defence, which allowed him to benefit from Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law that lets state residents use lethal force when they are at risk of being killed or seriously injured by an assailant. Zimmerman had a permit to carry a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, at least 1,000 protesters &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; many in black hoodies, some with bags of Skittles candy like the one Martin bought before he was shot &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; gathered at Freedom Plaza in the heart of the US capital to demand justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is bigger than you think it is,&quot; said comedian Dick Gregory, an icon of the Civil Rights movement, who suspected that the full story of Martin's death has yet to come to light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must change a society that thinks the black man is a problem,&quot; said Rashawn Davis of the Georgetown University chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford police told AFP they were ignoring the NBPP's call to capture Zimmerman, a white Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the racially charged nature of the case, Zimmerman's lawyer insisted his client was not racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I asked him, 'Are you a racist? Do you have anything against black people?' and he said 'No,'&quot; Zimmerman's legal adviser Craig Sonner told CNN on Friday. &quot;I don't see anything that indicates to me that he's a racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonner said Zimmerman and his wife acted as mentors to two teenage African Americans, even after funding was cut for the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have also helped at a fundraiser for an African-American church, according to the lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama has called for nationwide &quot;soul searching&quot; in the wake of the tragedy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 6:30 p.m., according to the police, Mr. Nunez was part of a group congregating near West 144th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, but broke off and ''began hurriedly walking northbound'' when two uniformed officers approached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the officers followed, the police said, Mr. Nunez turned and fired twice, missing the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One officer returned fire, striking the suspect in the chest and upper thigh, the police said. A .45-caliber Colt 1911 pistol was recovered at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the immediate and somewhat chaotic aftermath of the shooting, some Harlem residents sought to view the shooting in the broader context of race and recent gun violence, recalling the cases of Ramarley Graham, 18, who was fatally shot by a police officer in the Bronx last month, and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, whose death in Florida has set off a national outcry in the weeks since he was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victims in those shootings were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some residents berated officers as they gathered at the scene of the gunfire, apparently unaware of the circumstances of the shooting. One man shouted, ''No justice, no peace!'' -- a phrase repeated often, and conveyed on signs, at recent rallies organized in the Florida teenager's memory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Trayvon will raise the spirits of everyone who is shot like this,'' said one woman, who gave only her first name, Jo. ''But as you can see, it's still going to happen.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami Gardens, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They called him Slimm.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is what Sybrina Fulton, the mother of the slain Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, told me people called her son because he was so thin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I talked with her Saturday in a restaurant near her home, four weeks to the day after George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., shot Trayvon in the chest and killed him. Trayvon was unarmed, carrying nothing more than candy and a drink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Fulton brought her own mother with her, Trayvon's grandmother, and we talked for nearly an hour over iced tea and lukewarm coffee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother lights up when she shows me pictures of Trayvon on her phone, even managing an occasional smile that lifts the shadow of grief and brightens her face. He was a gangly boy, all arms and legs but little weight, nearly six feet three inches tall but only 140 pounds and with the cherubic face of a boy years younger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She grows distant when she talks about her loss, occasionally, seemingly involuntarily, wrapping her hands gently around her mother's arm and resting her head on her mother's shoulder like a young girl in need of comfort. The sorrow seems to come in waves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She and her mother paint a portrait of an all-American boy, one anyone would be proud to call his or her own. He liked sports -- playing and watching -- and going to the mall with his friends. The meal his mother made that he liked most was hamburgers and French fries. ''And brownies,'' his grandmother chimed in, ''with lots of nuts.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was a smart boy who had taken advanced English and math classes, and he planned to go to college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was a hard worker who earned extra money by painting houses, and washing cars and working in the concession of the Pee Wee football league on the weekends. He also baby-sat for his younger cousins, two adorable little girls ages 3 and 7, whom the family called the bunnies, and when he watched the girls he baked them cookies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only fight his mother could ever recall his having was with his own brother when Trayvon was about 4 and the brother was 8. They were fighting for her attention, and it wasn't even a real fight. ''They were wrestling. It was so funny,'' she said with a smile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This hardly fits the profile of a menacing teen who would attack a grown man unprovoked, but that is exactly what Zimmerman contends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's statement, as related by police, says he was following the boy but ''he had lost sight of Trayvon and was returning to his truck to meet the police officer when he says he was attacked by Trayvon.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's personal account of who initiated the physical encounter is forever lost to the grave, but the initiation is likely to be the central question in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To believe Zimmerman's scenario, you have to believe that Trayvon, an unarmed boy, a boy so thin that people called him Slimm, a boy whose mother said that he had not had a fight since he was a preschooler, chose that night and that man to attack. You have to believe that Trayvon chose to attack a man who outweighed him by 100 pounds and who, according to the Sanford police, was wearing his gun in a holster. You have to believe that Trayvon chose to attack even though he was less than a hundred yards from the safety of the home where he was staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is possible, but hardly sounds plausible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key is to determine who was standing his ground and defending himself: the boy with the candy or the man with the gun. Who was winning the fight is a secondary question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, we'll have to wait for details of the investigation to be revealed to know for sure. But while we wait, it is important to not let Trayvon the person be lost to Trayvon the symbol. He was a real boy with a real family that really loved him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now he is gone from his mother forever, only able to stare out at her as a shining face on a cellphone. She has no home videos of Trayvon. She doesn't even have voicemail messages from him saved. The only way that she could now hear Trayvon's voice would be to call his phone and listen to his answering message, but she dare not do it. ''If I hear his voice, I think I'm going to scream.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every night she says she dreams of him. Every morning she says she thinks he's going to walk through the door and say, ''Mom, I'm here. You were dreaming. It's not true. I'm not dead. I'm here,'' and give her a hug and a kiss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the bunnies -- they still don't understand where he is. They're still asking for Trayvon, the cousin who came over and baked them cookies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's now-infamous Stand Your Ground law, which lets you shoot someone you consider threatening without facing arrest, let alone prosecution, sounds crazy -- and it is. And it's tempting to dismiss this law as the work of ignorant yahoos. But similar laws have been pushed across the nation, not by ignorant yahoos but by big corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, language virtually identical to Florida's law is featured in a template supplied to legislators in other states by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a corporate-backed organization that has managed to keep a low profile even as it exerts vast influence (only recently, thanks to yeoman work by the Center for Media and Democracy, has a clear picture of ALEC's activities emerged). And if there is any silver lining to Trayvon Martin's killing, it is that it might finally place a spotlight on what ALEC is doing to our society -- and our democracy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is ALEC? Despite claims that it's nonpartisan, it's very much a movement-conservative organization, funded by the usual suspects: the Kochs, Exxon Mobil, and so on. Unlike other such groups, however, it doesn't just influence laws, it literally writes them, supplying fully drafted bills to state legislators. In Virginia, for example, more than 50 ALEC-written bills have been introduced, many almost word for word. And these bills often become law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many ALEC-drafted bills pursue standard conservative goals: union-busting, undermining environmental protection, tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy. ALEC seems, however, to have a special interest in privatization -- that is, on turning the provision of public services, from schools to prisons, over to for-profit corporations. And some of the most prominent beneficiaries of privatization, such as the online education company K12 Inc. and the prison operator Corrections Corporation of America, are, not surprisingly, very much involved with the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What this tells us, in turn, is that ALEC's claim to stand for limited government and free markets is deeply misleading. To a large extent the organization seeks not limited government but privatized government, in which corporations get their profits from taxpayer dollars, dollars steered their way by friendly politicians. In short, ALEC isn't so much about promoting free markets as it is about expanding crony capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in case you were wondering, no, the kind of privatization ALEC promotes isn't in the public interest; instead of success stories, what we're getting is a series of scandals. Private charter schools, for example, appear to deliver a lot of profits but little in the way of educational achievement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But where does the encouragement of vigilante (in)justice fit into this picture? In part it's the same old story -- the long-standing exploitation of public fears, especially those associated with racial tension, to promote a pro-corporate, pro-wealthy agenda. It's neither an accident nor a surprise that the National Rifle Association and ALEC have been close allies all along.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And ALEC, even more than other movement-conservative organizations, is clearly playing a long game. Its legislative templates aren't just about generating immediate benefits to the organization's corporate sponsors; they're about creating a political climate that will favor even more corporation-friendly legislation in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did I mention that ALEC has played a key role in promoting bills that make it hard for the poor and ethnic minorities to vote?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet that's not all; you have to think about the interests of the penal-industrial complex -- prison operators, bail-bond companies and more. (The American Bail Coalition has publicly described ALEC as its ''life preserver.'') This complex has a financial stake in anything that sends more people into the courts and the prisons, whether it's exaggerated fear of racial minorities or Arizona's draconian immigration law, a law that followed an ALEC template almost verbatim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think about that: we seem to be turning into a country where crony capitalism doesn't just waste taxpayer money but warps criminal justice, in which growing incarceration reflects not the need to protect law-abiding citizens but the profits corporations can reap from a larger prison population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, ALEC isn't single-handedly responsible for the corporatization of our political life; its influence is as much a symptom as a cause. But shining a light on ALEC and its supporters -- a roster that includes many companies, from AT&amp;T and Coca-Cola to UPS, that have so far managed to avoid being publicly associated with the hard-right agenda -- is one good way to highlight what's going on. And that kind of knowledge is what we need to start taking our country back.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dismissal of the undercover detective who fired the first of the 50 police bullets when Sean Bell was killed more than five years ago may close the final chapter of that drawn-out story. But on the Queens streets near the site of Mr. Bell's shooting, residents expressed anger, and resentments that remain unresolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some said it had taken far too long for the New York Police Department to punish the detective, Gescard F. Isnora. Others, still upset that Mr. Isnora and two other detectives were acquitted in a criminal trial in 2008, wondered why the dismissal came just as the killing of a black teenager in Florida was stirring memories of the Bell case. (Mr. Bell was black; Detective Isnora is of Haitian and Mexican descent; and another detective acquitted in the shooting, Marc Cooper, is black.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response among police personnel was more subdued. Many officers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak publicly, said the termination would hurt morale, though some said the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, had no choice but to cut ties to a detective whose name had been tainted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kelly decided to accept the recommendation of an administrative judge who presides over police disciplinary cases that Detective Isnora be terminated, and he forced the retirements of three other officers who were involved in the shooting of Mr. Bell, 23, outside a club on Nov. 25, 2006, his wedding day. On the blocks in Jamaica, Queens, near where Mr. Bell died, there was no shortage of opinions about Mr. Kelly's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's long overdue,'' said Reina Alvarez, 30, a teacher from Rosedale. ''It took too long for those guys to lose their jobs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rodney Travis, 31, who lives two blocks from where the shooting occurred, asked: ''Why now? I don't get it. It takes so long to get justice?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Travis, a nurse's aide, said that he did not think the police had changed their tactics since the Bell shooting, and that officers stop and frisk a lot of local residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I lived in this neighborhood a long time and there's a lot of harassment,'' Mr. Travis said. ''It's a regular thing over here. It's not easy living in a neighborhood like this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marion Spady, 45, a carpenter sitting outside a deli on Sutphin Boulevard, said that in light of the killing of Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watch member in Sanford, Fla., Mr. Kelly's announcement was timed to ''soothe people's minds.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''A lot of people out here feel the New York City police force is overstepping their boundary with a lot of us; Sean Bell; frisking,'' Mr. Spady said. ''They did this to try and get the media off them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip E. Karasyk, a lawyer for Detective Isnora, said, ''The real issue is, why did Commissioner Kelly come to his decision right at this moment, now?'' Mr. Karasyk also noted how slowly Mr. Kelly had moved compared with the administrative judge, who read hundreds of pages of testimony and made a speedy decision. The case went to the judge after his client, Detective Cooper and Detective Michael Oliver were acquitted by a Queens Supreme Court justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kelly and the Police Department have faced strong criticism recently over its stop-and-frisk tactics in minority neighborhoods, its surveillance practices and the fatal police shooting in February of Ramarley Graham, an unarmed teenager, who died in the bathroom of his Bronx home after narcotics officers had trailed him there and kicked down his door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kelly has vigorously defended his policies as the most effective strategy to fight crime, most recently at a combative City Council hearing on March 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One officer said Detective Isnora was guilty of an unforgivable error -- and harmed the careers of his colleagues -- when he opened fire, mistakenly thinking one of the men in Mr. Bell's car had a gun. But others said the department also bore some blame; the detective was trying to do his job and was part of a unit pursuing the managerial objective of detecting illegal behavior in rowdy nightclubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kelly and his police force had at least one defender in Jamaica, a 27-year-old grocery store owner who would identify himself only as Bob.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Fifty shots may not be justified, but you don't know the full story,'' said Bob, who, unlike most of those interviewed in the area, is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You have a vehicle coming at you and you don't know what's going on,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also doubted that Mr. Kelly was motivated by the swelling outrage over the Martin case. ''It's apples and oranges,'' Bob said. ''The cops were looking for criminals in the bar. I don't think it's the same.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The enduring truth is that ''at the end of the day, race will be an issue,'' he said, adding, ''People will still stereotype.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old, was fatally shot on Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla. The next day his death was a top story on the Fox-affiliated television station in Orlando, the closest big city to Sanford. Within a week it was being covered by newspapers around the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it took several weeks before the rest of the country found out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not until mid-March, after word spread on Facebook and Twitter, that the shooting of Trayvon by George Zimmerman, 28, was widely reported by the national news media, highlighting the complex ways that news does and does not travel in the Internet age. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Trayvon's name is known at all is a testament to his family, which hired a tenacious lawyer to pursue legal action and to persuade sympathetic members of the news media to cover the case. Just as important, family members were willing to answer the same painful questions over and over at news conferences and in TV interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notably, many of the national media figures who initially devoted time to the shooting are black, which some journalists and advocacy groups say attests to the need for diversity in newsrooms. The racial and ethnic makeup of newsrooms, where minorities tend to be underrepresented relative to the general population, has long been a source of tension for the news industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''On this story, there is a certain degree of understanding that comes from minorities, and particularly African-Americans, just because we've lived it,'' said Don Lemon, a CNN weekend anchor who has covered the case extensively for the last two weekends. He recalled that in a planning meeting for his program, one of his producers, a black mother of two teenage boys, was ''almost in tears'' as she said, ''We've got to do something on this story.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the case was catapulted onto the national agenda and calls for Mr. Zimmerman's arrest increased, prominent black journalists and commentators wrote about it in highly personal terms. ''This is the fear that seizes me whenever my boys are out in the world: that a man with a gun and an itchy finger will find them 'suspicious,' '' Charles M. Blow of The New York Times wrote on March 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day later, Jonathan Capehart of The Washington Post wrote of the rules he was taught as a teenager: ''Don't run in public,'' ''Don't run while carrying anything in your hands,'' ''Don't talk back to the police.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''One of the burdens of being a black male,'' he wrote, ''is carrying the heavy weight of other people's suspicions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, a volunteer for a neighborhood watch group, has claimed self-defense and has not been charged with any crime, causing an uproar that was readily apparent on social media Web sites. But for the first 10 days after Trayvon's death, the story was covered solely by the Florida media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first national attention appears to have come from CBS News, on March 8, after the network's southeast bureau, based in Atlanta, was tipped off. Mark Strassmann, a correspondent, and Chris St. Peter, a producer, contacted the family's lawyer, Benjamin Crump, and then sent an e-mail suggestion to a group of ''CBS This Morning'' producers. ''We can interview the victims' parents tomorrow,'' they wrote in the e-mail, promising an exclusive. Within 40 minutes, the producers had said yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Strassmann and Mr. St. Peter ''knew a story when they saw it, they sniffed it out, and they did all the legwork,'' said Chris Licht, the executive producer of the morning show and vice president for programming for CBS News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on March 8, The Huffington Post and TheGrio.com, an arm of NBC News, covered the case. By the end of the week, CNN and its sister channel HLN were also on the story, as were some black radio hosts and bloggers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National coverage increased somewhat the week of March 12, but really intensified only after March 16, when tapes of 911 calls were released, showing that Mr. Zimmerman had been told by a dispatcher that he did not need to follow Trayvon. Having the audio -- which the police had previously declined to release -- was critical because it gave radio and TV reporters more material for their segments and because it aroused more suspicion about Mr. Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within days of the national media scrutiny, the Justice Department said it would investigate the case, and on March 23, President Obama addressed it directly, furthering the media dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some reporters and anchors, like Mr. Lemon and Mr. Blow, said they were urged by their followers on Facebook and Twitter to find out about the shooting -- evidence of the effect that the Web can have on news coverage. ''People started sending me tweets saying, 'What are you going to say about this case?' '' Mr. Blow recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then looked up local stories about it, contacted Mr. Crump, and arranged for an interview with Trayvon's mother, Sybrina Fulton. ''They were very open to talking, and that was very important,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On television, the family spoke early and often to the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist who has radio shows and an MSNBC television show. He was made aware of the shooting by Mr. Crump, who had previously enlisted Mr. Sharpton to speak out against the death of a Florida boy at a boot camp in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The attorney called and said, 'I need you again,' '' Mr. Sharpton recalled in a telephone interview from Florida, where he staged a rally Thursday night to call for justice. He took his radio and TV shows with him, thereby amplifying his call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sharpton has used his shows for all manner of advocacy He analogized radio, with its hours of airtime and calls from listeners, to ''ground forces'' and MSNBC as ''air strikes'' and said, ''If you have a war, you're going to need both.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Crump has publicly thanked the media for paying attention, and so, too, has the family. Trayvon's father, Tracy, told Gayle King on CBS last Friday, ''The world knows Trayvon now.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Primary by primary, Newt Gingrich's reasons for remaining in the presidential race keep getting knocked down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where once he saw a path to the nomination through the South, he has suffered a string of embarrassing losses there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, he made a case that by picking up delegates even in states he did not win, he could stop Mitt Romney from clinching the nomination before the Republican National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that argument, too, is unraveling after Mr. Gingrich won so few votes in the two big contests last week, Illinois and Louisiana, that he was shut out of delegates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But humiliation has not changed his will to stay in the race, and now he has advanced another rationale -- he can exert leverage over policy debates, in his party as well as in countering President Obama, who Mr. Gingrich is convinced has been forced to go on the defensive over gasoline prices precisely because of his attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I have no incentive to get out of the race,'' Mr. Gingrich said before finishing a distant third in Louisiana, with 16 percent of the vote, despite campaigning there most of last week. ''I have every incentive to talk about big ideas and watch Obama dance on energy. Where was the energy issue three weeks ago before I started talking about it?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Gingrich's increasingly quirky campaign is in danger of descending into irrelevancy, at least as far as the Republican nomination is concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He harbors a vision in which there is a floor fight at the nominating convention in August and he emerges the choice of the conservative base. He has taken to citing as a precedent the 1920 convention that chose Warren G. Harding on the 10th ballot -- a far-fetched set of circumstances for a modern political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Mr. Gingrich drove two hours south of New Orleans along bayous and down lonely causeways to a major oil port, where only 25 voters turned out to hear him speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His main reason for going, he acknowledged, was to use the national news media to paint the president as an obstacle to offshore drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that may explain Mr. Gingrich's true reason for remaining in the race: it keeps him in the spotlight. He clearly relishes the appearances on CNN with Piers Morgan and on Fox News with Sean Hannity. When he travels, a 10-car motorcade conveys him like a head of state, three police cars with flashing lights leading a Secret Service detail and shiny S.U.V.'s for Mr. Gingrich and his staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a candidate, his opinion is sought as major news of the day. Most recently, he made some provocative comments while discussing Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the black teenager fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr. Obama said that if he had a son, ''he'd look like Trayvon,'' Mr. Gingrich, in a radio interview, called the comment ''disgraceful.'' He implied that the president had injected race where it did not belong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, a senior White House adviser, David Plouffe, called Mr. Gingrich's remarks ''reprehensible.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Speaker Gingrich is clearly in the last throes of his political career,'' Mr. Plouffe said on ''This Week'' on ABC. ''You can make a decision whether to go out with some shred of dignity or say these irresponsible, reckless things.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior adviser to Mr. Gingrich pushed back on the suggestion that Mr. Gingrich was still in the race to maintain his place in the spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The naysayers and critics and their shopworn cliches about why he can't continue is actually oxygen for him,'' said the adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet that exposure is waning. Mr. Gingrich's full-time traveling press corps is down to a handful of embedded television reporters. Politico and one of the last print reporters departed after Louisiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money has become a serious issue. The Gingrich campaign reported it had only $1.5 million on hand at the end of February and owed more than that, while fund-raising has been tailing off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite the pressures, Mr. Gingrich seems to be enjoying himself campaigning again. Gone are the desultory stump speeches he gave in Alabama and Mississippi earlier in the month, when he seemed weary and discouraged after winning only a single state, Georgia, on Super Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm cheerful about going forward,'' he said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His schedule has taken on an unhurried pace and easygoing style. He spent several minutes exchanging restaurant tips with reporters the other day, describing a dinner at Cochon in Lafayette, La., as ''spectacular.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And speaking to students later that day at Tulane, where he got his Ph.D., Mr. Gingrich reminisced fondly, mimicking a German-accented professor he had and extolling ''the experience of New Orleans -- the culture, the history, the sense of life the city has.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, he dropped by the house he and his first wife occupied near the Audubon Zoo, a favorite destination, which he took time out to visit during a break from campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the campaign announced a schedule for the coming week in which Mr. Gingrich would visit Delaware, North Carolina and the sites of the next three primaries, on April 3: Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not long ago, Mr. Gingrich was asked by Charlie Rose on CBS whether there were any circumstances under which he would suspend his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Probably none,'' he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Manhattan worshippers yesterday joined churchgoers across America in donning hoodies to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed black teen blown away by a Florida cop wannabe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Middle Collegiate Church in the East Village was filled to capacity - with almost everyone in the racially mixed audience wearing hoodies such as the one Martin had on when he was shot,  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We are all in hoodies today to say, 'I'm not dangerous - racism is,' &quot; said Minister Jacqui Lewis. &quot;Every Sunday, I'm going to wear my hoodie until justice is done.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Martin, 17, was killed Feb. 26 in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., by volunteer neighborhood-watch captain George Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The teen had left his dad's girlfriend's house in the neighborhood to buy Skittles and a can of iced tea at a local store before the NBA All-Star game started on TV. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   At Hartford Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit, the Rev. Charles Adams approached the pulpit with iced tea and Skittles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Mr. Zimmerman was so worried about burglars that he became a thief that stole a human life,&quot; Adams said, according to the Detroit News. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Florida cops so far have refused to arrest Zimmerman, buying his self-defense claim. State and federal prosecutors are looking into the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A witness to the shooting's aftermath said Zimmerman did nothing to help Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We heard the gunshot, [and my roommate and I] both saw him straddling the body, basically a foot on both sides of Trayvon's body, and his hands pressed on his back,&quot; Mary Cutcher told NBC's &quot;Dateline'' in an interview aired last night.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Zimmerman never turned him over or tried to help him or [administer] CPR or anything.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, another neighbor, Frank Taaffe, insisted Zimmerman never acted like &quot;Charles Bronson or Rambo'' around the community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He wasn't Bernhard Goetz trying to jump on the subway looking for trouble,'' Taaffe said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Referring to TV's &quot;Andy Griffith Show,'' about small-town cops, Taaffe added, &quot;George was a cross between Barney Fife and Andy of Maybury.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman's lawyer insisted his client was only protecting himself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;George Zimmerman suffered a broken nose, an injury - a gash - to the back of his head,&quot; said lawyer Craig Sonner. &quot;He claims that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin struck him, and he went down.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even the Florida rep who wrote the state's &quot;Stand Your Ground'' law, which Zimmerman is using to defend himself, did not appear convinced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the &quot;Dateline'' reporter noted that &quot;trained police investigators . . . determined no crime was committed [by Zimmerman],'' Republican legislator Dennis Baxley replied, &quot;I think they're wrong.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman has been in hiding. A friend said the shooter cried for days after the deadly incident. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He couldn't stop crying. He's a caring human being,&quot; said the pal, former TV news reporter Joe Oliver. &quot;I mean, he took a man's life, and he has no idea what to do about it. He's extremely remorseful about it.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAYTONA BEACH -- Area resident Sharonda Elliott didn't know Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the black teenager whose death last month in Sanford has sparked national outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, died after being shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in a gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elliott said she can relate to the pain Martin's family must be feeling following the senseless death of a love one. Her brother Bruce Johnson was killed in 2002. No one has been arrested in that case, according to Elliott. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm saddened by it (referring to Martin's death) and for the family,&quot; she said after Sunday school at Greater Friendship Baptist Church on George W. Engram Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I really think that it was a crime based on color,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So does the Rev. L. Ronald Durham, pastor at Greater Friendship and organizer of a march last week in Sanford calling for the arrest of Zimmerman, 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence seems to indicate that Zimmerman perpetuated a deliberate hate crime,&quot; Durham said in his remarks Sunday during church service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who has been described as a Hispanic, maintains that he was defending himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police reports indicate Martin did not have a weapon. He was returning from a convenience store carrying only a bag of Skittles and a can of iced tea. Zimmerman is heard on 9-1-1 tapes describing the boy as &quot;suspicious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every so often in America, there comes a tragedy that exposes America's most senseless fault lines,&quot; Durham told the congregation Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He chastised the media for initially ignoring the story, the national gun lobby for its role in the proliferation of guns in America, and state lawmakers who pushed through the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law which allows Florida residents to defend themselves with deadly force in certain situations. Some have suggested that it may have played an underlying role in what happened to Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the big &quot;elephant in the room,&quot; Durham said, remains race and Americans reluctance to talk about it. If the shooter were black and the victim white, he said, police would have taken a different tack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until we get to the real underlying issue in this country, we will never solve the problem and race is the problem in America today,&quot; Durham said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Steven Robinson , another member of the congregation, agreed there were racial overtones in Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do think that race played a part in the overall investigation of Martin's death. It is an unfortunate reality in our society,&quot; Robinson said, adding a full investigation is necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due process. That is what people are calling for and no matter how the case ends up, there needs to be a thorough investigation and not just take the word of Zimmerman,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both a state grand jury and the U.S. Department of Justice have announced plans to review the case. Church member Arthur Harper, meanwhile, said he was puzzled why police did not take Zimmerman into custody or take his weapon. He noted that when police officers are involved in questionable shootings, they are subject to being put on leave pending an investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He (Zimmerman) killed somebody and nothing was said. It looks racial to me. We might not have all the facts but it seems to point that way,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday was Youth Sunday at Greater Friendship and at least a dozen people wore hooded sweatshirts in remembrance of Martin, who was wearing one when he was killed Feb. 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durham asked them to stand. He warned them as well as other young people present to be careful when they do simple things such as walking down the street, reaching into a pocket to get identification card and even reaching under the seat in a car when stopped by law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your life may be at risk if you are in the wrong place talking to the wrong person,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEVELOPMENTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B-CU MARCHES FOR MARTIN: Students at Bethune-Cookman University plan a march for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin at 4:30 p.m. today from the university quad to First Baptist Church of Daytona Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS: Top presidential adviser David Plouffe says President Barack Obama's decision to comment on the shooting death of an African-American teenager in Florida was motivated by parental instinct more than the incident's emergence as a racial issue. He says Obama reacted instinctively as a parent last week in saying that Americans needed &quot;some soul searching&quot; in the wake of the slaying.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON: Members of the New Black Panther Party are offering a $US10,000 ($A9660) reward for the capture of George Zimmerman, the Neighbourhood Watch volunteer who shot dead teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Black Panther leader Mikhail Muhammad announced the reward during a protest in Sanford, Florida, on Saturday. And when asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly: ``An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bounty announcement came after members of the group called for the mobilisation of 10,000 black men to capture Zimmerman, who shot Martin in a gated Sanford community on February 26. Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland, where the 28-year-old worked before the shooting, employees there told The Orlando Sentinel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford city officials issued a statement late on Saturday, condemning the group's appeal and asking citizens to leave all arrests to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The city is requesting calm heads and no vigilante justice,'' the statement said. ``Attempts by civilians to take any person into custody may result in criminal charges or unnecessary violence.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Orange-Osceola County prosecutor Esther Whitehead said the Panthers' bounty opened them up to civil and criminal liability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I can't see how anyone can go out and take action as a private citizen without some government action like the issuance of a warrant,'' she said. ``It doesn't make sense. It doesn't sound reasonable.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Black Panthers were in Sanford on Saturday for the group's third protest in the past two weeks over the fatal shooting of the Miami Gardens teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammed led the small group in chanting ``Justice for Trayvon!'' and ``Black Power!'' ``If the government won't do the job, we'll do it,'' he said, leading his group of eight party members in chants like ``freedom or death'' and ``justice for Trayvon'' while making the iconic gesture of raising their fists into the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pastor Moses Brown, of Tampa, said he was disappointed with the New Black Panthers' approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We believe in a message of justice, not hate,'' said Brown, who was in town to pray at the memorial. ``We believe justice will come through the court system.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month's fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a neighborhood watch volunteer outside Orlando was a tragedy, worshippers at local black churches said Sunday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also said it's a travesty that the shooter, George Zimmerman, was neither arrested nor charged in the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For them not to arrest him, that's my problem,&quot; West Palm Beach resident Alberta Hollis said before services at Redemptive Life Fellowship on North Australian Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been listening to the case all week. They're not arresting him because they said they weren't supposed to. I'm really grieved by this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's outrageous,&quot; added a woman who also worships at Redemptive Life and who asked not to be identified. &quot;I'm just shocked that this man should still be at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no explanation. Not even racism will explain it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has sparked a nationwide furor since it unfolded Feb. 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police, Martin, wearing a hooded sweatshirt, was returning to his father's home in a gated community in Sanford, 20 miles northeast of Orlando, after buying Skittles candy and a canned iced tea from a convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who was patrolling the neighborhood, saw Martin and called 911 because he thought the teenager looked suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He followed Martin despite being advised against it by a dispatcher. An encounter ensued, and Martin was discovered later shot to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who claimed self-defense in the shooting, has not been charged with a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That fact saddens the Rev. Kevin Jones, a youth minister with Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church in West Palm Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's just disappointing to hear that they're not really going through with the due process,&quot; Jones said. &quot;To not arrest this man is just distasteful, just dishonorable. It really hurts my heart. We're about encouraging and raising up our young men to be godly men. To see this happen is definitely disheartening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 200 people took part in a march Sunday afternoon that began at Currie Park in West Palm Beach and continued to the county courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tabernacle Missionary will hold a justice rally at 6:30 tonight at the church at 801 Eighth St. Representatives of 26 congregations are expected to attend. The public is invited.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Alyce Koruna </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I woke up around 3 one morning last week and could not go back to sleep. One chilling reminder stood out from the news: &quot;Our son is your son.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were the powerful words of the mother of slain Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. They warned parents of African American boys of the danger our sons face for a new and preposterous crime: &quot;walking while black.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a decade ago, I worried and wrote about a similar danger my young sons faced for &quot;driving while black.&quot; The nation and the region were learning about the ugly practice of racial profiling by police. New Jersey's state troopers were embroiled in a controversy over the shooting of four minority kids who were on their way to a college basketball tryout. The case opened the floodgates for a national conversation about racial profiling and its place - if any - in police work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also reinforced for black parents the importance of teaching children - especially boys, who are in the greatest jeopardy - police etiquette: &quot;Keep your hands on the steering wheel.&quot; &quot;Inform the officer of what you are going to do before you do it.&quot; &quot;Use standard English.&quot; The idea was to teach them to leave their pride at the door in the interest of coming back home alive. I succeeded in teaching these and other lessons to my boys, now 16 and 18, one of them driving and the other studying for his permit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My insomnia the other night stemmed from a new worry: armed, racial-profiling vigilantes under police protection. Sound far-fetched? Perhaps, but Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents had to suffer a second blow when their son's death at the hands of a civilian did not lead to a prompt police response. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman saw a black youth in his Florida neighborhood and took it upon himself to question him. Frank Taaffe, defending his fellow neighborhood watchman, said all Martin had to do was answer Zimmerman's questions. The suggestion is that almost anyone has the right to question young men - perhaps my young men - simply for walking around wearing the clothing of their time (Martin's hooded sweatshirt was cited as suspect) and the skin color they were born with. And if their questions aren't answered, they somehow have the right to use deadly force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Florida's policing so inadequate that neighborhood watchers cannot simply call 911 and report &quot;suspicious&quot; people? And why are vigilantes carrying guns? I don't know people who walk around with guns who aren't looking for something violent to happen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does this type of behavior occur in the Delaware Valley? Could it happen in Buckingham or Morrisville, where my kids spend their time? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practices revealed by this shooting are even more repugnant than those that surfaced in New Jersey 13 years ago. This can happen again if we let it, and next time it could be my child who gets in trouble simply for walking while black. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoodies have endured a bad rap for some time now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet last week, given the death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin a month ago, the hooded sweatshirt became the most politicized garment of its era as Americans - especially black men - held rallies to end racial profiling and to take the hoodie back. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wear a hoodie almost every day,&quot; Drexel University student James Moore, 27, said at the Million Hoodie March in Philadelphia on Friday, which drew an estimated 5,000 protesters - black and white, most of them wearing hoodies.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon wasn't killed because he was wearing a hoodie; he was killed because he was black. The hoodie is just a symbol,&quot; Moore said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was wearing a hoodie pulled up over his head when he was shot and killed by Neighborhood Watch participant George Zimmerman on Feb. 26 as the teen walked back to his father's house in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., from a convenience store. The unarmed Martin was carrying a bag of Skittles candy and a container of iced tea. Police, who had possession of Martin's cellphone after he was killed, did not notify his family. No charges have been filed against Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many say Zimmerman, 28, who has a white father and Hispanic mother, would not have targeted Martin if the teen had been white and wearing a hoodie. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet talk show host Geraldo Rivera argued that Martin was partly responsible for his death because he was wearing a hoodie. Rivera's comments have drawn rebuke, even from his own son. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appearance of racial profiling in the case has evoked renewed fear among the parents, relatives, and friends of black and biracial boys. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A white boy wears a hoodie and he's a college student; a black man wears a hoodie and he's a professional thug,&quot; said Chuck Williams, director of Drexel University's Center for the Prevention of School-Aged Violence. &quot;This apparel makes me a criminal, and I am in their eyes. What I wear gives them an excuse to do what they want to me.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence the spreading call to hoodie action, which started over Facebook and Twitter and gained momentum in the last week as celebrities from singer Common to the entire Miami Heat basketball team released photos of themselves wearing hoodies. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams even donned a black hoodie and posted on Facebook a photo of himself wearing it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philadelphia's march Friday followed similar events in New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. And the protests show no sign of slowing. Hoodie candlelight vigils are scheduled for LOVE Park on Monday and Thursday. On Sunday, protesters in hoodies plan to gather at Temple University. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents of black children who once warned them to keep their hoodies down so they would not be wrongfully profiled are now saying enough is enough. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I urge all parents to tell their children to wear hoodies as much as they can. What are they going to do, shoot all of them?&quot; asked Reggie Jones, 40, father of a 23-year-old son, who attended the march Friday with his wife and daughter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even African American churches, where conservatively dressed members typically speak out against the fashions inspired by hip-hop culture, are getting involved in the hoodie protest. On Sunday, more than 30 men at Mount Zion United Methodist Church wore hoodies at their annual Men's Day service in memory of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to stop allowing people to tell us what we can and can't wear,&quot; said the Rev. Micah Sims, who helped organize the protest. &quot;It's not about what we wear; it's about who we are.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African American men are arguably the nation's biggest tastemakers. Often, they take a piece of classic American clothing and put a twist on it. And the way they wear it becomes a trend that mainstream America copies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoodies popped into mainstream culture when Sylvester Stallone made them popular in Rocky. But hoodies did not become really cool until hip-hop artists such as Run DMC and the Wu-Tang Clan proudly rocked and rapped about them. Eventually, hoodies came to be featured in every hip-hop clothing line, from Phat Farm to Rocawear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what often happens is that while mainstream America gets points for cool, even appropriating the looks for the runway, black men get labeled sinister for wearing the trend they created. Masculine white guys are trendy; masculine black men are feared. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That became more true with hip-hop culture as everything from Timberland boots to white T-shirts to sports jerseys reached the heights of fashion in the black community but also become ways to profile black men. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We live in a society where people are more likely to assume a young black man is a criminal,&quot; said James Peterson, professor of history at Lehigh University. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's in our music. In our TV. It's how it's reported on film, video games, and it has fueled certain sartorial prejudices that rear their head in the form of racial profiling.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So black parents find themselves having to tell their children they can't do what everyone else is doing because they will be perceived negatively. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unlike sagging jeans and tattoos, which often are considered slovenly and threatening, nothing could be more all-American than a hoodie. Not just the uniform of hip-hop, they are preferred apparel at sporting events and as comfort wear. President George W. Bush was often photographed jogging in his. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the early part of the millennium, they were at their peak, spurred by Pharrell Williams' wearing bright Bathing Ape hoodies and the rise of Juicy Couture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fashions change, and slowly but surely hip-hop artists began wearing their hoodies up. As did skateboarders and even Olympic athletes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for black men, the hoodie had become criminalized, as did any black man - or teen - wearing one. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Material culture for other races is tangential,&quot; Peterson said. &quot;Unfortunately, material culture for black folks can be life or death.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Philadelphia prepares for another demonstration over the shooting death in Florida of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Mayor Nutter on Sunday called the killing an &quot;assassination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nutter also joined the increasing calls for the arrest of 28-year-old George Zimmerman, the Neighborhood Watch volunteer who fatally shot the unarmed Martin in February. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nutter delivered his comments on MSNBC a day before the one-month anniversary of the shooting, which will be marked Monday night with a candlelight vigil in LOVE Park, the latest in a series of demonstrations in various U.S. cities.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Participants are encouraged to wear hooded sweatshirts, or hoodies, because Martin was wearing one when he was killed. A Million Hoodie March in Philadelphia on Friday attracted as many as 5,000 participants by some estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I've called this nothing short of an assassination,&quot; Nutter said in a nationally televised interview with MSNBC's Alex Witt, echoing earlier comments he had made in local television interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This individual Zimmerman followed Trayvon for some period of time. Trayvon was not doing anything . . . was not a threat based on all the information and evidence and 911 tapes that have been released,&quot; Nutter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the recording of a 911 call Zimmerman made before the shooting, he tells the dispatcher a teenager - who he said looked like &quot;a real suspicious guy&quot; - had started running. The dispatcher asked Zimmerman whether he was following the young man. When he said he was, the dispatcher told Zimmerman not to. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Clearly, Zimmerman was told not to continue any kind of pursuit,&quot; Nutter said on MSNBC. &quot;In my view . . . he tracked him down. He followed him and then shot and killed him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On at least one 911 call neighbors made, a male voice is crying in distress just before the fatal gunshot rings out. It is unclear who was crying out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an Inquirer interview Sunday, Nutter said he had not spoken to investigators in Sanford, the small town where the shooting occurred, or any other officials - including those in the U.S. Justice Department who are now probing the killing. He also said he had not spoken with any of Martin's relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nutter said he formed his opinions about the case based on the extensive media coverage. He also referred to a cellphone conversation between Martin and the young man's girlfriend during which Martin said a man was following him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If things went down the way it's been reported, then, I'll say again, that is tantamount to an assassination,&quot; Nutter said in the Inquirer interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Feb. 26, Martin was walking back from a 7-Eleven store to his father's house in a gated community to watch a basketball game when Zimmerman followed and shot him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman has contended he fired in self-defense, relying on a Florida law that allows a person to &quot;stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force,&quot; if he or she thinks death or bodily harm is imminent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the time of the shooting, Martin was carrying a bag of Skittles candy and a container of iced tea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public condemnation of how authorities in Florida have handled the case - they have not arrested Zimmerman - has been unrelenting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critics maintained that Martin's race - African American - played a factor in his shooting. Zimmerman's ethnic background is mixed; he has a white father and Hispanic mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of Zimmerman's friends have come to his defense, saying that he is not a racist and that he feared for his life that night. The neighborhood had been hit by a string of burglaries committed by young black males, according to media reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nutter's comments underscore how much the case has enraged people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Inquirer interview, Nutter said, &quot;Clearly, there must be some seriously unanswered questions&quot; if the Justice Department has initiated a probe, President Obama has spoken about the shooting, and thousands have demonstrated across the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need to know what happened. Why it happened. Why this individual has not yet been arrested,&quot; Nutter said on MSNBC. &quot;Almost a month to the day of this incredible tragedy, he's still running around free, and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Justice Department probe seeks, in part, to determine whether a hate crime was committed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On one of Zimmerman's 911 calls to police the night of the shooting, he muttered something under his breath that to some sounded like a racial slur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The uproar over the police handling of the case has forced the temporary resignation of the police chief in Sanford. The state attorney for Seminole County has also agreed to remove himself from the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There was a young boy who was minding his business, a young African American male . . . good kid based on everything that we know, and this guy on his own shoots him down with no logic, no reason, and no response from the law enforcement officials down in Florida,&quot; Nutter said on MSNBC. &quot;People are not going to stand for this.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAST I checked, the city's homicide rate stood at a disgraceful grand total of 84 for the first three months of 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's practically one a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not to take anything away from the hoodie rallies and marches around the country protesting the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed, black Florida teen killed last month while returning home after buying Skittles and iced tea, but where's the outrage for the homicidal madness that passes as everyday life right here in Philadelphia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A senseless shooting like what happened to Trayvon is something we all should stand up and protest against. It's outrageous that George Zimmerman, a neighborhood-watch captain who admitted killing Trayvon, hasn't been taken into custody. I agree with Mayor Nutter, who called this &quot;nothing short of an assassination.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Philadelphians are fired up. An estimated 2,500 people turned out Friday for the Hoodie March in Center City. Churchgoers donned hoodies yesterday in honor of Trayvon. In the 20-plus years that I've called this city my home, I've never seen Philadelphians as riled up about a single murder as they are in this case. But it gives me pause that we don't direct the same level of outrage at some of the incidents that take place closer to home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'm not saying don't grab a hoodie and head to the rally tonight at LOVE Park. I plan on stopping by myself. And I'll be wearing a hoodie, too. However, as we agitate for justice for Trayvon, let's also remember the many local victims who've recently lost their lives in senseless displays of recklessness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Take the case of the beautiful ballet dancer from Bulgaria struck by a hit-and-run driver in the wee hours of March 18. Only 22, Polina Kadiyska had left her homeland to study at the Rock School for Dance Education. She had worked a side job and was leaving a Chinese takeout about 4 a.m. when she was struck at Broad and Ellsworth streets by a car that blew through a red light. She died two days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the same day that Kadiyska was struck, the life of a Good Samaritan in North Philly was about to end as well. Rafael Santiago Delvalle was inside La Familia Mini Market in North Philly when a masked gunman burst in and engaged in a gunbattle with the store's owner. After his friend was wounded, Delvalle picked up the store owner's weapon and took off after the gunman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No doubt, Delvalle was acting on adrenaline and didn't realize he was being followed. An accomplice shot Delvalle in the back and reportedly stood over him as he shot him in the head. Devalle died at the scene. He was only 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, authorities are still investigating the case of the two teenagers gunned down recently while joyriding on a stolen all-terrain vehicle on 9th Street near Cambria. Police say Dexter Bowie, 17, and Johnathan Stokley, 18, were shot with at least 30 rounds from an AK-47 assault rifle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An AK-47. Neither were innocents, but they were both just kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I could go on and on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But back to Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His death a month ago hits us hard because it's a reminder of how vulnerable our loved ones can be, especially when they're racially profiled, as it's believed Trayvon was. I have a 19-year-old nephew who wears hoodies to class at Drexel University, and I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I'm scared that someone may target him. He could be Trayvon. Lots of folks, including the president, feel that same nervousness. &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; President Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But let's also not forget that Kadiyska, the ballerina from Bulgaria, could have been our friend. And Delvalle, the Good Samaritan, might have been our next-door neighbor. And the two bullet-ridden young men on the stolen ATV could have been our kids' classmates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not to take as much as a Skittle away from Trayvon, but aren't these people's untimely deaths worth our getting worked up about as well?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the New York Times article &quot;Self-Defense Law Is Under the Gun after Fla. Killing,&quot; printed in the PG March 21, I am unsure of the journalist's motive to label George Zimmerman, the shooter, as a white Hispanic. Are we at the level of detail now in which our grand rainbow society must endure further classifications such as black-white, black-Hispanic, Hispanic-white, white-Indian, Hispanic-Indian, etc.? Is the article trying to imply because he is part white he may be racist and therefore shot a black teenager? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To me it looks like you have a neighborhood watch guy who decided to step into a role of a professional policeman, a position that Mr. Zimmerman was ill-trained to do, which resulted in him becoming a vigilante. A beautiful human being, Trayvon Martin, was killed. Then a brain-dead system allows Mr. Zimmerman to walk under Florida's self-defense law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's hope the blind lady of justice will have the final word and reporters can continue to classify people to suit their fancy or view of the world.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- With a single punch, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin decked the neighborhood watch volunteer who eventually shot to death the unarmed 17-year-old, then Trayvon climbed on top of George Zimmerman and slammed his head into the sidewalk several times, leaving him bloody and battered, authorities have revealed to The Orlando Sentinel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the account Zimmerman gave police, and much of it has been corroborated by witnesses, authorities say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has not spoken publicly about what happened, but that night, Feb. 26, and in later meetings he described and re-enacted for police what he says happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his version of events, he had turned around and was walking back to his SUV when Trayvon approached him from behind, the two exchanged words then Trayvon punched him in the nose, sending him to the ground, and began beating him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told police he shot the teenager in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders and thousands of others have demanded Zimmerman's arrest, calling Trayvon a victim of racial profiling and Zimmerman a vigilante.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was an unarmed black teenager who had committed no crime, they say, who was gunned down while walking back from a 7-Eleven with nothing more sinister than a package of Skittles and can of Arizona iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters have held rallies in Sanford, Miami, New York and Tallahassee, calling the case a tragic miscarriage of injustice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton headlined a rally in Sanford Thursday that drew an estimated 8,000 people. The Rev. Jesse Jackson Sunday spoke at an Eatonville, Fla., church, where he called Trayvon a martyr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has gone into hiding. A fringe group, the New Black Panthers, have offered a $10,000 reward for his capture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have been reluctant to provided details about all their evidence, but this is what they've disclosed to the Sentinel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was on his way to the grocery store when he spotted Trayvon walking through his gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was visiting his father's fiancee, who lived there. He had been suspended from school in Miami after being found with an empty marijuana baggie. Miami schools have a zero-tolerance policy for drug possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman called police and reported a suspicious person, describing Trayvon as black, acting strangely and perhaps on drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman got out of his SUV to follow Trayvon on foot. When a dispatch employee asked Zimmerman if he was following the 17-year-old, Zimmerman said yes. The dispatcher told Zimmerman he did not need to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is about a one-minute gap during which police say they're not sure what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told them he lost sight of Trayvon and was walking back to his SUV when Trayvon approached him from the left rear, and they exchanged words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon asked Zimmerman if he had a problem. Zimmerman said no and reached for his cell phone, he told police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon then said, &quot;Well, you do now&quot; or something similar and punched Zimmerman in the nose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman fell to the ground and Trayvon got on top of him and began slamming his head into the sidewalk, he told police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman began yelling for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several witnesses heard those cries, and there has been a dispute about from whom they came: Zimmerman or Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for Trayvon's family say it was Trayvon, but police say their evidence indicates it was Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One witness, who has since talked to local television news reporters, told police he saw Zimmerman on the ground with Trayvon on top, pounding him and was unequivocal that it was Zimmerman who was crying for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman then shot Trayvon once in the chest from very close range, according to authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police arrived less than two minutes later, Zimmerman was bleeding from the nose, had a swollen lip and had bloody lacerations to the back of his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paramedics gave him first aid, but he said no to going to the hospital. He got medical care the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Justice last week opened a civil rights investigation into what happened, and Florida Gov. Rick Scott appointed a special prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not clear whether the special prosecutor, Angela Corey, the state attorney for Duval, Clay and Nassau counties, will have Zimmerman arrested, announce that there's not enough evidence to file a manslaughter charge or present evidence to a grand jury.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: Americans are rightfully outraged and demanding justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the 17-year old boy shot and killed by a self-appointed neighborhood watchman, George Zimmerman. All the evidence that has surfaced thus far, including the recording of the police dispatcher who specifically forbade Zimmerman from taking the law into his own hands, points to a hate crime. Martin was not armed but merely returning home clutching a snack. It is incomprehensible how the slaying of Martin could be defended by the Sanford Police Department and smacks of blatant racism.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The enactment of the &quot;stand your ground,&quot; shoot-first law in Florida and other states will turn our nation into gun-toting Charlie Bronsons bent on seeking instant justice down the barrel of a gun. This law provides complete protection to vigilantes wanting to settle scores, and is another example of the power of the National Rifle Association -- aided by its political lackeys -- whose only interest is to maximize its profits to the detriment of our society.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have-nots have the power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: President Barack Obama's claims that his past actions rescued the economy are just as baseless as Mitt Romney's promises that lowering taxes on the rich will lead to employment and prosperity for all. Nobody believes either of them. We essentially have a race between two witch doctors attempting to conjure rain with nothing more than elaborate rain dances and veiled incitement to class hatred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as Romney seems to be tongue-tied when it comes to explaining why it is &quot;fair&quot; to tax capital gains at only 15 percent, so is Obama when it comes to explaining why it is &quot;fair&quot; to tax those who make more than $250,000 as the universal solution for all our income needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The simple fact is that the balance of power in the U.S. has already tilted in favor of the have-nots, of those who have no considerable savings or assets and therefore have not much at stake if the taxes rise or if the currency falls. Those who have something to lose and thus worry about our future fiscal solvency are already in a minority and tied in religious knots by the likes of Rick Santorum or savant idiots like Newt Gingrich. Our near future is clear: Miserable benefits for all, as our much-reviled golden goose will be plucked by the have-nots within an inch of its life, and then some.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: It is outrageous that the United States is paying $50,000 for each Afghan killed and $11,000 for each person wounded in the shooting rampage earlier this month. Instead, they should be paying us for each person murdered and wounded in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and if they are unhappy with us being in their country, then don't attack us and not expect us to unleash a big can of American retaliation. To any Arab leaders unhappy with the turmoil unleashed due to the actions of their own people, clean up your own act and get your own citizens in line.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: Mandate or not to mandate, that is the health care question of the week. Are we losing our freedoms, as the conservatives claim, or are we just fixing a societal problem with the best tools available? You can try to comprehend the legalese by watching C-SPAN or you can rely on a fairly simple approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I look at the reality, which is that someone in need of serious medical care cannot be turned away from a hospital emergency room. The Islamo, Judeo, Christian background of our culture mandates that these needs be met. That resolves the question nicely as far as I can see. The mandate already exists. Now it is only a question of reasonable payment and how to collect it. Requiring all citizens to provide for a payment mechanism for themselves and their dependants seems hardly a stretch, as our nation has already mandated the delivery of health care. There, that wasn't so hard. Was it?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- Dozens of men and women gathered outside Oakland City Hall on Monday to add their voices to those across the nation demanding the arrest and prosecution of the man who shot black Florida teenager Trayvon Martin one month ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of those who rallied wore &quot;hoodies&quot; similar to the sweatshirt that the 17-year-old Martin was wearing when George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, shot and killed him following a confrontation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 28, said he acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Martin's family said the unarmed teenager was a victim of profiling, prompting a national outcry and debate on race that has stretched from the White House to Frank H. Ogawa Plaza and elsewhere in the Bay Area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His life was robbed because of suspicion and perception,&quot; Dr. Charley Hames, pastor of BeeBe Memorial Cathedral in Oakland, said at the Oakland rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with wearing hoodies, some protesters brought Skittles candy and cans of iced tea. Martin was carrying the items when he was shot as he headed back from a convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It reminds me of Emmett Till,&quot; said Sharlana Turner, 25, of Berkeley, referring to the African-American boy who was murdered in Mississippi in August 1955. &quot;It's a continuing cycle of no justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was heading to a grocery store in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26 when he spotted Martin and called police to report him as suspicious. Zimmerman stepped out of his SUV to follow Martin, despite a police dispatcher discouraging him, according to published reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told police that he briefly lost sight of Martin and was returning to his vehicle when the teenager confronted and attacked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kareem Marshall, 25, of Berkeley, said the murder of his mother, Pearla Ann Louis, in May 2010 made him empathize with the Martin family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the same pain,&quot; Marshall said. &quot;They have lost someone to violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, whose father is white and mother is Hispanic, was not arrested after the shooting due to Florida's personal protection laws. Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law allows people to use deadly force in self-defense, which is why authorities have so far not charged Zimmerman. Similar laws are in effect in at least 23 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State and federal authorities are still investigating the case, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This young teenager was gunned down because of how he looked, because of the color of his skin,&quot; Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, said Monday. &quot;We need to see justice in this case immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congressional Black Caucus will lead briefings on Capitol Hill this week on hate crimes and racial profiling, Lee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While this issue has shocked American culture, it hasn't shocked me,&quot; Lee said. &quot;The combination of the powerful gun lobby, racial profiling and hate crimes make this local matter one of national attention. Sanford could be anywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oakland protest was just one of many that have taken place throughout the country since Martin's death. It is believed to have been the first in the East Bay, although several people also demonstrated Monday outside the San Francisco Hall of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesha Monge-Irizarry, whose son Idriss Stelley was fatally shot by San Francisco police in 2001, said, &quot;We're tired of saying 'no more stolen lives.' Now it's time for action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests also took place over the weekend in Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Columbia, S.C.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Bill Press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a time in the southern United States when racially charged murders of innocent civilians were routine. We remember the deaths of four little girls in the bombing of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church in September 1963; the June 1963 killing of Medgar Evers in Jackson, Miss.; and the murder of three young civil rights workers in June 1964 outside of Philadelphia, Miss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that was way back in the 20th century. Nobody could kill an innocent person today and get away with it. Right? Wrong! Add Trayvon&nbsp;Martin to the list. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This young black man was no civil rights activist. He was a 17-year-old high school junior, honor roll student, football player, hanging out with his father at his dad's girlfriend's house in Sanford, Fla. On the evening of Feb. 26, Trayvon went to a nearby 7-Eleven. After asking his little brother what he wanted, he hiked to the store and then began walking home, in the rain, wearing a hoodie, with nothing but a can of iced tea and a bag of Skittles for his brother. That's when the ugliness of the Deep South rose again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was spotted by 28-year-old George Zimmerman, a white Hispanic Neighborhood Watch volunteer, who called police and reported someone acting &quot;suspiciously.&quot; Authorities promised to respond, after cautioning him not to pursue the young man, which was advice Zimmerman immediately ignored. Zimmerman got out of his car, pursued Martin, confronted him, shot and killed him -- and then insisted he'd acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And here's the worst part: the Sanford Police Department swallowed his lame excuse -- hook, line, and sinker. They consider the case closed, they say, because they find no evidence to contradict Zimmerman's claim of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No evidence? How about this? Martin was walking and carrying only an iced tea and a bag of candy. Zimmerman was driving his car and armed with a 9-millimeter handgun. Martin weighed 140 pounds. Zimmerman weighs 250 pounds. Martin had no criminal record. Zimmerman was charged in July 2005 with resisting arrest with violence and battery on an officer. Plus, as reported in the Miami Herald, neighbors reported that Zimmerman was &quot;fixated on crime and focused on young, black males.&quot; He'd called police 46 times since January 2011 to report similar &quot;suspicious activity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's defense is further undermined by the testimony of Martin's girlfriend, whom he called to tell he was being pursued by a stranger. She heard him ask Zimmerman &quot;Why are you following me?&quot; and urged him to run. Moments later, on one of several 911 calls neighbors made to police, Martin's voice can be heard, crying for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Sanford police did not arrest Zimmerman. They filed no charges against him. They didn't even test him for drugs or alcohol. They performed a toxicology test on the dead teen instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All evidence suggests this was nothing but cold-blooded murder by an overzealous vigilante, who confronted and killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin only because he was black. But it's also clear that no justice will be done as long as local police are in charge. The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether Zimmerman should be charged with a civil rights crime. And the State Attorney's Office has convened a grand jury in the case. But that's not enough. Florida authorities should also take over the Sanford Police Department and demand the city manager fire its police chief (who stepped down temporarily Thursday).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman should be placed on trial. But so also should Florida's so-called &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; statute, signed into law by Jeb Bush in 2005, and under which Zimmerman claims immunity. Many warned at the time it would encourage just this kind of mindless, violent behavior. And that's exactly what's happened. As reported by the Orlando Sentinel, there were 13 citizen killings in the five years before 2005, but 36 in the five years following. In 2009, there were 45. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is the latest. It's time to tighten the law, or repeal it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's also time for President Obama to speak out about the injustice in this case. This could be a powerful teachable moment on how far we've come, yet how far we still have to go to achieve racial equality. And only he can deliver that message. As CNN's Roland Martin reminded my radio audience, &quot;If this had happened to a 17-year-old Barack Obama, he wouldn't be sitting in the White House today.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 26--Police said there are no indications so far that a Brentwood man broke the law early Sunday when he shot a 24-year-old intruder to a Foster City home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the District Attorney's office will make the decision on possible criminal charges for the shooter, who is in his 40s and was visiting the home on the 600 block of Crane Avenue, said Foster City police Capt. Jon Froomin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intruder, a San Mateo resident, was in surgery Sunday morning. Froomin said he didn't know the man's condition, but added he was conscious and breathing after the shooting. Police haven't released either man's identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Froomin said an occupant of the house heard a person walking around the home trying to open doors and called 911 at 4:22 a.m. Officers arrived about two minutes later, just as the shooter fired an unspecified number of shots. The confrontation happened as the shooter was about 15 feet from the intruder, who Froomin believes was unarmed. There was no indication of a struggle and police are still trying to confirm suspicions the intruder was a burglar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Froomin said state law allows people to use force to defend themselves inside their own homes. It's not a hard and fast rule though, and must applied the varying circumstances of each individual case. Investigators will compile the evidence and forward it to prosecutors for review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooter is not in police custody and was one of three guests and two residents sleeping at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">home as part of a family gathering. Froomin declined to specify the relationship between the shooter and homeowners. It was not clear if the shooter was the legal owner of the pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This shooting comes as a national debate rages over a Florida law that allows residents to use deadly force when they feel threatened. The so-called stand your ground is one of the central themes in the case of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teen shot to death by a neighborhood watch block captain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 26--OKLAHOMA CITY -- First, it was being the catalyst in the Heat team photograph showing support for Trayvon Martin's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Miami Heat forward LeBron James impressed with another feel-good moment. On Sunday, The Oklahoman reported James' nice gesture when the team stopped to refuel on the way to Portland three weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper, quoting an airport worker, said James urged the Heat players to take photos and sign autographs for military personnel. They, too, had stopped to refuel a dozen helicopters, according to the article. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James confirmed the story after the morning shootaround, saying he felt it was necessary to show support of the troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are guys who put their life in danger every day,&quot; James said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't be free. They give us freedom every day. It's ironic that they would be there at the airport the same time we were there. I got the team together. We all took a picture with all of them. I had a great conversation with them. They do so many great things for America, for all of us. The least we could do was take a picture with them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Friday's game against the Detroit Pistons, James was the ringleader in the team taking a photograph with all players wearing a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a move to show support for Martin, a black teen who was shot and killed in Sanford while wearing a hoodie. The story has drawn national attention because many believe Martin was racially profiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More flag football for Lebron-Durant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James and Oklahoma City forward Kevin Durant drew lots of attention for their flag football contest in December during the NBA lockout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are plans for a rematch, but it may have to wait until after next season. Both players considered doing it during the summer, but will be unavailable because of the Olympics in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rematch in flag football will happen,&quot; James said. &quot;I don't know if it's this summer because of the Olympics but it will happen at some point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James' team won 73-63 in a game that was streamed live on the Internet. The moment showed the strength of their friendship that began when Durant was in high school. They remained in contact over the years and worked out together last offseason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We called it 'Hell Week,' &quot; James said. &quot;Monday through Friday, we went twice a day. It was one of the toughest weeks we've both had as workouts. It was some great work that we've got out of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homecoming for Harris</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heat guard Terell Harris was in familiar surroundings for Sunday's game. It was a homecoming of sort for Harris, who played at Oklahoma State from 2005-09.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said he realized early Harris was a former member of the Cowboys program, known for its defensive tenacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It wasn't a coincidence,&quot; Spoelstra said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He plays like an Oklahoma State player. He was tough, physical. He had a defensive mentality from the first day of training camp. We basically brought him in for training camp just to put on Dwayne and LeBron for 10 days and he was dogging them for a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scoring down</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Sunday, the Heat had scored less than 100 points in nine of the last 11 games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spoelstra said it's a result of opponents making postseason pushes, causing an increased level of intensity. He said there was no concern with the low-scoring numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things have picked [up] since the All-Star break,&quot; Spoelstra said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're seeing a little more playoff intensity from a lot of the teams we're playing. Plus, we're playing of lot of these games on the road. None of these are excuses. When we're able to defend and finish off our defensive efforts with rebounding like we did [Friday], that usually translates into open-court opportunities. Our running numbers were better the other night.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After weeks of public outcry, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have launched an investigation into a case involving Florida's controversial self-defense law, which is similar to a bill that Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton wisely vetoed earlier this month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquiry is welcomed, since nearly two dozen states around the country have adopted kindred laws allowing citizens wide latitude in using deadly force, presumably for self-defense. Unfortunately, it took the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin to generate a national spotlight on the dangerous consequences of these laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Martin was walking to a friend's house from a Florida convenience store when he told a friend on the phone that he feared that he was being followed. He was right. George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer, suspected the teen was trouble and trailed him, even after a 911 emergency dispatcher told him to stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after, Zimmerman shot and killed Martin, claiming he had the right under Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; self-defense law because the teen attacked him. Martin, a popular teen with no criminal record, was unarmed. Although Zimmerman told police he shot Martin in self-defense, public protesters are raising critical questions as to whether racial profiling may have fueled the shooting. Martin was black; Zimmerman is a white Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past 14 months, Zimmerman made 46 calls to 911 dispatchers. After the shooting, police said they had no evidence to refute his story, despite witness accounts to the contrary, and refused to arrest him. Because of the outcry, a grand jury has been convened to look into the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws have been pushed by the Republican Party and the National Rifle Association, and opposed by law enforcement. In 2005, when Florida's law was adopted, then-Republican Gov. Jeb Bush sided with the gun lobby, calling the measure &quot;common sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it wasn't common sense. In most cases, the laws allow citizens to use lethal force in response to a threat, without fear of facing criminal prosecution or a civil lawsuit. Law enforcement officials say the laws have made it tougher to prosecute violent criminals, who now almost always claim they acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the laws give too much credence to the accounts of those claiming self-defense. As the Martin case so painfully illustrates, the standard too often seems to be &quot;shoot first, and ask questions later.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shot fired by a Florida neighborhood watch captain that killed an unarmed black teenager has echoed around the nation, prompting outrage and spotlighting gun laws. On Sunday in Minneapolis, it inspired calls for stricter gun controls and freshened the pain of Minnesotans who have lost sons and brothers to gunfire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survivors of about 10 gunshot victims were among about 70 people who gathered at north Minneapolis' Ascension Church for an anti-violence gathering, one of several held this weekend around the country. They included the brother of Jason Youngmark, who was fatally shot March 17 near 26th and Emerson Avenues N., just a few blocks from the church at 1704 Dupont Av. N.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also there, sitting quietly, was 12-year-old Ezra Mayes. His 3-year-old brother, Terrell Mayes Jr., was fatally injured Dec. 26 by a stray bullet that slammed into their home on Colfax Avenue N. after they heard gunshots outside at dinnertime and went for cover, Terrell carrying his plate of spaghetti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ezra said it was good so many people were getting together to talk about stopping the shooting. He looked sad and weary beyond his years as he said that he just wants people to put down the guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just like people are rallying for Trayvon [Martin, the teen shot in Florida], we need to rally people in Minneapolis,&quot; said K.G. Wilson, who wore camouflage clothing from head to toe as he spoke to the group. He stood near about 10 mothers and other loved ones of people slain in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't forget these families; these mothers are still grieving,&quot; said Wilson, who heads Hope Ministries and founded the Charez Jones Foundation, named after a 14-year-old Minneapolis girl killed by a stray bullet in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still grieving, too, on Sunday was Mary Johnson of north Minneapolis, whose son, Laramuin Byrd, was shot to death in 1993 after an argument at a party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">V.J. Smith, president of the Minneapolis Chapter of Mad Dads, encouraged those gathered to commit to trying to end gun violence by nurturing community leaders, including among the young. And somehow, the flow of guns into the hands of young people in inner-city neighborhoods must be stopped, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not far from Ascension Church stands one of the striking billboards that's gone up in recent days in an attempt by Minneapolis police, Clear Channel and Crime Stoppers to shake loose leads in the unsolved case. On the billboard is a photo of smiling Terrell and his mother, Marsha Mayes, who on Sunday spoke to the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What parents need to do is bring kids to these meetings,&quot; she said, mentioning she'd brought Ezra to the gathering. &quot;Us parents have to stand strong. If you don't, it's going to continue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The co-chair of a local neighborhood watch group said the Florida man accused of shooting an unarmed teen should have let police handle the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personally, I think the shooter responded the wrong way. I think he should have kept it in the hands of law enforcement,&quot; said Harold Cox Jr., co-chair of the Manor Avenue and Court Neighborhood Association. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26 has touched off a storm of protest from across the country. The teen was shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, who said he started following Martin because he looked suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman said he shot Martin in self-defense, although a police dispatcher had discouraged Zimmerman from following Martin in the first place. Zimmerman faces no criminal charges, but authorities on several levels are continuing to investigate the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shooting also has renewed debate about Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; self-defense law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cox said volunteers in his group are advised to not approach people who might be involved in illegal activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Be careful, don't put yourself at risk. If you see some type of activity you're not happy with, call 911. That's basically the easiest route,&quot; Cox said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jack Campbell, chief deputy of the Sangamon County Sheriff 's Office, had the same advice for anyone who believes someone is acting suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Definitely, do not take any proactive steps to follow that person. Don't confront them,&quot; Campbell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We want neighborhood watches to be our eyes and ears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When someone calls 911 about a suspicious person, dispatchers are going to ask for a description of the person, including their clothes and their approximate height and weight. If the person is in a vehicle, observers should note the make, model and license plates if possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The neighborhood watch group patrols regularly in Cox's neighborhood, which is near Lawrence Avenue and Livingston Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Crime has gone down a lot&quot; as a result of the patrols, he said. &quot;You have more of your neighbors involved now. Everybody is looking out for each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm here to explain why George Zimmerman is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This seems necessary given the confusion and anger with which some readers responded to my use of that word last week in this space to describe the man who shot an unarmed black teenager named Trayvon Martin to death last month in Sanford, Fla. One person wrote: &quot;Mr. Zimmerman was Hispanic not White plez do your homework before writing your column!!!!&quot; But it is they who are wrong. There are two reasons. The short one is this: &quot;Hispanic&quot; is not a race, but an ethnicity. As the U.S. Census Bureau puts it in its 2010 Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin, &quot;People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be any race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The long reason begins with an understanding that the word in question - race - is a term both meaningful and yet, profoundly meaningless. It is meaningful in the sense that it provides a tool for tribalism and a means by which to organize our biases, fears, observations, social challenges and sundry cultural products. It is meaningless in the sense that, well it has no meaning, that there exists no definition of &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot; that carries any degree of scientific precision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are taught to believe the opposite, that &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; are selfevident and immutable. But I invite you to look up Walter White, the blond, blue-eyed &quot;Negro&quot; who once led the NAACP, or Gregory Howard Williams, the university president who didn't even know he was black until he was 10 years old. And then think again. Race is a fraud, a cruel and stupid fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The people who came here from Europe did not automatically consider themselves &quot;white.&quot; They identified as Irish, Hungarian, Italian, Jewish, Armenian. As David Roediger observes in his book, &quot;Working Toward Whiteness: How America's Immigrants Became White,&quot; they were emphatically taught that &quot;white&quot; was the identity that conferred status and privilege and that it was defined by distance from, and antipathy toward, black. They were advised to avoid being friendly with blacks or else put their whiteness at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nor did Africans kidnapped into slavery think of themselves as &quot;black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were Mandinka, Fulani, Mende, Wolof. &quot;Black&quot; was something imposed upon them as justification for slavery and other means of exploitation. As one historian puts it: Africans did not become slaves because they were black; they became black because they were enslaved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well into the 20th century, America recognized dozens of &quot;races.&quot; In that America, people we now regard as white - the Irishman, Conan O'Brien; the Armenian, Andre Agassi; the Jew, Jerry Seinfeld - could not have taken for granted that they would be seen that way. People like this had to become white, had to earn whiteness, a feat African-Americans have found impossible to duplicate, no matter how many chemicals they use on their hair and skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White, then, is not simply color, but privilege - not necessarily in the sense of wealth, but rather in the sense of having one's personhood and individuality respected, a privilege so basic I doubt it registers with many whites as privilege at all. We're talking about the privilege of being seen, of having your worth presumed, of receiving the benefit of the doubt and some human compassion, of being treated as if you matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consider that; then consider the fair-skinned Hispanic man, George Zimmerman, who evidently stalked and killed an unarmed kid he wrongly thought was up to no good, yet was not arrested, nor even initially investigated. He said it was self-defense. Police took him at his word and sent him on his way.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are good reasons why the killing of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old black youth who was shot to death by a neighborhood watch volunteer while walking through a gated community in Florida, has attracted national outrage. Martin, who was unarmed, was slain by a Latino man named George Zimmerman, who had been pursuing Martin through the neighborhood, outweighed him by more than 100 pounds and was armed with a handgun. Yet Zimmerman claims that he acted in self-defense - and local police initially agreed, saying they didn't have enough evidence to charge Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, the matter won't end there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The public outcry in a case with heavy racial overtones has attracted the notice of the Justice Department, which is launching an investigation. It's easy to make a case for self-defense when you kill your only witness, and laws like Florida's encourage a dangerous shoot-first mentality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the left-wing blogosphere is abuzz about Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law and is now rallying to demand it be repealed. Unfortunately, this is a misuse of their efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stand your ground law simply establishes that when people are threatened they do not have a &quot;duty to retreat,&quot; and if they feel their life is in danger then they may respond with deadly force. There is nothing in stand your ground that would allow a person to pursue someone, confront him, start a fight with him and shoot him even though that person was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case is a misuse of the law. The Sanford Police Department says that according to testimony they had they were prohibited from arresting Zimmerman. If that's their excuse then they didn't investigate the case well enough and took Zimmerman at his word without corroboration. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Open minds, hearts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's murder has been justified by fear. We exist in a culture of fear. From the cradle to the grave, we are taught to be wary of what we don't know. Our brains naturally use cognitive shortcuts and stereotypes to process the unlimited flood of information that we are inundated with. In foreign policy, we compartmentalize alien cultures into enemies and terrorists - &quot;rogue states&quot; or &quot;the axis of evil.&quot; We assume the offensive to show that we are not afraid, but what this really highlights is how uncomfortable we are with the unknown. We simplify Earth into a place of false dichotomy - good vs. evil, black vs. white, us vs. them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we don't have to think this way. We can unlock our hearts and minds. We can approach others with an open palm rather than a clenched fist. We can change. Let's be creatures of dialogue and understanding, rather than fear mongering and force. Let's start with standing up for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I assumed that Sen. Rubio would want a possible problem with interpretation of Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law to be handled by the state government. But it seems that our inveterate states' rights advocate thinks that an agency of the national government is needed in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the wonderful thing about the states' rights movement. When things are going along smoothly, whether in New Orleans, along the gulf beaches or with the interpretation of Florida law, they tell us that they want the national government to stay out of their business. But when the going gets tough, whether from hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico or problems with the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law in Florida, they can't wait to call for assistance from the &quot;professionals&quot; of the federal government.</SPAN></P>

They get them on the black market, and will continue to do so even if you outlawed all guns for me!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not the law-abiding citizen with a carry permit, except in very few cases, and they get the attention of Al Sharpton and company so we hear about them. Where is Sharpton on the death of the police officer? When we discuss our prison systems? When we need help with poverty? I do agree that the &quot;stand your ground law&quot; needs tweaking, but we real gun guys would not use it in any way except to protect our family from harm; never to take a life, unless ours was truly in danger.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE RULING: HALF TRUE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., has reopened debate about the state's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the arguments we've heard from lawmakers wanting to change the 2005 law is that deaths due to self-defense are up dramatically since &quot;stand your ground&quot; passed. The law -- approved overwhelmingly by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005 -- allows people to use deadly force when they believe their life is at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Chris Smith, a Democrat who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, wants to rewrite the law because he fears its protections are too broad. Smith wants to change the law so that it only applies in cases that take place in a home, car or at work. He also wants to prohibit the use of &quot;stand your ground&quot; in cases where the shooter has provoked a confrontation, Smith said in a March 21 press release sent by the Senate Democratic office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This law has been a double-edged sword,&quot; said Smith, who was the House Democratic leader in 2005 when &quot;stand your ground&quot; passed. Smith voted against the law. &quot;Stand your ground' appears to be giving suspects better protections from arrest and prosecution than increased security measures for the citizens the law was originally intended to protect. This needs to be dramatically changed. - We can't keep turning a blind eye to the number of lives this law has claimed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the press release, Smith noted that &quot;since the law's passage, deaths due to self defense have jumped over 250 percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a significant increase worth checking out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we do in cases like this, we'll first check the numbers and then check to see if &quot;stand your ground&quot; is to blame as Smith suggests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statistic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;stand your ground&quot; statute states that &quot;a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith's office and the Senate Democratic office pointed to news stories -- a 2010 article in the Tampa Bay Times and a March 20, 2012, report on CBS 4 -- about the number of &quot;justifiable homicides,&quot; since the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law passed in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We contacted the Florida Department of Law Enforcement directly for data on justifiable homicides from 2000-10 and through the first half of 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FDLE uses this definition of justifiable homicides when collecting data for the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting: &quot;The killing of the perpetrator of a serious criminal offense either by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty or by a private citizen, during the commission of a serious criminal offense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FDLE's manual explains that the label is based on an investigating officer's findings -- not on the actions by a prosecutor or court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI's UCR handbook explains that a storekeeper shooting a gunman attempting a robbery is a justifiable homicide. But if two men playing cards get into an argument in which the first man attacked the second with a broken bottle and the second man shot his attacker claiming self-defense, that should not be reported as justifiable homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FDLE's data is based on information reported by police departments -- that reporting is voluntary but nearly all the agencies comply, FDLE spokesman Keith Kameg said. The data refers to how police labeled the homicide -- not charging decisions by prosecutors or court outcomes. FDLE compiles the data for the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, a national source of crime statistics.</SPAN></P>

</TABLE>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 2000-04 -- the five full years before &quot;stand your ground&quot; took effect -- law enforcement agencies in Florida reported an average of 12 justifiable homicides a year committed by civilians. From 2060-10 -- the first five full years after &quot;stand your ground&quot; became law -- law enforcement agencies reported an average of 36 justifiable homicides committed by civilians. Average to average, the number of justifiable homicides by civilians is now three times higher than it was in the years before 2005. That's an increase of 200 percent. (We excluded 2005 from this calculation because the law went into effect part way through the year.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is &Ocirc;stand your ground' to blame?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Smith is a little high in his estimate using FDLE data. Next, we wondered whether the 2005 law is the reason justifiable homicides among civilians are up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts we contacted didn't agree whether there is a simple cause and effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University, has researched how the FBI and police departments define justifiable homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminologists are suspicious of sharp increases or decreases within a short time frame, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe anything triples.-Increases that sharp are probably due to some artificial cause like a shift in how people are defining events,&quot; Kleck said. &quot;It's possible nothing actually changed in frequency except police departments increasingly defined homicide claimed to be defensive as a justifiable homicide. - Local police departments are increasingly viewing alleged defensible homicide as falling into the UCR definition. I don't think they are trying to rig data, they honestly shifted their perceptions of what qualifies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Eddins, state attorney in Florida's 1st Circuit and president of the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association, said he couldn't conclude if there is a correlation between the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law and the increase in justifiable homicides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although our overall crime rate has trended downward, &quot;the random violence seems to be increasing to me,&quot; Eddins said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To determine the effect of the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law would require examining how many times the statute was used, the result of the case and whether or not the &quot;stand your ground&quot; statute contributed to that resolution, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no real measurement set up to do that at this point. I cannot reach the conclusion that there is a direct correlation in the increases of justifiable homicide as a result of stand your ground law. I know other people are saying you can, but I can't reach it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Daniels, a public defender in the 2nd Circuit and president of the Florida Public Defender Association, said that she thinks there is a clear correlation between the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law and increase in justifiable homicide cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The types of incidents involved in &Ocirc;stand your ground' cases have always been with us, but some now are found to be justifiable,&quot; she said in an email. &quot;And who knows how many people have been emboldened to think violence is justified just because of the new law?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dennis Kenney, a criminal justice professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and a former police officer in Polk County, said that determining correlation between the numbers and the law would require examining the cases and seeing how often elements from the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law were raised. Without examining the numbers or the cases themselves, Kenney said it's &quot;highly likely&quot; that there is a correlation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Kenney, who was critical of the law, predicted: &quot;After all the publicity the current case is getting you would expect it to go up much more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David LaBahn, president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys based in Washington, said the increase in reported justifiable homicides could be the result of any number of factors -- including overall crime or population growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith said that since &quot;stand your ground&quot; passed in 2005, deaths due to self-defense have jumped over 250 percent. When we calculated the average for five years before the law passed and five years after it passed, we found an increase of 200 percent. That's short of Smith's claim, though the numbers largerly support the idea that self-defense deaths have increased since 2005. As for whether &quot;stand your ground&quot; is the reason self-defense deaths are up, experts either disagree or say it's difficult to determine without examining the specifics of each case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are times when you are jarred so deeply by an incident that your faith in all that is good and just about our society falters and teeters on the edge of being irrevocably shattered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old African American high school student from Miami is one of those times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, visiting his dad in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., was watching the NBA All-Star game when he left at the half-time break to buy Skittles and an Arizona Iced Tea at a nearby 7-11. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was on his way back from the store and talking to his girlfriend on his cellphone when he was chased and killed by 28-year-old George Zimmerman, a self-appointed neighborhood watch volunteer, who was taped on a 911 call referring to Trayvon as &quot;...These assholes, they always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young man's death is tragic enough, but what has stirred the outrage of the nation and the international community has been the coldhearted dismissal of his death by the Sanford Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police briefly questioned Mr. Zimmerman and sent him home with the weapon he used to kill Trayvon. And although they had access to his cellphone, the police then kept the young man in the morgue as a &quot;John Doe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't until Tracy Martin, the young man's father, called missing persons and the police to report his son missing that officers came to his home with a crime scene photograph, at which point they vouched for Mr. Zimmerman as being &quot;squeaky clean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Florida's &quot;Stand your Ground&quot; law, people are allowed to defend themselves with deadly force as long as they &quot;reasonably believe&quot; it is necessary to protect themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 911 recordings and statements by Trayvon's girlfriend and other witnesses seem to suggest that Mr. Zimmerman manufactured the threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence from the 911 tapes indicated that Trayvon, noticing that he was being followed by Mr. Zimmerman, began to run and that Mr. Zimmerman, ignoring the advice of the 911 operator not to give pursuit, chased down the young man and shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite having this information, the Sanford Police Department has refused to move against Mr. Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This reluctance, along with other incidents involving the Sanford Police Department, has heightened concern around racial profiling and the inequitable treatment of African Americans, particularly young black men, under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Sanford police chief was forced from office last year after he declined to press charges against the son of a lieutenant who was caught on camera beating up a homeless black man, and in 2005, the son of a Sanford Police Department veteran and a volunteer for the department, shot a black teenager in the back, killing him. The two, who were working as security guards, had their cases dismissed on a self-defense plea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keesha LaTulippe, director of the Office for Racial and Economic Equity at the Henry Lee Willis Community Center, is among the millions who have reacted with shock and dismay to the lack of an arrest in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Worcester resident and a member of an inter-racial family, Ms. LaTulippe said Trayvon's death compelled her to sit down and talk with her 11-year-old daughter about the injustices she might encounter in her young life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want her to know that these are not isolated, random incidents that could happen anywhere, rather that these are recurring patterns of behavior that are the result of a community and culture that allows everyday acts of systematic racism to occur,&quot; she wrote in a Facebook posting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it is happening in my community, which it is, what am I doing to stop it? That is what I ask myself...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is what we all should be asking ourselves.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Churchgoers across America attended services wearing hoodies yesterday in a show of solidarity for a black teenager whose fatal shooting in Florida by a white Hispanic man has prompted a civil rights uproar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preachers also wore hoodies in pulpits, symbolising support for the growing calls for justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old killed on an errand to buy sweets for his younger brother by a Neighbourhood Watch captain who deemed him &quot;suspicious&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are doing this not for show, but to send a message that all humanity is sacred,&quot; said the Rev Raphael Warnock, of Ebenezer Baptist Church, in Atlanta, Georgia, who was among the tens of thousands who joined protests yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civic officials in Sanford, where Trayvon was shot dead on February 26 while visiting his father, appealed for &quot;calm heads and no vigilante justice&quot; after the announcement by the New Black Panther Party, a militant black vigilante group, of a $10,000 (&pound;6,300) bounty for the capture of George Zimmerman, 28. Police have refused to arrest him for the shooting after he claimed that he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party issued a call on Saturday for 10,000 men to help it to hunt down and capture Mr Zimmerman, who has gone into hiding in fear of his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Miami, where Trayvon lived with his mother, students at 19 schools walked out of class on Friday to protest that no action had been taken against Mr Zimmerman, and more demonstrations are expected today. Rallies demanding justice for Trayvon were held in several cities at the weekend and in Sanford a Prayer for Peace event was organised by city officials for last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Miami Heat basketball team showed support by publishing a photograph of themselves with their heads bowed, all wearing hoodies. An online petition calling on Florida's Attorney-General to prosecute Mr Zimmerman has received nearly two million signatures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON: President Obama did not mention race even as he addressed it on Friday, instead letting his person and his words say it all, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weighing in for the first time on the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot and killed a month ago in Florida by a neighbourhood watch volunteer , Obama in powerfully personal terms deplored the &quot;tragedy&quot; and, as a parent, expressed sympathy for the boy's mother and father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can only imagine what these parents are going through. And when I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Every parent in America,&quot; he added, &quot;should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this and that everybody pulls together -- federal, state and local -- to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While speaking movingly as the father of two girls, Obama notably made no reference to the racial context that has made the killing of Trayvon and the gunman's claim of self-defence a rallying point for African-Americans . Since Obama first began campaigning to be &quot;president of all the people,&quot; when pressed on racial issues, he has been generally reluctant to talk about race. And after his historic election as the first black president, Obama learned the hard way about the pitfalls of the chief executive opining on law enforcement involving civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Obama's aide, requesting anonymity, said that there was no internal debate about how to respond to Trayvon's death, but that Obama wanted to await justice department's initial review and the announcement by his attorney general, Eric H Holder Jr, that the civil rights division would investigate .</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pastor T.D. Hicks stood in front of his congregation Sunday morning wearing white sneakers, jeans and a black hooded sweatshirt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From his pulpit at Antioch Baptist Church, Hicks smiled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today it does my heart good to see you in your hoodies,&quot; Hicks announced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's service wasn't a casual church service but part of a solidarity movement suggested by their minister to support Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family, more than half of the people at the church's two services had people wearing hoodies.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old Florida high school student, was killed in Sanford, Fla., a community north of Orlando, on Feb. 26 while wearing a hooded sweatshirt. Former Topeka city manager Norton Bonaparte is the city manager in Sanford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locally, hoodies came into the spotlight when Topeka Police Chief Ron Miller in February suggested crime could be deterred by making people remove their hoods before entering a business. Topeka Mayor Bill Bunten said he wanted discussion on the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around the country there have been groups protesting the death of Martin by wearing hooded sweatshirts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hicks said he hoped that wearing the sweatshirts would bring more awareness to the incident that happened in Sanford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a black or a white issue - this is an issue of injustice,&quot; Hicks said. &quot;It is up to us as the body of Christ as believers and humans to say that one needs to take stand up for a wrong.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washburn student Phillip Watson, 21, felt that church was the right place to wear his blue hooded sweatshirt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Church is a place of healing and a place of outreach,&quot; Watson said. &quot;With something like this going on in this country, we should be active no matter where it is happening. I know some people here that went out and bought hoodies because they wanted to wear one today because it is that important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watson acknowledged that the clothes don't make the person, remembering when he was in high school and they banned do rags at Topeka West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you take something like that, you blow it up and make it taboo and perpetuate those stereotypes,&quot; Watson said. &quot;We don't need to perpetuate those stereotypes. It has nothing to do with who we are on the inside, and we don't need to judge people on what they are wearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesia Carter, 53, agreed while wearing her gray hooded sweatshirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that we are using the symbol of the hoodie doesn't have anything to do with clothes at all,&quot; Carter said. &quot;It brings attention to injustices. We need to see there are still things going on that we need to pay attention to and possibly change.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today wasn't the first time that Carter has worn a sweatshirt to church. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a come-as-you-are policy,&quot; Carter said. &quot;God doesn't look at what you are wearing, he looks at your heart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that we came together in unity to say something even though we are not anywhere close to where this tragedy happened,&quot; Carter said. &quot;What matters is that the world is coming together to say something needs to be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carter hopes that more light will shine on the issue locally and nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are talking about banning things, then we need to stop and see why people are wearing this and why they are taking a stance,&quot; Carter said. &quot;You have to listen, and then listening requires change. If you are going to listen, then that means that you are willing to do something about what I suggested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hicks told his congregation that all around the country pastors were asking their members to come together and pray for the family of Martin but he had a few amendments on that prayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They should also pray for Sanford city manager Norton Bonaparte, and the family of George Zimmerman, because all of their lives changed in an instant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One thing I know is that my neighbor is hurting and because my neighbor is hurting I should be hurting too,&quot; Hicks said. &quot;That's why we are here and praying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hicks said in between church services that he thought that wearing hoodies at church was a good idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the best things I saw today was one of our senior members had her hoodie on today in support and solidarity of what the church was doing,&quot; Hicks said. &quot;Often times support isn't voiced - sometimes you can just see it visibly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Churchgoers wear hoodies to honor slain teenager EATONVILLE, Fla. - Wearing hooded sweatshirts similar to the one that Trayvon Martin wore on the night he was killed, many preachers and worshippers echoed calls for justice Sunday in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager in Florida last month. The one-month anniversary of Martin's death is Monday. He was shot while wearing a &quot;hoodie&quot; as he walked home on a rainy night in a gated community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighborhood watch volunteer who shot him, 28-year-old George Zimmerman, is the son of a white father and Hispanic mother, and the demands to charge him in Martin's slaying have grown ever louder. He had called police to report the hooded figure as suspicious; the 17-year-old Martin was carrying a bag of Skittles and a can of iced tea, talking to his girlfriend on his cellphone. In African-American and other religious centers from Florida to Atlanta, New York and Chicago, messages from pulpits couldn't help but touch on a seemingly avoidable tragedy that continues to be rife with more questions than answers. But while the call continued for the arrest of Zimmerman, there were also pleas to use the incident to spark a larger movement. &quot;How do we turn pain into power?&quot; the Rev. Jesse Jackson asked a standing-room only congregation of hundreds while preaching at Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church in Eatonville, Fla., about 20 miles from the site of the Sanford shooting. &quot;How do we go from a moment to a movement that curries favor?&quot; Jackson preached a sermon entitled &quot;The Substance of Things Hoped For.&quot; He called for Martin's &quot;martyr&quot; death to be used as an opportunity to revive the Civil Rights Commission and draw attention to long-standing issues. Very young children and teens sat in the choir behind him. House GOP budget plan heats up as campaign issue WASHINGTON - The new debt-slashing budget plan pushed by House Republicans heated up as a presidential campaign issue Sunday as the proposal's architect, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, sparred with top Democrats over its political fallout and downplayed the possibility he could be tapped as a vice presidential candidate. Senior White House adviser David Plouffe dismissed the GOP plan Sunday as &quot;a lot of candy, not a lot of vegetables,&quot; and charged that it would be &quot;rubber-stamped&quot; as law if leading Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney is elected. &quot;This is really the Romney-Ryan plan,&quot; Plouffe said, adding that its mix of across-the-board tax cuts and stiff budget cuts &quot;showers huge tax cuts on millionaires and billionaires paid for by senior and veterans.&quot; Ryan tried to tamp down speculation that he could be tapped for the No. 2 spot on the GOP ticket, although who will be the nominee is far from settled. &quot;I would have to consider it, but it's not something I'm even thinking about right now because right - I think our job in Congress is pretty important,&quot; Ryan said. &quot;And what we believe we owe the country is, if we don't like the direction the president is taking us, which we don't, we owe them a specific sharp contrast and a different path that they can select in November. And doing this in Congress is really important.&quot; Student shot to death on Mississippi State campus STARKVILLE, Miss. - A 21-year-old student was shot to death in a Mississippi State University dormitory, though the killing appears to be isolated and there is no indication others may be in danger, officials said Sunday. University president Mark Keenum said Sunday in a statement on the school's website that the killing of 21-year-old John Sanderson of Madison, Miss., was the first time a student had been shot on the campus. Keenum said officials could reveal few other details because of the ongoing investigation. University spokeswoman Maridith Geuder said police received a call about the shooting at Evans Hall around 10 p.m. Saturday. Sanderson was taken to Oktibbeha County Hospital, where he died. Three male suspects fled the building in a blue Crown Victoria. No arrests have been made. Shortly after the shooting, the university began sending a series of text message alerts to students. Police officers stepped up patrols to make sure the campus was safe, Keenum said. The four-story Evans Hall holds about 300 male students and is located on the north side of campus. The campus of about 20,000 students is located in a rural area in the northeastern part of the state, about 125 miles northeast of Jackson. Iraqi woman severely beaten in Calif. home dies EL CAJON, Calif. - A woman from Iraq who was found beaten next to a threatening note saying &quot;go back to your country&quot; has died, and police are investigating the possibility of a hate crime. Hanif Mohebi, the director of the San Diego chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said Shaima Alawadi was taken off life support Saturday. &quot;The family is in shock at the moment. They're still trying to deal with what happened,&quot; said Mohebi, who met with family members. Alawadi, a 32-year-old mother of five, had been hospitalized since her 17-year-old daughter found her unconscious in the dining room of the family's El Cajon home in suburban San Diego on Wednesday, police Lt. Steve Shakowski said. &quot;A hate crime is one of the possibilities, and we will be looking at that,&quot; Lt. Mark Coit said. &quot;We don't want to focus on only one issue and miss something else.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calls for legal action in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin are growing as preachers took to their pulpits wearing &quot;hoodies&quot; in symbolic solidarity  around the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One month after the death of the unarmed 17-year-old African American by a neighborhood watch  volunteer in Sanford, Fla.,  civil rights activist Jesse Jackson said the youth was a &quot;martyr&quot; whose death could be an opportunity to revive concerns about civil rights and violence. He called for a change in Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; self-defense law, similar to one in more than 20 other states, that may have prevented charges from being filed in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do we turn pain into power?&quot; Jackson asked a standing-room only congregation  while preaching at Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church in Eatonville, Fla., about 20 miles from the site of the Sanford shooting. &quot;How do we go from a moment to a movement that curries favor?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The blood of the innocent has power,&quot; Jackson said, naming other slain black Americans whose deaths became rallying cries in the struggle for equality. &quot;There's power in the blood of Emmett Till. There's power in the blood of Medgar Evers. There's power in the blood of Dr. King.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern over the killing was echoed in religious centers from Atlanta to New York and California, with many preachers and their congregations wearing hooded sweatshirts in Martin's memory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was wearing a hooded sweatshirt as he walked home on a rainy night in a gated community. The neighborhood watch volunteer who shot him, George Zimmerman, 28, has not been charged, and demands for an arrest have been growing. The chief of the city's police force stepped aside last week amid criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Northern California, &quot;Hoodie Sunday&quot; was marked in hundreds of congregations including those in Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose and Sacramento, organizers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As faith leaders, we are outraged that the killer showed so little regard for Trayvon that he took his life needlessly and senselessly,&quot; the group, PICO, a network of faith-based community organizations, said in a statement. &quot;We are outraged that local law enforcement officials have failed to act justly and expeditiously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman had called police to report that a hooded figure in the neighborhood looked suspicious. Trayvon turned out to be carrying  a bag of candy and a can of iced tea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a black man in America, Shaka Berry, 38,  says he has been stopped by police for no apparent reason. He says he is desensitized to news about the deaths of black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when Berry, a telecommunications salesman who lives in Washington, D.C., learned details of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, he said he was moved to tears. He was disturbed about news reports that Trayvon, 17, of Sanford, Fla., was fatally shot Feb. 26 while returning from a run to 7-Eleven for iced tea and Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berry was disheartened that shooter George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer described as white by police, had not been arrested. So Berry expressed himself like many others on Facebook: He posted a photo of himself in a hooded sweatshirt -- what Trayvon was wearing when he died. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photo &quot;was my little way to express outrage at what happened to the kid,&quot; Berry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berry's visual statement is  part of a social media trend: Black Americans and, to a smaller extent, Hispanic Americans are using such media in larger numbers than Americans overall, experts say. Word of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case has gone viral  as social media users, including many black Americans, publicize rallies and  urge contacts to sign petitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely to use their cellphones as their sole way of connecting to the Internet, said Aaron Smith, senior research specialist with the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project. This tends to translate into wider social media use, Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among cellphone users, 39% of black, non-Hispanic Americans and 35% of Hispanic Americans access social networking sites compared with 24% of white, non-Hispanic Americans, according to a 2011 Pew survey of 2,277 adults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Younger black Americans grew up communicating by text and instant message, and social media interaction feels natural, said Michael Street, a New York-based social media strategist. This generation tends to communicate  by sharing photos and information as close to real time as possible, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sites like BlackPlanet.com and MySpace helped to train and introduce this audience to social media,&quot; Street said. &quot;Now that they have the knowledge, they have taken it and run with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social media have evolved as an outlet for people who feel ignored, said Rashad Robinson, executive director of ColorOfChange.org, a  New York-based organization that plans events focused on issues involving black Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're hearing stories of mothers telling   of   their fear for their children in the criminal justice system,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;We're hearing from fathers telling us about 'the talk' that they have with their young sons or nephews&quot; about carrying themselves passively so they can avoid trouble with police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trend is probably an extension of what black Americans have been doing for centuries -- communicating through word-of-mouth, said William Winters, senior campaigner for Change.org, where a petition related to the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case has generated the most signatures of any petition on its site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think part of it has to do with the oral storytelling traditions in black communities,&quot; Winters said. &quot;What is new about it is the speed at which the sharing of information can happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many seem to innately recognize the power of social media in reaching  black Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syndicated radio talk show host Michael Baisden, who is black,  urged his Facebook followers to post photos of themselves in hoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baisden, host of The Michael Baisden Show, told USA TODAY that he likes interacting via social media because &quot;it's just me and them and so they're getting their information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and others credit social media with publicizing other cases with racial implications, including that of Troy Davis, the Georgia man executed Sept. 21 for a murder that supporters  believe he didn't commit, and the Jena Six, six black teens in Jena, La., convicted in December 2006 of beating a white student, though critics felt the punishment was harsh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marian Wright Edelman, founder  of the Washington-based Children's Defense Fund, sent a staffer out to buy a hoodie so she could post a photo of herself wearing one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mrs. Edelman really felt that she wanted to stand with all the young people who were standing up for justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; said spokeswoman Patti Hassler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, host of The War Room with Jennifer Granholm on Current TV, also posed for a hoodie photo. In an e-mail to USA TODAY, Granholm wrote, &quot;The hoodie is a way of expressing support for the Martin family, and for all the sons of African-American families who bear the heavy burden of other people's negative assumptions.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine that was your kid, walking home from the store, minding his own business when  some puffed-up, not-in-uniform, trigger-happy guy started following him in his car and then on foot, scared him, challenged him and shot him dead. Forever.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not about a black kid being shot because he resisted or was in an area where he &quot;didn't belong.&quot; This is about a citizen assuming he had the authority to enforce a law and to carry a weapon where neither  authority nor training  was present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is truly  tragic  when a teenager  cannot walk to a 7-Eleven,  buy a snack and walk home without being shot. It is not possible to know all the facts from news media reports, but, so far,  this story stinks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keep weapons out of wrong hands</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's talk about the 800-pound gorilla in the egregious case of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and George Zimmerman. The Second Amendment allows the freedom to keep and bear arms. With rights, however, come responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've served close to 30  years in the fire and emergency service business. During that time, I've seen more than my share of shootings and cannot, for the life of me, remember anyone shooting  someone to protect life and/or property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do remember a friend's wife, an accomplished tournament handgun expert, accidentally  shooting herself  in the leg while investigating a bump in the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fire department was  awakened one night to find three young people with holes in their heads as a result of some sort of dispute. I  remember eight shifts in a row that started or ended with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the emotional effect of this tragedy weighs heavily on us all, I hope it will stimulate reasoned discussions on how we can keep idiots from getting weapons for which the sole purpose is to  shoot people for no apparent reason.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Focus on sacredness of life</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your editorial  &quot;In Trayvon's death, ugly echoes&quot;  ends with questions to ponder (Friday). Some questions I have:  If Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had been white and shot to death, would this have been a national  or a local story? If George Zimmerman had been black and shot a white boy, would Al Sharpton  have held a rally for the boy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt  race played a factor in this incident, but I think the tragedy is we have made race the primary focus of this story. What I see is a young boy whose life has been taken away. An individual has been killed, never to achieve his God-given potential. My prayers go to his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe the primary focus of this tragic story should be Trayvon, a young person. That is what will give meaning to his life.  Let's make this about the sacredness of a human life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we shift our primary focus in such a way, we hopefully will begin to see each other as human beings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group linked to the militant Black Panthers organization has offered a bounty for the capture of George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch captain who killed an unarmed black teen-ager in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Churches across the U.S. held services for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old whose death last month while on his way home from a convenience story led to outrage around the country after Zimmerman, 28, was able to plead self-defence to escape prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a protest in Sanford, Fla., where the killing took place, Mikhail Muhammad, the leader of the New Black Panthers, announced a reward for his apprehension. Asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad said: &quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bounty announcement came moments after members of his group called for the mobilization of 5,000 black men to capture Zimmerman. Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland and Jacksonville - where the 28-year-old worked before the shooting. But he declined to say when they will begin their hunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammed led the group in chanting &quot;Justice for Trayvon!&quot; and &quot;Black Power!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the government won't do the job, we'll do it,&quot; Muhammad said, leading his group of eight party members in chants like &quot;freedom or death&quot; and &quot;justice for Trayvon&quot; while making the iconic gesture of raising their fists into the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pastor Moses Brown of Tampa said he was disappointed with the Panthers' approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe in a message of justice, not hate,&quot; said Brown, who was in town to pray at the memorial. &quot;We believe justice will come through the court system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanford rally was one of dozens held to protest at Tray-von's death, as demands for Zimmerman's arrest grew. He is in hiding and is said to be in fear for his life while a series of investigations are held into the decision of Sanford police not to press charges against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Black Panthers, inspired by the Black Panthers revolutionaries of the 1960s, has been named as a hate group by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Southern Poverty Law Center says the New Black Panther Party, a black-separatist group founded in 1989, is &quot;virulently racist and anti-Semitic,&quot; and its leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews and law officers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see what he was wearing?&quot; asked the voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A dark hoodie, like a gray hoodie,&quot; George Zimmerman told the 911 operator moments before he shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, whom he described as &quot;real suspicious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of tragedy, the utilitarian hooded sweatshirt, which first gained popularity in the 1930s as a practical pullover for workingmen, has emerged as a Rorschach test of racial perceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, many preachers and their congregations attended services wearing hoodies in a show of solidarity with the slain teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, LeBron James of the Miami Heat tweeted a photoof the basketball team, wearing hoodies and with heads bowed, alongside the hashtag &quot;WeWantJustice.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same day, Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera ignited widespread criticismfor saying on the &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; morning show that &quot;The hoodie is as much responsible for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death as George Zimmerman was.&quot; He continued his assault on &quot;The O'Reilly Factor,&quot; warning parents of black and Hispanic youths not to allow their sons to wear hooded sweatshirts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who else wears hoodies?&quot; he asked. &quot;Everybody that ever stuck up a convenience store; D.B. Cooper, the guy that hijacked a plane; Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Daniel Maree, 24, who spearheaded Wednesday's&quot;Million Hoodie March&quot; in New York - which was followed by ralliesin Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit and Washington - said he wanted to draw attention not just to Martin's death, but to the hoodie and all it represents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've had experiences where I've been walking down the street in New York, and as an African American man in a hoodie, I can tell you it's seen as incredibly suspicious,&quot; said Maree, a digital strategist in New York. &quot;Some people hold their purses a little tighter. When I heard Trayvon was wearing a hoodie, I thought, 'I've felt this before.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how did this ubiquitous garment - worn by college students and soccer moms, skateboarders and kids on the street - come to be associated with sinister activity?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most pieces of material culture have symbolic qualities associated with them,&quot; said Darnell Hunt, professor of sociology and director of the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies at UCLA. &quot;The hoodie is a pretty generic piece of clothing, but because of the contexts and the groups it's associated with, it took on different meanings. Just like sagging pants, it was a macho, street-swagger symbol of hip-hop culture, even though it originated in medieval Europe.&quot;<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">A history of the hoodie</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoods were worn by monks and scholars in the Middle Ages. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has a child's hooded tunicthat dates back to the seventh century. Dante Alighieri, the 14th-century Florentine poet who wrote &quot;The Divine Comedy,&quot; is rarely depicted without his hood. In some climates, the hood was used to contain body heat, while in North Africa's Maghreb region, the unisex djellaba, a long robe with a pointed hood, is still worn to protect the wearer from the sand and sun. And it could always be used to conceal the identity of the wearer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hooded sweatshirt was commercialized in the 1930s by Champion, the American sportswear company, to protect workingmen from the elements. And Daniel James Cole, professor of fashion history at the Fashion Institute of Technology, says that later in that decade, American high fashion adopted the hood: &quot;The American designer Claire McCardell popularized it for women in the early 1940s. One really popular coat style was an A-line swing coat with the hood on it, and there were hooded playsuits and even hooded wedding dresses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't until the mid-1970s, when Rocky Balboa wore one while running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art in &quot;Rocky,&quot; that the hooded sweatshirt with its convenient front pocket became a hallmark of unisex sportswear. In the 1990s, hip-hop artists and street culture adopted it as the street-wear uniform of choice - and the term &quot;hoodie&quot; became commonplace, according to Merriam Webster, in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hip-hop culture took it from general vernacular clothing and certainly increased . . . its popularity,&quot; Cole said. &quot;It became cool, and fashion adopted it soon after. You have sleeveless hoodies, which takes away the idea of wearing a hood for warmth. It's become vernacular.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since designers such as Tommy Hilfiger popularized them in the mid-1990s, hoodies have sold at all price points, at both Neiman Marcus and Wal-Mart. A hooded jacket by Altuzarra will cost you $2,495. Hoodies know no class or cultural borders. Some schools, including several in the District, have banned the garment for its sloppiness or because it's a convenient way to hide contraband items or test answers. They're worn by gangsters, rappers, surfers, skaters and athletes; indie rock fans wear hoodies almost as often as they wear Chuck Taylors; and hoodies have been preppified by brands such as Hollister, a popular teen label Martin worein a photo released by his parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In parts of New Zealand and Australia, there are &quot;Hoodie Free Zones&quot; enforced by store owners and malls to thwart shoplifters. They became a political symbol in the summer during the riots in Britain, and in 2006, Prime Minister David Cameron gave a speech claiming, &quot;For young people, hoodies are often more defensive than offensive.&quot; The speech has since been dubbed Cameron's &quot;hug-a-hoodie&quot; speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cozy and casual, hoodies are called &quot;bunny hugs&quot; in parts of Canada.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Its changing meaning</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still the garment's meaning remains mixed. Even the word &quot;hoodie&quot; has echoes of racial overtones, differentiated only by prepositions and suffixes. In the hood. From the hood. Hoodlum, derived from &quot;hudelum,&quot; found in a 19th-century German dialect, meaning ruffian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By concealing the wearer's identity, a hood can seem sinister: Hooded white men killed black men long before Martin died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that's one of the reasons it acquired a sinister connotation,&quot; Hunt said. &quot;It has inherent qualities of mystery and anxiety. You put a hood on, and you're anonymous. The KKK, for example, wore hoods for all those reasons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the shift from Rocky's triumph to what some see as a threat was recent. Hunt believes that films such as &quot;Menace II Society&quot; and &quot;South Central,&quot; which followed the 1992 Los Angeles riots, propagated the image of the hoodie as a symbol of urban rebellion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things preexist the meanings they acquire,&quot; Hunt said. &quot;Black people have endured the perception that people have about criminality. There's certain beliefs that some people have about young black men that often lead them to fear them, unjustified. It stands to reason that the hoodie as a style and symbol changed when young black men chose to wear it . . . White youths and older folks in hoodies have relatively benign meanings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denis Wilson noticed the hoodie's symbolic evolution in 2006. The Philadelphia-based journalist wrote a piece on the hoodie for the New York Timesafter a friend asked him, &quot;Are you trying to be a gangster?&quot; when he went to a nightclub wearing one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because I'm white, I thought the hoodie was skater,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;But I went back through the history, and I saw the shift when graffiti artists used it to shroud themselves when tagging trains. There's a connection to the more violent overtones of hip-hop. To ignore the violence in NWA and 50 Cent is silly, but it's absolutely stupid to think of the hoodie as dangerous. There are hoodies made for nursing mothers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of Martin's death, Maree hopes the hoodie - whoever is wearing it - will become a symbol of progress, reminding us of the power of perception and the symbolism we assign to everyday objects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll never think of a hoodie the same way I used to,&quot; Maree said. &quot;While I didn't think about this on the outset, it's become a way to confront our initial or subliminal reactions to race. It's subconscious, but when people start to confront their initial reactions, we'll see progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powerful reactions, and potent imagery, continue to emerge from the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama said Friday, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot; Members of the Miami Heat took a team picture wearing hoodies in memory of Martin. And in many cities, thousands have made striking visual statements by donning Martin's jacket of choice in such public protests as the Million Hoodie March in New York and the &quot;Hoodies on the Hill&quot; rally and prayer service outside the Capitol in the District. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's a cartoon depictions of the Florida teen's death that is stirring controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some readers of Rob Rogers, the editorial cartoonist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, are upset that in commenting on the fatal shooting, the artist has invoked the visceral imagery of a lynching, drawing the teenager's shooter, George Zimmerman, in the  hooded clothes of a Klansman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rogers stands staunchly behind his illustrated editorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The killing of African American teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman in Florida last month was not an act of self-defense,&quot; Rogers argued, noting that Martin was unarmed, toting only iced tea and Skittles. Rogers sees the killing as an act of &quot;racist violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that in mind, he wasn't about to pull any editorial punches as he rendered his judgment in ink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I realize that the image of a lynching can be disturbing and horrific, even in a cartoon,&quot; Rogers says. &quot;I can certainly understand why some readers may find such an image shocking and unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the other hand,&quot; he says, &quot;it is the job of an editorial cartoonist to push the boundaries and to use the power of an image to get a point across. I felt it was my job to show the horror of this injustice . . . with the hope that by bringing attention to it, maybe it won't happen as often.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tragic killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martinin Florida casts a spotlight on the Neighborhood Watch program, which is used by thousands of communities across the nation to reduce crime. Although news accounts vary, at the very worst the killer was a police wannabe who patrolled his neighborhood with an itchy trigger finger. At the very best, he apparently was patrolling under the auspices of a Neighborhood Watch effort that was outside the purview of the local police, who could have provided critical training and advice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in my small Northern Virginia community, we have been instructed by Fairfax County's crime prevention officers to patrol by car only; to carry no weapons; to report suspicious activity by calling 911;  to never - ever - confront suspicious people; and to travel only in pairs. The latter policy allows a more cool-headed patrol partner to discourage an overeager companion from acting hastily. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, if George Zimmerman had had a partner, perhaps Mr. Martin's death could have been prevented. This activity is called Neighborhood &quot;Watch&quot; because patrols are supposed to watch and report, not engage. One hopes that this tragedy will encourage communities that have  unsanctioned patrols to coordinate with their local police to ensure that their volunteers help prevent crime, not cause it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirk F. Randall, Fairfax</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin may or may not have been partly about race, although the protests seem intent on making it so. Even President Obama seems to think this is exclusively about children who might look like him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This focus on race, however, obscures a larger, universal issue. This killing was about guns and their insane proliferation in our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many things are in dispute here, but the core facts are not. Two people had an altercation of some kind, one of whom had a gun. The result, while tragic, is not surprising. The question we should be asking ourselves is: Why do we allow private citizens to prowl the streets with guns acting as self-appointed vigilantes?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 26--NEW ORLEANS -- The president of the NAACP in New Orleans, Danatus King, is concerned about what could follow the online comments of an NOPD officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That has a potential to set off something in this city that could be disastrous to all of us,&quot; King said while at his office Monday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About an hour before King expressed his concerns, NOPD Superintendent Ronal Serpas told reporters that he was suspending indefinitely Officer Jason Giroir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do know that these are his statements, and that's unrefuted,&quot; Serpas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments from both men stem from the killing of a Florida teenager, Trayvon Martin. The killing has sparked outrage around the country, although so far the neighborhood watch captain who shot him remains uncharged. Around the country, including the New Orleans area, people are gathering to remember Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WWL-TV in New Orleans aired a story on one such gathering over the weekend and posted the story on the web. A couple of comments allegedly came from Giroir and said that Martin lived like a thug and died like a thug. When another blogger posted a comment critical of Giroir's, he appears to respond, &quot;...come on down to our town with a hoodie and you can join Martin in hell...&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giroir made headlines earlier this month when he was involved in a shootout that left one suspect dead and two officers in the hospital. Now, the NAACP doubts the credibility of the officer. King is worried the latest blogging comments could spark unrest during what should be a proud time for the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have the Final Four that's coming to town. And no telling what's going to happen with this tinder box that's been set off,&quot; Kind said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm asking the community not to let the comments of one officer stand in the way of the great work that we have done together,&quot; Serpas said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 26--WILLIAMSON -- Local voices are joining the national outrage over the shooting of a black teenager in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, was killed Feb. 26, in Sanford, Fla. He was returning to a gated community in the city after buying candy at a convenience store. He was unarmed and was wearing a hooded sweat shirt, called a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, has not been charged in the shooting. Zimmerman has said the teen attacked him and he shot him in self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told police he was attacked by 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin after he had given up chasing the boy and he was returning to his truck. He had a bloody nose and blood on the back of his head, according to police. Martin's family questions Zimmerman's story, and believes if their races were reversed, there is no doubt a black shooter would be jailed, even if he claimed self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel that this was outright murder and the police were in on the cover up, and they got caught,&quot; Johnny Fullen, President of the West Virginia NAACP said. &quot;This guy should go to jail right now. And all of the hate speech that is going on, and has been going on, is making it worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida shooting has ignited a furor against the police department of the Orlando suburb of 53,500 people, prompting rallies and a protest in Gov. Rick Scott's office on Tuesday. Sanford city commissioners on Wednesday voted 3-2 to express &quot;no confidence&quot; in Police Chief Bill Lee Jr. over the handling of the fatal shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A demonstration was held last week in New York in the teenager's memory, a sign of growing outrage over the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators chanting &quot;we want arrests&quot; converged on Manhattan's Union Square for the Million Hoodie March. The demonstrators greeted the teen's parents with &quot;God bless you!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's mother, told the crowd: &quot;My heart is in pain, but to see the support of all of you really makes a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department and FBI have opened a civil rights investigation, and the local prosecutor has convened a grand jury April 10 to determine whether to charge Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urging Americans to &quot;do some soul searching,&quot; President Barack Obama injected himself into the emotional debate over the fatal shooting of a teenager in Florida, turning the racially charged case into a personal matter for the nation's first black president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the leading Republican candidates for president said an investigation into his death was an appropriate course to take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Fullen said he felt politics should not play a part in the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The things that has been said with the presidential election coming up just make it worse,&quot; Fullen told the Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bitterly criticized Police Chief Bill Lee stepped down temporarily, he said to help quell the rising passions surrounding the case. Hours later, Gov. Rick Scott announced that the county prosecutor also had recused himself from the case and that a state attorney from Jacksonville would take over the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Scott announced that the local state attorney, Norman Wolfinger, had recused himself from the case. In a letter to Scott, Wolfinger said that while he thought he could fairly oversee any prosecution that develops in the case, his recusal was aimed at &quot;toning down the rhetoric and preserving the integrity of the investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fullen said he felt ensuring the integrity of the legality of the case was crucial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This needs to be dealt with, but it needs to be done legally,&quot; he said. &quot;And not just locally, but at the national level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look at the crowds -- they are every color and all walks of life. The people are not going to stand by and let this continue,&quot; he said. &quot;You can see and hear that America is sick and tired of this kind of hatred.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 26--NEW YORK -- New details in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case indicate that the teen fought with George Zimmerman before the neighborhood watch captain shot and killed Martin. It may add credence to Zimmerman's claim that he was acting in self defense, while other new information sheds light on why Martin, who was supposed to be in school in South Florida, was instead 200 miles away from home when he was fatally shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They killed my son and now they're trying to kill his reputation,&quot; Sybrina Foster, Trayvon's mother, said in a midday news conference in Sanford, Florida. &quot;Even in death,&quot; Trayvon's father Tracy Martin added, &quot;They're still disrespecting my son.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both parents were responding to the new details leaking out -- possibly from local police -- about the situation in which Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, was killed. When Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, shot Martin exactly a month ago, Trayvon had been suspended from his school in South Florida, and was visiting his father's fiancee's townhome in Sanford, in Central Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ten-day suspension from Dr. Michael M. Krop Secondary School in North Miami was imposed after a baggie with marijuana residue on it was found in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's backpack. The Miami-Dade School District has said, through a spokesperson that Martin's violation at his high school did not involve any violence. Miami-Dade County authorities also confirmed that Martin did not have a juvenile criminal record, after various news outlets requested the information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his shooting death, a toxicology test was done on Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's body, the results of which are pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's ask why there was testing on the victim, and not on the man who was the aggressor,&quot; Rev. Al Sharpton said at the news conference in reference to the fact that Sanford Police seized no evidence from George Zimmerman after he said he had to shoot Trayvon in self defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That lack of confiscation was in spite of the fact that newly available details Zimmerman and from witnesses, obtained by PIX11 news partner The Orlando Sentinel, show that Martin may have punched Zimmerman in the nose and bashed Zimmerman's head on the pavement multiple times. The alleged beatdown happened after Zimmerman, who'd determined the hoodie-wearing teen was suspicious, followed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, against the recommendation of police, and Martin questioned Zimmerman about why he was trailing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also new: nearly three-quarters of all Americans -- 73 percent, believe George Zimmerman should be arrested, according to a new CNN/ORC International poll. It also found that 67 percent of whites feel that the 28 year-old who was let go by cops should be under arrest, and 83 percent of non-whites feel that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, an African-American friend of Zimmerman, Joe Oliver, has been speaking widely in defense of Zimmerman. &quot;This was not a racial incident,&quot; Oliver said in an interview with CNN. &quot;It was an incident where someone was trying to do the right thing and ended up in a very bad position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver even took his message to Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is in Florida to support Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's Family. That family received a very public message on Monday from the special prosecutor in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon's parents deserve answers,&quot; Angela Corey said in an interview. &quot;And we're going to do our best to give them those answers in a timely fashion.&quot; Corey also said over the past weekend that this case is difficult, and it may be a challenge to get a conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 26--KALAMAZOO -- One month has passed since the killing of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed Florida teenager who was shot by a volunteer neighborhood watchman as he walked to his dad's fiance's house.  So far, the watchman hasn't been charged or even arrested, sparking outrage and protests across the nation including in Kalamazoo, Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of students marched the Western Michigan University campus, protesting Martin's killing and demanding the man who shot him, George Zimmerman, be held accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People in cities across the nation held marches despite new evidence in the case that could show there's more to the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was no reason to approach that young man other than saying he fit a description or that he had some type of threat.  He had no type of threat,&quot; said Ra'jae Adams, a WMU student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many feel Zimmerman targeted Martin because he thought the teen's hooded sweatshirt looked suspicious.  Others feel race also played a roll since Martin was black and Zimmerman is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two-hundred hoodie-clad students carried signs about skittles and iced tea, the only things the teen was carrying when Zimmerman shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very important to keep everyone aware, to let people know what's going on and to let people know how we feel when justice isn't served,&quot; said Ryan Gassaway, a WMU student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a movement,&quot; said Ashley Hampton, a WMU student.  &quot;A child was killed unlawfully and justice has not been served.  The man who killed him is walking around freely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national outrage is due to the fact Zimmerman hasn't been arrested.  New details show there may be more to the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was on a 10-day suspension from school and police found marijuana on him after his death.  Further, a police report leaked to the Florida media said Zimmerman told police Martin attacked him first, hitting him several times and knocking him down.  The same report said Zimmerman was bleeding when police arrived on scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's family has called Zimmerman's story outrageous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not asking for an eye for an eye.  We're asking for justice, justice, justice,&quot; said Tracy Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have maintained they can't arrest Zimmerman under Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which allows people to defend themselves using deadly force if there is a reasonable fear of death of serious injury.  Meanwhile, Florida's governor has formed a task force to review the law in conjunction with the U.S. Justice Department.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 26--Monday, March 26th a demonstration will be held in Indianapolis, demanding justice for 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The innocence of Trayvon has captured the heart of a lot of people out there. The fact that all he had was candy and a drink, I think that kind of captured his innocence,&quot; Emily Caldwell said. Caldwell organized Monday's demonstration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was killed as he walked back from a Florida convenience store. He wore a hoodie. He was unarmed. Neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, claims he acted in self-defense when he shot Martin in late February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What if that was my brother? If he went to get something from the gas station and he never came home,&quot; 12-year-old Idris Foster asked. Foster is Caldwell's son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Idris Foster and his 14-year-old brother, Joseph, heard about what happened and wanted something to be done. &quot;I felt that someone should do something about it 'cause my mom always taught me if something goes wrong stand up for yourself,&quot; Idris Foster said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local brothers wrote signs, which read: &quot;Please don't shoot me. I only have skittles and a drink. I am Trayvon&quot;. The pictures of the brothers holding the signs were posted onCNN'swebsite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All I have is skittles and tea. It's like showing how innocent he was. He wasn't trying to harm anybody,&quot; Joseph Foster believed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Idris Foster encouraged his mother, Emily Caldwell, to make something happen. Caldwell created a Facebook page, demanding justice. &quot;I want to see people make a commitment to this whole movement and keep it going,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She asked Hoosiers to march for Martin. &quot;When I see this response I realize I'm not the only mother that sits there and wonders if their kids are going to come back in the house,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 10,000 people have been invited to Monday's march in Indianapolis. People who want to participate are encouraged to meet at Crispus Attucks High School (1140 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Street) at 4:30p.m. Monday, March 26th. The group will then walk about a mile to the American Legion Mall. The group will demonstrate there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We as a nation are watching. We as a world are watching and you're not going to continue to be able to kill our sons and get away with [this],&quot; Caldwell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think its great to get the word out there and like to let people know that just because someone looks a certain way that you shouldn't judge them,&quot; Joseph Foster said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlantans rally for slain Florida teen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 protesters gathered Thursday at an Atlanta church for a rally and worship service before heading south to protest the shooting death of Florida teen Trayvon Martin. After the early morning service, the protesters boarded buses that took the group from First Iconium Baptist Church to Sanford, Fla., just north of Orlando, to take part in a bigger rally led by the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 17-year-old Martin, who was walking to his father's house after at trip to a convenience store, was shot by volunteer neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman. Zimmerman said he killed Martin, who was unarmed, in self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's death has sparked a nationwide outcry, with protestors demanding Zimmerman be arrested. It also has prompted debates on issues of race and racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teacher says he was bullied into cheating</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parks Middle School teacher Damien Northern, one of the two educators to resign last week amid the cheating scandal, described the culture of Atlanta Public Schools as &quot;morally bankrupt.&quot; In a statement written to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Northern said he is a victim of the school system and was forced into a compromising position. He said he feared the consequences of reporting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern and fellow teacher Cheryl Hunt quit their jobs rather than face a panel that was to have decided their fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COBB</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission rejects Vinings zoning change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cobb County commissioners gave a unanimous &quot;no&quot; Tuesday to a zoning change request in the Vinings area. The change would have allowed the construction of a midrise apartment complex, proposed by Walton Communities. The rejection aligned with nearby residents' views that the 262-unit, 23.5-acre complex would be out of place in an area of single family homes. Denial of the zoning change also was recommended by the Cobb Planning Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEKALB</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County promises animal shelter changes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facing pressure from residents and a citizen's task force, DeKalb officials said Tuesday they are committed to changing how the county animal shelter is operated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burrell Ellis, the county's chief executive, said he is eyeing locations to build a new shelter and trying figure out how to come up with the estimated $4 million to $8 million it would cost. More immediate plans include installing air conditioning at the current shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the county has made improvements in the decade since it acknowleged issues with the shelter, a task force formed last year said the shelter was still a &quot;chamber of horrors,&quot; citing bug infestations and mold problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GWINNETT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Man charged in Norcross-area rapes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DNA analysis has linked a man to the rapes of two Gwinnett women, police say. The suspect, 27-year-old Jerson Antonio Gomez, already in prison, is charged with similar crimes in Bartow County. Gwinnett police said Wednesday he now faces additional charges in connection with the Norcross-area attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 2008, a 28-year-old woman reported walking along Singleton Road when a man attempted to rob her at knifepoint before raping her. A month later, a 51-year-old woman reported being raped by a man with a pistol after she returned home to find him in her bedroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NORTHSIDE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge tosses lawsuit for dissolution of cities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judge has thrown out a lawsuit that sought to dissolve five cities in DeKalb and Fulton counties. The suit, filed by the Legislative Black Caucus, said the state didn't follow the proper legislative process when incorporating Dunwoody, Sandy Springs, Johns Creek, Milton and Chattahoochee Hills. By forming the &quot;super-majority white&quot; cities, the state weakened the minority vote in those areas and the 14th and 15th Amendments, as well as the Voting Rights Act, the caucus claimed in its lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In dismissing the suit, U.S. District Judge Timothy C. Batten Sr. said the caucus' proposal to dissolve the new cities was illogical. An attorney for the caucus said he was shocked by the judge's decision but that the caucus planned to appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTHSIDE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Odor of pot leads to fraud charges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">College Park police said the smell of marijuana at a hotel led them to something even more shady. Following up on a hotel guest's complaints of the odor, officers said they uncovered not only pot, but an apparent identity-theft ring. They said they found three men holed up in the room with stolen debit and credit cards, a patient list from a medical facility and tax returns. Authorities said Antonio Mitchell, Jerrold Malone and Calvin Neal are charged with multiple counts of financial-transaction fraud. Mitchell also faces one count of marijuana possession and a probation violation charge, Clayton County Jail records show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Report lists state's lagging schools</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a report released Tuesday by the Georgia Department of Education, 156 schools in the state need extra attention to address disparities in achievement and graduation rates. The schools, designated &quot;focus&quot; schools, include 15 in Clayton County; 10 each in DeKalb and Fulton counties; seven apiece for APS and Gwinnett; five in Cobb; and two for Marietta city schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus designation is one of three new performance designations public schools in Georgia and other states that received waivers under No Child Left Behind. &quot;Focus,&quot; &quot;priority&quot; and &quot;reward&quot; replace the old &quot;needs improvement&quot; and &quot;adequate yearly progress&quot; designations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate passes tax reform bill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Bill 386, a sweeping, 50-page plan to change nearly every section of tax law, will soon be law after getting its final approval from the Senate on Thursday. The bill, which passed with a vote of 54-0, was introduced Monday and passed the House on Tuesday. It includes tax cuts for airlines, manufacturers and married couples. It also eliminates the car tax Georgia motorists pay on their birthdays.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calls for justice build in Fla. killing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorneys for the family of Trayvon Martin and the Florida neighborhood watch captain who fatally shot the unarmed African-American teen joined the national chorus of voices calling Saturday for justice in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As demonstrators took to the streets in Washington, Chicago and other major cities to voice outrage over Martin's death and the local police investigation of it, an attorney for the Martin family told board members of the National Association of Black Journalists that federal and local officials have assured the family that the case is a priority. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, an attorney representing the neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, broadly defended his client and said he believes evidence will show that a Florida law allowing use of deadly force against an attacker was properly applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has not been charged in the Feb. 26 shooting that has ignited racial tensions and raised questions about the handling of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EAST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No smoke detector in fire that killed 8</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fire tore through a two-story home that had no functioning smoke detectors in Charleston, W. Va., killing eight family members, including six children, Mayor Danny Jones said. He said he believed it was the city's deadliest fire in at least six decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Search for missing toddler renewed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the ground clear of winter's snow, about 100 searchers aided by tracking dogs renewed their search for a Maine toddler who's been missing for three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say Ayla Reynolds' father, Justin DiPietro, and two other adults in the home on the night the girl disappeared haven't been totally forthcoming, and some of the girl's blood was found in her father's bedroom. No charges have been filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Planes believed to have collided</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pilot whose plane crashed was conscious when people ripped off the door of her Cessna 180 to pull her to safety, but authorities said two people in the other plane were killed. That crash and another of single-engine planes north of Denver, which occurred minutes apart, are being investigated as a possible midair collision, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mike Fergus said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two people who died appeared to be males and were believed to be an instructor pilot and a student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama pushes highway aid bill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama wants Congress to end a showdown that threatens to cut off federal highway and transit aid to states just as the spring construction season starts. In his weekly radio and Internet address, Obama encouraged voters to pressure Democrats and Republicans to pass a long-term transportation bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the economy will take a hit otherwise as construction projects sit idle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama reiterated the White House call for Congress to adopt the two-year, $109 billion bill the Senate approved easily last week. House Republicans are divided over a five-year, $260 billion package.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Republican address in response, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the time is now to repeal the president's health care act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ELSEWHERE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Station astronauts duck space junk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A discarded chunk of a Russian rocket missed the International Space Station early Saturday. However, it came close enough to force six astronauts to seek shelter in escape capsules. It was the third time in 12 years that astronauts have had to seek shelter from space junk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Film director ready for deep-sea dive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A submarine that will take &quot;Titanic&quot; director James Cameron to the Earth's deepest point has made a successful unmanned test dive to a depth of 7 miles. Cameron is headed to the test dive site, and if all goes well, he plans to spend about six hours exploring and filming the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest spot in Earth's oceans. Swiss engineer Jacques Piccard and U.S. Navy Capt. Don Walsh, in a 1960 dive, are the only men to have reached the spot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. (AP) - Authorities say a Florida man is charged with threatening the police chief who had been overseeing the investigation into the shooting death of an unarmed black teen by a neighborhood watch captain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Seminole County Sheriff's Office said John Carnduff Stewart of Melbourne Beach emailed Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee on Friday, saying Lee and his family should be killed. Melbourne Beach is nearly 70 miles south of Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sheriff's office says Stewart has sent threatening emails previously, including threats to Penn State University assistant football coach Mike McQueary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stewart was placed on electronic monitoring as a condition of his $10,000 bond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee temporarily stepped down as chief amid national outrage over the investigation. The neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, has not been charged in Trayvon Martin's death.</SPAN></P>

Photo: REUTERS US PRESIDENT Barack Obama has stepped into the growing controversy over the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, telling a news conference that America has some &quot;soul searching&quot; to do over the killing of the unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President, who previously described Trayvon's death as a &quot;local issue,&quot; said yesterday that he empathised with the parents of the boy, who was shot last month by a neighbourhood vigilante in suburban Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son he'd look like Trayvon. They are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves and that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama's decision to speak out about Trayvon's killing, in such personal terms, represents a calculated gamble. Although the case has sparked international outrage, it also risks widening racial divides in an election year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, who was 17 and had no criminal record, was shot on February 26 as he walked from a convenience store to the home of his father's girlfriend, in a gated community in the commuter town of Sanford, just outside Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police did not arrest his killer, a local vigilante called George Zimmerman, apparently accepting at face value that he had acted in self- defence, and claiming that a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law enacted in Florida at the behest of the gun lobby would prevent his successful prosecution. In the aftermath of the killing, it has emerged that they discounted the evidence of several witnesses, and misleadingly told the media that Mr Zimmerman, 28, was a &quot;squeaky clean&quot; individual with no criminal record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It subsequently emerged that he had a previous arrest for battery and had been accused of domestic violence. In the past year, he had called emergency services almost 50 times to complain about &quot;suspicious persons&quot; in his neighbourhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of them turned out to be black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his 911 call on the night of Trayvon's death, he appeared to use a racial slur to describe his eventual victim as a &quot;f---ing coon&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he was never asked why he used a 9mm pistol to ward off a child who weighed at least 45kilograms less than him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford's chief of police has resigned, pending a review of his department, which has faced widespread accusations of racial bias in this and several other cases. Mr Zimmerman, who was described by police as a &quot;white male&quot; but claims to be Hispanic, is now in hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his remarks, Mr Obama suggested that Trayvon's death ought to prompt states such as Florida to reconsider &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws, which have led to scores of murder cases being abandoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative to investigate every aspect of this and that everybody pulls together - federal, state and local - to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened,&quot; he said. &quot;I think all of us have to do some soul searching ... And that means we examine the laws, the context for what happened, as well as the specifics of the incident.&quot; Independent</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI (AP) - Attorneys for the family of Trayvon Martin and the Florida neighborhood watch captain who fatally shot the unarmed teen joined the national chorus of voices calling Saturday for justice in the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As demonstrators took to the streets in major cities such as Washington and Chicago to voice outrage over Martin's death and the local police investigation of it, an attorney for the Martin family told board members of the National Association of Black Journalists that federal and local officials have assured the family that the case is a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, an attorney representing the neighborhood watch captain, 28-year-old George Zimmerman, broadly defended his client and said he believes evidence will show that Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law was properly applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has not been charged in the Feb. 26 shooting that has ignited racial tensions and raised questions about the Sanford police's handling of the case. Martin was black, and Zimmerman's father is white and his mother is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is George a racist? The answer is no, absolutely not. He's not a racist,&quot; attorney Craig Sonner said about his client. &quot;The incident that transpired is not racially motivated or a hate crime in any way. It was self-defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonner declined to detail what transpired between Zimmerman and the 17-year-old Martin, but he said he believes the case falls under Florida's stand-your-ground law, which dictates that a person has the right to stand his or her ground and &quot;meet force with force&quot; if attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If charges are brought against his client, Zimmerman would be willing to turn himself in to police, Sonner said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For every black man in America, from the millionaire in the corner office to the mechanic in the local garage, the Trayvon Martin tragedy is personal. It could have been me or one of my sons. It could have been any of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many George Zimmermans are out there cruising the streets? How many guys with chips on their shoulders and itchy fingers on the triggers of loaded handguns? How many self-imagined guardians of the peace who say the words &quot;black male&quot; with a sneer? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't yet know every detail of the incident between Martin and Zimmerman in Sanford, Fla., that ended with an unarmed 17-year-old high-school student being shot dead. But we know enough to conclude that this is an old, familiar story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know from tapes of Zimmerman's 911 call that he initiated the encounter, having decided that Martin's presence in the neighborhood was suspicious. We know that when Zimmerman told the 911 operator that he was following Martin, the operator responded, &quot;OK, we don't need you to do that.&quot; We know that Zimmerman kept following Martin anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy looks like he is up to no good,&quot; Zimmerman said on the 911 tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please tell me, what would be the innocent way to walk down the street with an iced tea and some Skittles? Hint: For black men, that's a trick question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some commentators have sought to liken Martin's killing to the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, an unspeakable crime that helped galvanize the civil rights movement. To make a facile comparison is a disservice to history -- and to the memory of both young men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Till was killed in Mississippi at 14 -- accused of flirting with a white woman -- this was a different country. State-sanctioned terrorism and assassination were official policy throughout the South. Today, the laws and institutions that enforced Jim Crow repression have long since been dismantled. Mississippi, of all places, has more black elected officials than any other state. An African-American family lives in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black America was never a monolith but over the past five decades it has become much more diverse -- economically, socially, culturally. If you stood on a street corner and chose five black men at random, you might meet a doctor who lives in the high-priced suburbs, an immigrant from Ethiopia who drives a cab, a young aspiring filmmaker with flowing dreadlocks, an unemployed dropout trying to hustle his next meal, and a midlevel government worker struggling to put his kids through college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those men would have nothing in common, really, except one thing: For each of them, walking down the wrong street at the wrong time could be a fatal mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hear from people who contend that racism no longer exists in this country. I tell them I wish they were right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, young black men grow up in a society where racism is no longer deemed acceptable. Many live in integrated neighborhoods, have interracial relationships. They wonder why their parents prattle on so tediously about race, warning about this or that or the other, when their own youthful experience tells them that race doesn't matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What could happen on the way home from the store with some Skittles and an iced tea? Whether Zimmerman can or should be prosecuted, given Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law providing broad latitude to claim self-defense, is an important question. But the tragic and essential thing, for me, is the bull's-eye that black men wear throughout their lives -- and the vital imperative to never, ever, be caught on the wrong street at the wrong time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NEW Black Panther Party offered a bounty of $10,000 Saturday for the &quot;capture&quot; of a Florida neighborhood watch captain who killed unarmed teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,&quot; leader Mikhail Muhammad said after announcing the reward for George Zimmerman at a protest in Sanford, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad called on 5,000 black men to mobilize and capture the neighborhood watch volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the government won't do the job, we'll do it,&quot; Muhammad said, leading chants that included &quot;freedom or death&quot; and &quot;justice for Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New Black Panther spokesman said the group is hoping to collect $1 million from outraged supporters to set up its own &quot;ministry of defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just as some neighborhoods have a neighborhood watch, we believe that we have to have our own neighborhood watch in the black community in order to protect ourselves,&quot; spokesman Chawn Kweli told the Daily News. New Black Panthers members pointed to what they called the inaction of government officials - from Sanford city officials up to the governor - and accused them of lying and delaying justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also said Angela Corley, the newly appointed special prosecutor, was an enemy of the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She has a track record of sending innocent young black men and women to prison,&quot; Muhammad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Southern Poverty Law Center calls the New Black Panther Party, a black-separatist group created in 1989, &quot;virulently racist and anti-Semitic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, a 17-year-old African-American, was wearing a hoodie and carrying a pack of Skittles and an ice tea on the night of Feb. 26. He was heading back to his father's fianc&eacute;'s townhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 28, called 911 to report a suspicious person in the gated community and followed the teen despite the dispatcher's request that he stand down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman said he shot Martin in self-defense. Zimmerman's family says he is Hispanic and race was not an issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have no more idea what happened in Florida between Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and George Zimmerman than I do the price of cheese on Jupiter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I only know 17-year-old Trayvon is dead and the nation is up in arms about it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a month late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But thanks to his determined family, the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin now has our undivided attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too bad that never happened for L.A.'s murdered children, 14-year-old Cheryl Green, 23-day-old Baby Luis and our own 17-year-old Jamiel Shaw II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm with the millions who can't understand how local authorities swallowed Zimmerman's story. This isn't a courageous stand. Insisting on Zimmerman's presumption of innocence - now that takes a set of brass ones!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, is it possible Zimmerman sincerely feared for his life when he shot Trayvon dead? I guess. I wasn't there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But like you, I've heard the 911 tapes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I heard Zimmerman phone in the movements of his quarry to a police dispatcher, nearly hyperventilating from the adrenaline rush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I heard the dispatcher tell Zimmerman to stop following Trayvon, &quot;We don't need you to do that... Stay in your car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to conceive how an experienced neighborhood watch captain - packing heat no less - with the protection of his vehicle available while on the phone with the police somehow managed to stumble into a &quot;life-threaten- ing&quot; situation with anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's actions seem ripped from the pages of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; or even this weekend's blockbuster, &quot;The Hunger Games,&quot; both stories featuring human prey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin - and it requires all my willpower to not call it murder - rips at the scab of America's deepest psychic wound, race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That George Zimmerman is himself multi-ethnic - part white, part Hispanic - is irrelevant. The blunt, non-PC truth is young, black lives come cheap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after decades of civil rights legislation, affirmative action, hate crimes laws, our first African-American president and the Civil War itself, we still accept a shockingly high mortality rate among young blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, as the fury over Trayvon's death finally forced his story on to the big TV networks and thus into our consciousness, the city of Chicago saw 10 killed, including a 6-year-old girl, and a staggering 39 wounded!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where's the outrage over that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 10 killed, 39 wounded are just statistics. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is a cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His death provides fresh meat for the loathsome political opportunists left and right who are exploiting this tragedy to score cheap points at the polls in November and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman will be charged with something for killing Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because the nation demands it. And needs it. We need to know what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Especially if, somehow, it turns out Zimmerman really is innocent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATLANTA - Her sons were 12 and 8 when Marlyn Tillman realized it was time to have the talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buying a water gun was perfectly acceptable for their white friends only. As young African-American men, she told them, owning a water gun could make them an easy target for police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I could no longer keep them in the dark,&quot; Tillman said. &quot;I had to break it to them that the world sees them differently.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, homicide was the leading cause of death for black males age 12-19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the weeks since young Tray-von Martin was gunned down in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., those truths have weighed heavily on black parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tillman, a community activist and empty nester, lives in a middle-class, predominately white, suburban Atlanta neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruben Brown, 48, lives with his wife and son in Atlanta. But like Tillman, he knows their middle-class status in no way equals safety when it comes to his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although worries about the safety of adolescents are not the province of just black families or parents of boys, Tillman, Brown and other parents say raising black boys is perhaps the most stressful aspect of parenting because they know they're dealing with a society that is fearful and hostile toward them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 14, Brown said his son is at that critical age when he's always worried about his safety because of profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to scare him or have him paint people with a broad brush, but, historically, we black males have been stigmatized as the purveyors of crime and wherever we are, we're suspect,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black parents who don't make that fact clear, he and others said, do it at their and their male children's own peril.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any African-American parent not having that conversation is being irresponsible,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morehouse College associate professor Bryant Marks agreed, saying parents need to be vigilant in raising their boys, make them aware of how they are perceived in this country and give them the skills they need to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have the conversation about the police, tell them what to do when they are on foot or in a car,&quot; he said. &quot;That conversation needs to happen. It acknowledges the bias out there, but let them know that they can succeed in spite of all of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of a family's class or education, the challenge of bringing young black males safely to adulthood must be tremendous, said Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the one hand, should they tell children to run when they are faced with suspicious and possibly dangerous circumstances such as a car following them, or should they stand still for fear that their running will be interpreted as some sort of evidence of guilt,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a horrible, horrible Catch 22 for any parent or child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as Cohen is concerned, the moral of the tragedy in Sanford is &quot;walking while black - merely being black - still seems to be a crime in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on news reports, he said, George Zimmerman appears to have concluded that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was &quot;suspicious&quot; based on nothing more than his race and the fact that Trayvon was walking in Zimmerman's neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sadly, such assumptions are made about black youth every day,&quot; Cohen said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. - Members of the New Black Panther Party are offering a $10,000 reward for the &quot;capture&quot; of George Zimmerman, leader Mikhail Muhammad announced during a protest in Sanford Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly saying: &quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bounty announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilization of 5,000 black men to capture George Zimmerman, the Neighborhood Watch volunteer who shot Trayvon Martin last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland and Jacksonville - where the 28-year-old worked before the shooting, employees there told the Orlando Sentinel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad said the group's national chairman, Dr. Malik Zulu Shabaz of Washington, D.C., is receiving donations from black entertainers and athletes. They hope to collect $1 million, Muhammad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group called for Zimmerman's arrest and threatened to find and detain him if police were not willing to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party members said they are tired of the inaction of government officials - from Sanford city officials up to the governor, accusing them of lying and delaying justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Southern Poverty Law Center says the New Black Panther Party is &quot;virulently racist and anti-Semitic,&quot; and its leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews and law officers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever since he made &quot;take my talents&quot; a punch line, ever since he floundered in NBA Finals news conferences as if he were Captain Queeg, ever since he forgot about his fans and where he came from, basketball's best player has become a PR nightmare. Your mouth opens when he plays, and your mouth opens when he opens his mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But LeBron James did something positive this past week with his public platform. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, the story of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin has become national news -- the 17-year-old African-American Florida native was wearing a hooded sweat shirt when he was approached by a man named George Zimmerman, who was a neighborhood watch volunteer. Martin was unarmed, simply walking home from a convenience store. A confrontation ensued, and Zimmerman shot Martin to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing has sparked a debate about racial profiling. So James posted a photo on his Twitter account (he has more than 4 million followers). The photo featured the Miami Heat players all wearing sweat shirt hoods over their heads. Using hashtags to provide commentary, James wrote: #WeAreTrayvonMartin #Hoodies #Stereotyped #WeWantJustice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a powerful image -- celebrity sports heroes proclaiming that they are no different from those who might be stereotyped in our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama spoke out about the Martin tragedy, saying on Friday, the same day as the LeBron tweet, &quot;I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My main message is to the parents of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves and we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to athletes taking a political stand, arguably none took a more powerful stand than on the stand, at the 1968 Olympics. Tommie Smith and John Carlos, U.S. Olympians, stood on the medal stand during the national anthem and punched the sky with fists covered in black gloves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the 2008 Olympics, I wrote an extensive feature about the &quot;silent gesture heard around the world,&quot; as Smith described it to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1968, the world was different. As famed sociologist Harry Edwards said in that piece: &quot;You had a country that was in turmoil. Against the background of a burgeoning civil rights movement and black power movement, it made sense to me that athletes had a role, and an obligation, to move the ball up the field.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, we don't see stuff like this today. I remember during my interviews for that story, a common sentiment was that in the modern era, not only are the political issues not as boiling, but the modern athlete (the millionaire celebrity spokesperson) has too much to risk by taking a polarizing political stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a situation such as with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, this gave James a chance to make a point to the masses. It was cool. It was refreshing to see an athlete of his stature try to educate, to help change America's perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And social media makes it simple to spread a message. Heat teammate Dwyane Wade posted a photo on Facebook of himself in a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a father,&quot; Wade told the South Florida Sun Sentinel. &quot;It's support of the tragic thing that has taken place. No matter what color, race, we're all fathers. When you think about what that family's going through, it hits you hard and it hurts your heart to think about it. Just anything you can do -- obviously we can't bring him back -- but anything you can do to get behind and support is what we're doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spotlight on ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rough week for NBA Coloradans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a tough seven days for three area products in the NBA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, there was the Hornets' Jason Smith (Platte Valley High School, CSU), who went all Avalanche on Blake Griffin, body-checking the all-star and thus receiving a two-game suspension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down in Oklahoma City, rookie Reggie Jackson (Palmer High) had been the Thunder's backup point guard until OKC acquired veteran Derek Fisher this past week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And poor Chauncey Billups (who was averaging 15 points per game) can only sit and watch as his Clippers free fall in the Western Conference standings. Since Billups went down with his Achilles injury, the Clippers are 11-14, even losing a game to the lowly Hornets. (Hey, at least Monarch High's Louis Amundson is getting some clock for Indiana.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Smith's hit, it looked terrible. Bush league. But Smith defended himself to reporters: &quot;I think it looked a lot worse than what it was, but that's still not a play that you ever want to do to another player like that. I apologize to Blake Griffin. I didn't want to hurt him at all. I just wanted to try and cut off his lane to the basket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For New Orleans this season, Smith has nearly doubled his scoring from last season, averaging 8.7 points per game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson averaged 3.4 points in 11.8 minutes, but Saturday he was assigned to the NBA Development League.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 25--The images are so stark, all those people wearing hoodies in pictures for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Former Gov. Jennifer Granholm. The Miami Heat. Random friends and neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're all trying to bring badly needed attention to a face-slapping injustice: A white man kills an innocent black teen he unnecessarily feared in an Orlando suburb, and police and prosecutors won't even take the shooter into custody, much less charge him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I get it. I'm angry, too. And scared for kids like my son, who'll be a teenager soon enough -- and seen as a threat by some people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I'm also wondering: What have we done for Delric? Or Kade'jah? Or Je'Rean?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were black kids, too. They were innocent. And they were killed for stupid, stupid reasons right here in Detroit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it because their killings had nothing to do with racism that their deaths didn't evoke such passion or spark nationwide social media campaigns?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does combatting racial stereotypes -- which is about fighting one of the black community's external foes -- command an easier mental and emotional response than confronting the demons that exist between and among African Americans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me be clear here: I'm not trying to let anyone off the hook in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's outrageous that George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, got out of his vehicle when he saw Trayvon walking through his gated Sanford community, confronted the teen and then shot him after a scuffle. That's not any kind of neighborhood watch I've ever heard of -- it's barbarous vigilantism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But every day in this country, a black teen or child gets gunned down in encounters that are at least as perplexing. It has become so common, it's nauseating. And far more typically, the perpetrators are other African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delric Miller IV was a 9-month-old, sleeping on the couch in a home on Detroit's west side, when someone fired 37 rounds from an automatic weapon through the windows and walls, killing him instantly. His grandmother said she believes the attack was retaliation for a fight over chairs at a baby shower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve-year-old Kade'jah Davis was killed when someone fired shots through the front door of her home, supposedly by a man who had argued with her mother over a cell phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Je'Rean Blake was a 17-year-old standing on a corner on the city's east side, talking to a girl, when a man on a moped took exception to the look on his face. The man returned to the corner with a gun and shot twice into a crowd where Je'Rean was standing, killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These deaths were beyond senseless. And they happen all the time -- in Detroit and in other communities, big and small.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They don't raise the same kinds of questions as Trayvon's killing, questions about how virulent racial stereotypes still are in some quarters, or about how easily authorities brush off cold-blooded murder when a black kid is the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I think they raise far more serious questions about how we, as African Americans, deal with one another, how we value life and manage disputes, and how far we've allowed our communities to sink into moral chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've got everyone donning a hoodie to bring justice to Trayvon's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for the most part, when it's just another black kid killed by other black people, the emotions aren't nearly as raw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are, of course, bold exceptions. My friend Raphael Johnson, who heads the Detroit 300 neighborhood anti-crime group (which some worry is veering into vigilantism, too) works tirelessly to bring attention to the routine debasing of life in poor, black areas. So do lots of other people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they work in relative obscurity compared to the attention being garnered by Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death. It seems they can't get Americans of any hue as exercised about what they see every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family deserves justice, and that justice will mean something huge for a nation that still can't get race relations right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when that's done, it's worth asking when the far more common killings of black children will generate as much outrage and deserve as much attention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 25--An Iraqi-American woman who used to live in Dearborn was found beaten to death at her home near San Diego in what might possibly be a hate crime. A note calling her a terrorist and saying she should go back to her country was left next to her body, according to friends and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death on Saturday of Shaima Alawadi, 32, after three days in the hospital has prompted an intense outpouring of anxiety and outrage from some, especially among Arab-Americans and on social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. Some drew comparisons with the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an African-American teen shot dead last month in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm really disturbed,&quot; said Suehaila Amen, president of the Lebanese-American Heritage Club in Dearborn. &quot;It's quite frightening.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body of Alawadi, a U.S. citizen, is currently being prepared to be flown to Iraq for her funeral, said Imam Husham Al-Husainy, of the Karbalaa Islamic Education Center in Dearborn. Her father, Sayed Nabeel Alawadi, is a Shia cleric in Iraq, whose government will pay for shipping expenses of the body, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is outraged,&quot; Al-Husainy told the Free Press. &quot;This is too evil, too criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police told the San Diego Union-Tribune they are investigating her death in El Cajon, near San Diego, as a homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A hate crime is one of the possibilities, and we will be looking at that,&quot; Lt. Mark Coit of El Cajon police told the Union-Tribune. &quot;We don't want to focus on only one issue and miss something else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alawadi, a mother of five born in Iraq, was found by her 17-year-old daughter on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I found her on the floor...in her own blood with a letter next to hear head saying go back to your country you terrorist,&quot; Fatima Al Himidi, told 10News, a TV station serving the San Diego area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a week ago, the woman's family had received a separate, similar note that read:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're a terrorist. You should move back to your country,&quot; Hayder Al-Zayadi, a friend of the family, told the Free Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people are not educated,&quot; Al-Zayadi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alawadi was born in Iraq and moved to the U.S. in 1993 along with her family, part of a wave of Shia Muslim refugees who fled to metro Detroit after former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein cracked down on an uprising in 1991. After living in Dearborn for a few years, she moved to the San Diego area in 1996, graduated from high school, and was a housewife raising five kids at the time of her death, according to Al-Zayadi. El Cajon has a growing Iraqi-American population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's such a respectful person,&quot; he said. &quot;When she was in the hospital (after the beating), Christian, Muslim, Jewish, all nationalities, were there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her brothers worked as cultural advisers for the U.S. Army to help train soldiers who were deployed to the Middle East, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaima wore a hijab, an Islamic headscarf. When she received the earlier threatening note, she ignored it, assuming it was a harmless joke, her daughter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A week ago they left a letter saying this is our country not yours you terrorist, and so my mom ignored that thinking it was just kids playing a prank,&quot; she told the TV station. &quot;But the day they hit her, they left another note again, and it said the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of El Cajon has a growing Arab-American population. Last night in Arab-American communities, &quot;everybody was talking about&quot; the death of Alawadi, Amen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 33, Amen is roughly the same age as Alawadi and also wears a hijab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is something that's really scary,&quot; Amen said. &quot;For a woman like myself who wears a hijab, you're an open target. You're always looking over your shoulder because of how you're dressed and because someone might have skewed perceptions of the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On social media sites, people expressed concern she was killed because of her ethnicity and religion. Some compared her to Martin, the African-American teenager killed in Florida who was wearing a hoodie. They say that both were minorities killed, one for a hoodie, the other for a hijab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Facebook page was created Saturday called: &quot;One Million Hijabs for Shaima Alawadi.&quot; Hijabis is a term sometimes used by Muslims for women who wear hijabs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facebook page reads: &quot;She could be your daughter, your sister, your friend. We cannot let the children in this country grow up in a world so full of hatred that a woman wearing a head scarf is afraid for her life, that a black kid wearing a hoodie is afraid for his life... We are all Shaima. We need a Million Hijab March.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Facebook page, the words &quot;this oufit doesn't say 'kill me' on the label&quot; is on a photo of a woman wearing a hijab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaima's death drew a response from a range of people, including Rabbi Avraham Berkowitz, with the Orthodox Jewish group Chabad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wrote on Twitter this morning: &quot;Outrageous that this murder happened in the USA! May Shaima Alawadis murderer be found &amp; brought to justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Rieckhoff, the CEO of Iraq &amp; Afghan Vets of America, wrote on Twitter: &quot;As an Iraq vet, and as an American, I am beyond outraged by Shaima's death. This could have been so many of my friends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amen noted that the family of the woman had helped the U.S. Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How much more American can you get than to serve the country with pride and honor,&quot; Amen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shaima Al-Awadi's murder, like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's, was a senseless murder based upon racial animus,&quot; said Dawud Walid, an African-American Muslim leader from Detroit who is executive director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. &quot;We must come together as a society to have frank discussions about the toxic rhetorical environment which we currently live in that leads to such wanton violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The daughter of the mother told the TV station in San Diego:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's such an innocent woman. Why? Why did you do that?...We're not the terrorist. You are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community in the San Diego area will have three days of services for her at the Imam Ali Foundation Center, said Al-Zayadi.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Close to 1,000 people prayed, shouted and chanted during a downtown Jacksonville rally Saturday asking for criminal charges to be filed against the man who fatally shot teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Sanford last month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After walking from The Jacksonville Landing, the crowd gathered in the riverfront parking lot of the Duval County Courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were near the offices of State Attorney Angela Corey, whom Gov. Rick Scott assigned Thursday to investigate the killing as a special prosecutor, and much of their message was aimed at her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are looking at you. ... We expect you to do the right thing,&quot; Isaiah Rumlin, president of the Jacksonville branch NAACP said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Mia Jones, D-Jacksonville, told the crowd that &quot;in Jacksonville, this is a priority for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referencing Corey, she said that &quot;we need to show that we respect that she is hard on crime,&quot; Jones said. &quot;...&nbsp;We respect that she is for the victims. And the victim in this case is Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was shot by a volunteer in a neighborhood watch group while walking in a gated development. The volunteer, George Zimmerman, has argued he acted in self-defense after following Martin, although the teen was not armed and a police dispatcher had told Zimmerman not to follow him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was black. Zimmerman is Hispanic with a light complexion. People calling for Zimmerman's arrest argue he practiced a form of racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Benjamin Crump, who represents Martin's family, told the crowd they were part of a wave of demonstrations in Martin's memory by people of all races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a black or white thing. It's a right or wrong thing,&quot; he said during a light rain that scattered some demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the roll of speakers continued, participants held up signs including &quot;Americans Demand Justice&quot; and &quot;Trayvon was ran down and murdered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People expressed a range of concerns about public safety and race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are tired of 'just-us.' When people are arrested, it's always us,&quot; said Carolyn Walker, 73, who is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Foy, Jacksonville chapter president of the anti-crime group MAD DADS, said he was troubled to see a neighborhood watch effort invoked in defense of a shooting death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He overstepped his authority,&quot; Foy said of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linda Stacy, 65, who is white, said she identifies with Martin's family because she has grandchildren the same age and felt a need to speak against the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like if I don't do something to oppose it, I'm part of it,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONTARIO - An Ontario church joined worshippers, preachers and other churches to echo calls for justice in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager last month in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wearing hooded sweatshirts similar to the one that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin wore on the night he was killed, the tribute locally on March 25th came a day before the one-month anniversary of Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was shot while wearing a hooded sweatshirt as he walked home on a rainy night in a gated community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Neighborhood Watch volunteer who allegedly shot him, 28-year-old George Zimmerman, is the son of a white father and Hispanic mother. The demands to charge him in Martin's slaying have grown across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman had called police to report the hooded figure as suspicious - Martin was carrying a bag of Skittles, a can of iced tea and talking to his girlfriend on his cell phone. He was not charged</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has not been charged with any crime and is claiming self-defense under Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which eliminated a person's duty to retreat when threatened with serious bodily harm or death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Bethel United Church of Christ in downtown Ontario, Pastor Jonathon Edwards initially called on his small congregation to wear hoodies to the Sunday morning service in solidarity and respect to Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the request drew a better response than he expected, Edwards rewrote his sermon to focus on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin died because of our culture of being racist and that is a systemic issue,&quot; Edwards said. &quot;People of faith have a very important role in fixing this issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 30 people - a mix of churchgoers and members of the public - wore hoodies at Bethel on Sunday, Ontario resident Ruben Lopez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lopez said he is hoping the incident will spark a larger movement and get the public to address race issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's opening a dialogue for people, planting that see to get people talking,&quot; Lopez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of his sermon, Edwards said he made a plea to his congregation to &quot;undo&quot; the hate in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to end it because we don't want to have another Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Edwards said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edwards said he has been following the story closely, in part, because he is very sensitive to racial issues. The shooting has ignited racial tensions in many parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pastor, who grew up in South Africa during apartheid, said he has seen the consequences of race-related issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Racism is a front to keep people down,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edwards said he is also concerned about seeing racially motivated incidents occurring nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Living in downtown Ontario, Edwards said he sees the problems and conflicts between the Latino and white populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Edwards is also gay, and he says when he heard about the shooting, the incident hit close to home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see racism and homophobia as very similar,&quot; he said. &quot;I could have been Trayvon as a young teenager going out to get a drink.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Lopez learned about the shooting, he said he wanted to do more than sign an online petition or share a link on a social network site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lopez, who has been going to Bethel for two years, immediately got on board and spread the word about the Sunday service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a travesty, this kid has been murdered and his killer walks free,&quot; Lopez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sylvia Lee Mann, the music director at Bethel, described the news of the shooting as &quot;devastating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mann works with disadvantage youth and says that incident could have happened to any of her students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A hoodie is no reason for someone to feel threaten, it's just no reason,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's sermon as well as the display of hoodies was a chance to call attention to the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important for those of us who care to stand up and be counted,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An attorney representing the Neighborhood Watch captain broadly defended his client and said he believes evidence will show that Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law was properly applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has not been charged in the Feb. 26 shooting that has raised questions about the handling of the case by Sanford, Fla., police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the outcry over the lack of charges against Zimmerman, the Sanford police chief and state's attorney both have stepped aside.</SPAN></P>

Martin was slain in the town of Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26 in a shooting that has set off a nationwide furor over race and justice. Neighborhood crime-watch captain George Zimmerman claimed self-defense and has not been arrested, though state and federal authorities are still investigating. Since the slaying, a portrait has emerged of Martin as a laid-back young man who loved sports, was extremely close to his father, liked to crack jokes with friends and, according to a lawyer for his family, had never been in trouble with the law.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford, Florida</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crime watch volunteer accused of shooting an unarmed black teenager to death in this Florida town has a name suggesting that he could be of German ancestry. The truth is more complicated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 28, allegedly shot and killed 17 year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in a gated neighbourhood of Sanford, Florida on February 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman is widely described as a white man, but the one-time Catholic altar boy &quot;is Hispanic and grew up in a multiracial family&quot;, his father said in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He would be the last to discriminate for any reason whatsoever,&quot; 64 year-old Robert Zimmerman wrote. &quot;The media portrayal of George as a racist could not be further from the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman claimed he acted in self-defence after a confrontation with the teenager. He has been neither detained nor charged with any crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At The Retreat at Twin Lakes, the gated community where Martin was shot dead, few people seemed to know anything about the Zimmermans. Neighbours interviewed were unable to physically identify George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the mother is not Puerto Rican or Mexican, but she is Hispanic,&quot; a community resident said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect's mother, Gladys Zimmerman, was a court interpreter in Virginia and is of Peruvian origin, the Washington Post reported Friday, cited a former colleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former neighbours in northern Virginia, where the suspect grew #124up, described the family of three #124children as being devout Catholics, according to the Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following police advice George Zimmerman has not talked publicly about the incident, father said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Court records uncovered by US media show that Zimmerman was accused of domestic violence in 2002 and 2006, but in both cases he claimed his girlfriends at the time attacked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday Seminole State College, where Zimmerman has been taking classes since 2003, announced that it took &quot;the unusual but necessary step ... to withdraw Mr Zimmerman from enrolment&quot; due to &quot;the highly charged and high-profile controversy&quot;, the college said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This decision is based solely on our responsibility to provide for the safety of our students on campus as well as for Mr Zimmerman,&quot; Seminole State said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmermans have moved out of the gated community, at least temporarily, due to death threats, Robert Zimmerman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, was in his last year of high school in Miami, 400 kilometres south of Sanford, where he lived with his mother. The teen was in the gated Sanford community visiting his father the night of the fatal shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At no time did George follow or confront Mr Martin. When the true details of the event became public, and I hope that will be soon,&quot; the letter said, &quot;everyone should be outraged by the treatment of George Zimmerman in the media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media crush in the gated community was such that neighbours hired a uniformed security guard to control access.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Honestly, the truth is that I never saw him. I even don't know who he is,&quot; said Angel Hicks, 40, a community resident and Sanford public school teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Hicks, who is black, half of the community residents are white and the rest are African-American, Latino and Asian. &quot;I've never felt racial issues here,&quot; she said, &quot;but I think in the case of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin the racial factor played a role.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LeBron James and Dwyane Wade led the Miami Heat in sending a supportive message over a controversial killing yesterday in addition to scoring the most points in the team's NBA triumph over Detroit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wade scored 24 points and James added 17 to lead the visiting Heat over the Detroit Pistons 88-73. Miami improved to 35-11, the second-best record in the NBA, trailing only the Chicago Bulls at 39-10. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's what the team did earlier that was the bigger Twitter topic of conversation as Heat players posed for a team photo with all of them wearing hooded sweatshirt, hoodies, with heads bowed and hands in their pockets. Hoodies have become a symbol in the wake of the shooting death of an unarmed black Florida teenager wearing a hooded sweater by a white volunteer guard last February 26 near Orlando, where the NBA All-Star Game was being played.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No charges have been filed in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, which has prompted calls for a deeper investigation into the incident, which the shooter has said was an act of self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Heat hoodie picture was made public in a Twitter posting by James, an NBA superstar, and in the wake of team-mate Wade posting a Twitter picture of himself in a grey hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a powerful statement,&quot; Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the hashtags linked to the team photo James posted was one that said &quot;WeWantJustice&quot;. Another was &quot;WeAreTrayvonMartin&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our hearts go out to the family and loved ones of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin for their loss and for everyone involved in this terrible tragedy,&quot; the Heat said in a statement. &quot;We support our players and join them in hoping that their images and our logo can be part of the national dialogue and can help in our nation's healing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wade told the South Florida Sun Sentinel the message was meant to support all who grieve Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a father,&quot; Wade said. &quot;It's support of the tragic thing that has taken place. No matter what colour, race, we're all fathers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you think about what that family's going through, it hits you hard and it hurts your heart to think about it. Obviously we can't bring him back, but anything you can do to get behind and support is what we're doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Miami players reportedly wore messages written on their sneakers during the Detroit game that said, &quot;RIP Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot; and &quot;We Want Justice&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other NBA players joined the hoodie movement, including New York Knicks stars Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire, whose team saw a five-game win streak snapped with a 96-79 defeat at Toronto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stoudemire scored 17 points and Anthony added 12 and both posted pictures of themselves wearing hoodies on their Twitter pages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony posted his picture in a grey hoodie with head bowed and in front of it the words &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin!!!!!&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stoudemire wore a hoodie when he arrived at the game and in a pre-game workout and tweeted, &quot;I got my hoodie. Stand up?&quot; with hashtags to &quot;RIPTrayvonMartin&quot; and &quot;justicemustbehad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thunder overcomes Love</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the smoke settled, the Oklahoma City Thunder had won the epic shootout behind hotshots Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Westbrook poured in nine of his career-high 45 points in the second overtime, Durant added 40 with a season-high 17 rebounds and the Thunder withstood 51 points by Kevin Love to outlast the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves 149-140.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was an unbelievable game, probably the best I've ever played in,&quot; Durant said after the instant classic. &quot;It was nerve-racking, but it was fun to be a part of, something that people are going to look back and enjoy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Love set a personal-best and Minnesota franchise mark for most points scored and pulled down 14 rebounds. JJ Barea had a triple double with 25 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds but the T-Wolves lost for the fifth time in six games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would have meant a lot more if we got the win,&quot; said Love, whose tied Durant for the second highest game in the NBA this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's tough because we had chances to win the game. But Kevin, Russell and the rest of their team made plays. That's why they're the top team in the West.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durant appeared to have drained the game-winning three with 3.9 seconds left in regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Love answered with a triple of his own with one second remaining that sent the game into the first overtime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Thunder trailed by five with 46 seconds left, but Westbrook made a driving lay-up and Durant buried a cold-blooded three-pointer from the right corner with 10 seconds remaining that forced a second five-minute session knotted at 129-apiece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Westbrook, then, took charge and the Thunder closed on a 9-2 run to for their 11th straight win in the series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just tried to get aggressive,&quot; the speedy All-Star guard said. &quot;I tried to get to the basket and get us some points.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roberto Gonzalez/AP Photo/</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taimur Khan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York // Florida's controversial self-defence law has emerged at the centre of a furious national debate over the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager, and whether his confessed killer can be charged under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 'Stand Your Ground' law, as it is commonly known, was passed by the Florida legislature in 2005, the first state out of 22 that have enacted similar laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under traditional law, deadly force is only allowed by an individual if the option to retreat from a violent situation proves to be impossible. With 'Stand Your Ground', deadly force can be used if someone believes they are in danger of being killed or injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law tips the benefit of the doubt heavily in favour of people claiming self defence - especially in cases when the only other witness is dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this was what was behind the decision by the police department in Sanford, Florida not to press charges in the killing of 17-year-old Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was killed a month ago by George Zimmerman, 28, an armed neighbourhood watch volunteer who claims he shot in self defence when Martin attacked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growing evidence, however, has contradicted Mr Zimmerman's story and sparked nationwide protests via social media this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests have led to the temporary resignation of Sanford's police chief, a civil rights investigation by the federal Justice Department, and a Florida grand jury prepared to decide whether murder charges should be laid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Barack Obama, the US president, weighed in on Friday, saying that: &quot;My main message is to the parents of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. And I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, who had made 46 calls to 911 in a little over a year to report suspicious people, was recorded telling a police dispatcher that he was following a black male he had suspected of casing houses. In the call, he referred to Martin with a racial slur. At the time, Martin was walking from a convenience store, holding a can of ice tea and a packet of Skittles, to his father's fiancee's house in the rain, and was wearing a hooded sweatshirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mr Zimmerman's account to the police, he said that he approached Martin and then was attacked from behind as he tried to get back into his SUV and that he shot in self defence. But evidence appears to show that he was the aggressor. In the 911 call the dispatcher tells Mr Zimmerman not to approach Martin, an order he ignores. According to Martin's girlfriend, who was on the phone with him until the altercation, Martin told her he was being followed by a man in a truck and that he was going to walk away fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 911 calls from neighbours, a pleading high-pitched voice can be heard before two gunshots silence it. Mr Zimmerman claims the voice is his, but Martin's parents as well as witnesses say that the voice is clearly Martin's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors of the law in Florida have said that it simply &quot;empowers&quot; people to protect themselves, while critics - including local law enforcement officials - claim that it provides legal cover for vigilante justice, as well as what could be considered manslaughter or murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We opposed it during time they implemented it and we've been living with it since,&quot; said Mr William Meggs, the state attorney in Tallahassee. Florida. &quot;It was a totally unnecessary law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors have said 'Stand Your Ground' has been invoked with increasing regularity since 2005. In 2010, the Tampa Bay Times reported that in the first half of the decade there were an average of 34 justifiable homicides per year. By 2009, the average had spiked to 100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People who are using this law are not law-abiding citizens, they are gangs, thugs, drug dealers,&quot; said Mr Meggs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described how, in 2008, a daytime shoot-out by gang members killed a 15-year-old bystander. The two men charged with the murder had their cases thrown out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What this means, as illustrated by this case, is that two individuals, or even groups, can square off in the middle of a public street, exchange gunfire, and both be absolved from criminal liability if they were reasonably acting in self-defence,&quot; wrote Judge Terry Lewis at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meggs said that law has been invoked in cases, especially domestic violence cases, he considers to be justified, but he thinks that they would have been covered by pre-Stand Your Ground self-defence laws anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors and legal scholars claim the law makes it too easy to claim self defence. Before trials even begin, judges can be asked by the defence to dismiss the case under 'Stand Your Ground' and that the required standard of evidence required is much less than that needed by juries. Often, with only one side of the story, judges are forced to dismiss the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a much lower standard,&quot; added Zachary Weaver, a Florida attorney who wrote an extensive study of the law for the University of Miami Law Review in 2009. &quot;And it becomes a large factor because less cases are prosecuted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Eddins, the state attorney in Pensacola, Florida, said many of his colleagues believed the widely publicised law, even before the Martin killing, contributes to the increasing violence as people know they have an option not to retreat in confrontations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want laws sending the message that it's normal conduct to shoot someone in a road rage incident,&quot; said Garrett Epps, a scholar of constitutional law and civil rights at the University of Baltimore law school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a mainstreaming of violent behaviour that ought to trouble us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Either we can go and be Mad Max or, if we want to live in a society where people resort to violence as little as possible, this law is something that ought be looked at.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meggs said he hopes that Martin's killing instigates a review of the law in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been saying for years that its going to take the wrong person to get killed to bring attention to this law,&quot; said Mr Meggs. &quot;And that's what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For more than a decade, George Zimmerman dreamed of a life in law enforcement - but instead of becoming a real cop, he lived out his big blue fantasy by tracking down stray dogs, &quot;suspicious&quot; children and other intruders in his gated Florida community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before he gunned down unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin - an incident President Obama confronted Friday, calling it a tragedy - Zimmerman had been a nuisance to 911 operators. He would carry around with him a pistol and the hope that he would one day wear a badge.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman grew up in Manassas, Va., a Catholic altar boy who was the son of a military man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He wrote in his senior yearbook that he was &quot;going to Florida to work with my godfather who just bought a $1 million business&quot; - but Zimmerman's heart was pulling him toward law enforcement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He wanted to join the police force - either the State Police or the county police,&quot; said George Hall, 78, a retired minister and longtime neighbor of Zimmerman in Virginia.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He asked me to write him a letter of recommendation, and I was glad to. He was such a wonderful kid. I thought he'd be the kind of officer I wanted protecting me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I had no doubt about his abilities to look out for citizens. I would have an easier time respecting him than I have with some officers now.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hall said he didn't know when Zimmerman's detective dreams were dashed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But that didn't stop Zimmerman from playing the part.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He had a license to carry a concealed weapon, and he started a neighborhood watch last September in his gated community in Sanford, Fla.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Well before that, he was calling cops for just the slightest, racially tinged suspicions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the watch volunteer at the 260-unit Retreat at Twin Lakes, he became a paranoid pest - peppering 911 with at least 46 calls. They varied in urgency, but in the last year focused mostly on black men or boys. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That included a &quot;suspicious&quot; &shy;7- to 9-year-old boy with a &quot;skinny build&quot; and short black hair. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   In November 2006, he called to report a red Toyota pickup truck &quot;driving real slow&quot; around the neighborhood for five minutes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In September 2009, he called about a &quot;yellow speed bike&quot; weaving in and out of traffic and doing &quot;wheelies.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A month later, Zimmerman was hot on the scent of an &quot;aggressive white and brown pit bull.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And last August, he reported a black man he believed was &shy;&quot;involved in recent&quot; burglaries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The son of a white father and a Peruvian mother, Zimmerman was ambitious, friends said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman moved to Florida in 2001, and he enrolled in Seminole State College in 2003, pursuing a vocational certificate to become an insurance agent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Down South, he had his own brushes with the law. In 2005, he was arrested for assaulting a cop and resisting arrest. He avoided conviction by entering a pretrial-diversion program.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That same year, his ex-fianc&eacute;e, Veronica Zuazo, filed a restraining order against him, claiming he had been near her home &quot;just checking up&quot; on her. When she demanded that he leave, he allegedly grew violent, pushing her, according to the Miami Herald.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The next day, he filed his own petition and claimed she wanted him to stay the night and grew &shy;violent when he refused. A judge ordered both to stay away from each other.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2008, he explained away his arrest on an enrollment application to a citizen's law-enforcement academy program at the Seminole County Sheriff's Office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I was in an altercation with an undercover officer that was taking part in an ATF sting for &shy;underage drinking in UCF [University of Central Florida],&quot; Zimmerman wrote, according to documents obtained by The Post.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He never told me he was an &shy;officer and assaulted me first. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;My father is a retired magistrate judge for the Supreme Court of Virginia and my mother was a deputy clerk of court for over 20 years,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I hold law-enforcement officers in the highest regard as I hope one day to become one.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman was accepted into the 14-week course, which offers civilians an inside look at the sheriff's office, the courthouse and the jail. He never became a cop - he was a pencil pusher, according to the Orlando Sentinel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman re-enrolled at Seminole State in 2009 - still with the hopes of joining law enforcement - but was booted last week because of safety concerns for him, the Los Angeles Times said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman's paranoia led directly to his Feb. 26 encounter with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police said Zimmerman first spied Trayvon walking from a 7-Eleven at about 7:15 p.m. and called police to report him as suspicious. Although he was told by a 911 operator not to get involved, Zimmerman followed Trayvon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They scuffled and Zimmerman shot him once in the chest with his licensed Kel-Tec 9mm semiautomatic handgun. Zimmerman says he acted in self-defense. A special prosecutor, the FBI and the US Department of Justice are investigating. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman is also facing trouble from the militant New Black Panther Party, which yesterday offered a $10,000 reward for his &quot;capture,&quot; the Sentinel reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  George Zimmerman has placed at least 46 calls to 911 in the last eight years. In the last year, his calls focused on blacks in his gated community: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  April 22, 2011: Reports &quot;black male, 7 to 9 years old with skinny build,&quot; walking around the neighborhood. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Aug. 3, 2011: Calls in a black male he &quot;believes is involved in recent burglaries in the neighborhood.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Aug. 6, 2011: Fingers two black teens he thinks &quot;have been burglarizing homes in this area.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Oct. 1, 2011: Reports two black males, approximately 20 to 30 years old, whom he does not recognize. He says he's &quot;concerned due to recent burglaries in the area.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Feb. 2, 2012: Drops dime on a black male because it is &quot;unknown what he is doing.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Feb. 26: Calls about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;Hey, we've had some break-ins in my neighborhood, and there is a real suspicious guy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked by the dispatcher what the suspect looks like, he says:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He looks black . . . Now he's coming towards me. He's got his hand in his waistband. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An alleged eyewitness is backing the 28-year-old gunman at the center of a national firestorm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A person named &quot;John&quot; told a Fox affiliate in Orlando that he saw an altercation unfold between George Zimmerman and 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, whom he shot and killed on Feb. 26.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police said Zimmerman called 911 and described Martin as &quot;suspicious.&quot; The two scuffled, and Trayvon wound up dead from a single bullet from Zimmerman's licensed 9mm semiautomatic, authorities say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The guy on the bottom, who I believe had a red sweater on, was yelling to me, 'Help, help.' I told him to stop, I was calling 911,&quot; John told the TV station. Zimmerman was wearing red.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;When I got upstairs and looked down, the person that was on top beating up the other guy was laying in the grass. And I believe he was dead at that point,&quot; the eyewitness claimed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman has claimed he acted in self-defense, though he was the one following Trayvon. He has not been charged and has been in hiding since the shooting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trayvon's friends have said the teen was not violent and they could never imagine him getting into a fight.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman's family said race had nothing to do with the incident.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Unfortunately, some individuals and organizations have used this tragedy to further their own causes and agendas,&quot; Zimmerman's father, George, a retired judge, wrote in the Orlando Sentinel.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MAP / CHRONOLOGY / TIMELINE </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1. Around 7 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 26, TrayvonMartin, 17, walked to this 7-Eleven in Sanford, Fla., where he bought a bag of Skittles and a can of Arizona Iced Tea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2. As Martin walked home, he was spotted by &quot;night watchman&quot; George Zimmerman, 28, on patrol at the Retreat at Twin Lakes community. Zimmerman called 911 but was told not to pursue.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3. Several neighbors call police to report two males fighting. In one call, a gunshot is clearly audible. Police arrive minutes before 7:30 p.m., and Sanford emergency personnel pronounce Trayvon dead at the scene (below).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 25--The fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by a Florida block watch volunteer has captured the nation's attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooter, George Zimmerman, has not been charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason people are riveted to the story is that many people recognize that it could have happened anywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if it had happened in Connecticut, Zimmerman, 28 -- who told police he acted in self-defense as Martin, 17, walked through his suburban Orlando condominium complex wearing a hoodie -- would likely have been arrested, state officials say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's because Connecticut law differs from Florida law in a fundamental way, said Michael Lawlor, a former East Haven state legislator who is now Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's undersecretary for criminal justice policy and planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Connecticut law, when you're outside your own home or place of business, you can only use deadly force &quot;if you reasonably believe that you or someone else are in ... danger of death&quot; or serious injury, said Lawlor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before using deadly force, you have a duty to retreat if you can do so with complete safety,&quot; said Lawlor, a lawyer and former state prosecutor who taught criminal justice at the University of New Haven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means that &quot;if someone is coming at you and you have a gun, you can't stand your ground and wait for them to come to you,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to retreat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those restrictions don't apply if you're inside your home or place of business, or if you're a police officer, Lawlor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida is among 21 states with a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which gives people wide latitude to use deadly force rather than retreat during a fight. The Florida law lets police officers on the scene decide whether they believe the self-defense claim. In many cases, the officer's defer to making the arrest, letting the courts work out whether the deadly force was justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this case, police have said they are confident they did the right thing by not charging 28-year-old Zimmerman, a white Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told police he was attacked by Martin after he had given up chasing the boy and he was returning to his truck. He had a bloody nose and blood on the back of his head, according to police. Martin's family questions Zimmerman's story, and believes if their races were reversed, there is no doubt a black shooter would be jailed, even if he claimed self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are making it look like Zimmerman is the victim and their son is in the grave,&quot; said Benjamin Crump, attorney for Martin's parents. &quot;It's about equal justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the National Rifle Association-backed Florida law passed in 2005, Florida, unlike most other states, grants immunity from prosecution or arrest to suspects who successfully invoke the &quot;stand your ground&quot; claim. And if a suspect is arrested and charged, a judge can throw out the case well before trial based on a self-defense claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here, it's a little different,&quot; said state Rep. Stephen D. Dargan, D-West Haven, longtime House chairman of the General Assembly's Public Safety Committee. In Connecticut, &quot;you might need to justify the use of deadly force,&quot; Dargan said. &quot;It's not like the wild, wild West here. ... The law enforcement and probably the court system might look at it a little differently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Zimmerman or someone like him did a similar thing here, &quot;he would definitely be in deep trouble,&quot; said state Sen. Tony Guglielmo, R-Stafford, the ranking senate member of the Public Safety Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this state, &quot;you basically can't do anything outside your own home, and my understanding is, you can't use excessive force,&quot; Guglielmo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless there's something more to the story, it seems incredible that he would shoot someone,&quot; he said of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's attorney, Craig Sonner, said Saturday that his client has been unfairly portrayed as a racist. He said he's spoken with several of Zimmerman's friends, including some who are black, and &quot;they only have good things to say about him,&quot; Sonner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is George a racist? The answer is no, absolutely not,&quot; Sonner said. &quot;The incident that transpired is not racially motivated or a hate crime in any way. It was self-defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonner said that if charges are brought against his client, Zimmerman would be willing to turn himself in to police. &quot;We will follow the law,&quot; Sonner said. &quot;I believe what the evidence will show is that this case does fall under (the stand your ground law),&quot; Sonner said. &quot;I believe we have a good case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonner would not say where Zimmerman was, following multiple death threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After simmering for weeks, the story has sizzled in recent days -- with President Obama jumping into the fray Friday, urging Americans to &quot;do some soul searching&quot; and declaring, 'If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can only imagine what these parents are going through, and when I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,'' Obama said at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said the parents of Martin have a right to expect ''that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, thanked Obama for his support, saying in a statement that the president's words ''touched us deeply and made us wonder: If his son looked like Trayvon and wore a hoodie, would he be suspicious, too?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case resonates with many black Americans, a key voting group during Obama's 2008 election, who see it as an example of bias toward blacks. Civil rights groups have held rallies in Florida and New York, and in Washington, D.C., and Chicago Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of Sanford's 53,000 residents, 57 percent are white and 30 percent are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the public outcry, the Sanford police chief and state's attorney in the case have both stepped aside.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stan Allen, a Westside Neighborhood Watch volunteer in Daytona Beach, saw a house on Oakwood Drive that seemed problematic. He saw needles and other trash in the yard, &quot;things that looked wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did what neighborhood watch volunteers are supposed to do. He called police and told them what he saw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tip led to the arrest of Lynell Tucker, a man wanted for murder in Delaware. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly a month after a neighborhood watch volunteer told police he shot and killed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Sanford as an act of self-defense, those involved in some 200 watch groups in Volusia and Flagler counties are revisiting their role in the criminal justice system. They are additional eyes and ears for law enforcement, nothing more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they say the actions of the watchman, George Zimmerman, as heard on 9-1-1 tapes, are a good example of what not to do, and why not to do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He never should have made contact,&quot; said Allen, a 53-year-old husband and father. &quot;He called police. They told him they were responding. That was all they needed for him to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighborhood watch groups vary on their level of training, their approach to patrols and the areas they are attempting to protect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allen, for instance, lives in an urban area. Lt. Jack Waples, public information officer for the DeLand police, lives in a rural area and -- along with his neighbors -- looks out for anything unusual at the homes and with the livestock nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to working in concert with less-structured neighborhood watch groups, the Volusia County Sheriff's Office has formally trained COP volunteers, people in the Citizens Observer Program who wear uniforms and drive sheriff's vehicles but don't carry weapons or make arrests. In Flagler County, some 40 groups mostly in the Palm Coast area have brought neighbors together and educated more people about crimes such as identity theft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighborhood watch is a very valuable asset,&quot; Volusia Sheriff Ben Johnson said. &quot;The vigilante thing . . . we've never had that kind of a problem here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some volunteers are in their 80s. Others are 19 or 20, said Tim Lamprey, the Volusia sheriff's COP coordinator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All COPs go through a background check and a screening process, Lamprey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes, younger volunteers have ideas about becoming police officers and think joining the COPs might be a way to improve their chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're called in, usually for a sit-down meeting that lasts 45 minutes,&quot; Lamprey said. &quot;I explain to them: 'This is not law enforcement.' They can't get involved in investigations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not all neighborhood watch groups are as structured. All policing agencies can do with nonsanctioned groups is offer tips and suggestions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The (Volusia) Sheriff's Office doesn't promote organized neighborhood watch patrols, and we discourage our neighborhood watch members from making investigative contacts,&quot; sheriff's spokesman Gary Davidson wrote in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Sanford shooting has raised many questions in the public about who neighborhood watch members are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are not police wannabes,&quot; said Frank Heckman, organizer of the Beachside Neighborhood Watch group in Daytona Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 25 years of the Beachside group, Heckman said he has had more than 2,000 volunteers, and only once has he removed a person for breaking the rules and carrying a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actions of Zimmerman on Feb. 26 are being discussed as a &quot;good example of what can happen when you are doing something you aren't supposed to,&quot; Heckman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Sylvia, who coordinates a neighborhood watch group on the southwest side of DeLand, said he was saddened by Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 17-year-old boy was returning to his father's Sanford home from a convenience store carrying only a bag of Skittles and a can of iced tea. Zimmerman is heard on 9-1-1 tapes describing the boy as &quot;suspicious.&quot; When a dispatcher told Zimmerman police were on the way and he didn't need to follow Martin, Zimmerman continued anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Zimmerman) did everything he was not supposed to,&quot; Sylvia said. &quot;It was a total lack of respect for law enforcement and you just don't do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sylvia's group doesn't even do patrols, but has been effective in reducing crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of break-ins has gone from an average of 13 or 14 a week to one or two every four or five months, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DeLand has changed a lot since Sylvia -- a U.S. Air Force retiree -- was born there in 1931.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People have moved from the front yard to the backyard for privacy,&quot; he said. &quot;That allows anything and everything to go on up and down the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starting the program has brought the neighborhood closer. People now know one another and look out for each other's properties, he said. The volunteers have met with DeLand police, he said, and established a better rapport, leading to faster response times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEVELOPMENTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATTORNEY DEFENDS ACTIONS: Craig Sonner, an attorney representing George Zimmerman, says he believes the state's stand-your-ground law applies to the case. He said Zimmerman has been unfairly portrayed as a racist and acted in self-defense when he shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHIEF THREATENED: The Seminole County Sheriff's Office says John Carnduff Stewart of Melbourne Beach was charged after emailing Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee on Friday, saying Lee and his family should be killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B-CU MARCHES FOR MARTIN: Students at Bethune-Cookman University sent out a campuswide notice on Friday of a March for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on Monday at 4:30 p.m. from the university quad to First Baptist Church of Daytona Beach.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Gov. Jeb Bush had this to say seven years ago when he signed a sweeping new Florida gun law:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's common sense to allow people to defend themselves. When you're in a position where you're being threatened ... to have to retreat and put yourself in a very precarious position defies common sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who could be against common sense? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That common sense manifested itself in Sanford last month in the death of Trayvon Martin, 17, who made the fatal mistake of walking through a gated community while appearing to be &quot;up to no good,&quot; according to an armed and zealous community-watch volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Common sense told George Zimmerman, 28, that the black teenager was trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got his hand in his waistband, and he's a black male,&quot; Zimmerman told the police dispatcher as he monitored Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yup, he's got something in his hand, and I don't know what the deal is,&quot; Zimmerman told the dispatcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Common sense told Zimmerman that he was justified in being alarmed by a black teenager holding something in his hand and &quot;looking at all the houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Martin had a bag of Skittles and an Arizona iced tea in his hand didn't make common sense to Zimmerman. Or that the boy was there not to burglarize the neighborhood, but because he was walking back to his father's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's common sense led him to tell the 911 dispatcher that &quot;these ***holes always get away.&quot; And he wasn't going to allow it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So even though the neighborhood in question was suggestively named The Retreat at Twin Lakes, Zimmerman felt no obligation to abandon his pursuit of the teenager, even after a dispatcher told him, &quot;We don't need you to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when that surveillance led to a confrontation between Zimmerman and the unarmed teenager, and the boy was shot and killed, that common-sense &quot;stand your ground&quot; law was able to guide the Sanford Police Department in not charging Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Especially after Zimmerman explained that he killed the teenager because he was afraid for his own safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As that common-sense law says: If a person is attacked in &quot;any place where he or she has a right to be,&quot; there's no duty to retreat, but instead there's a right to &quot;stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force&quot; if necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So common sense told Sanford police that this was justifiable homicide. Case closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing more would have come from all this common sense if Martin's family and friends hadn't screamed bloody murder to a nation that heard their cries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford's handling of the case will be reviewed by state and federal authorities. Sanford's police chief temporarily resigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Florida, that bastion of common sense, looks bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So bad that even the NRA-enamored Gov. Rick Scott has taken time out from his urine-farming initiatives to call for further investigation of the stand-your-ground shooting law that has kept Zimmerman a free man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess it makes common sense for Florida lawmakers to run for cover now that it's clear they've been cheerleading a law that gives legal cover to untrained lethal hotheads who use racial stereotyping to guide their own common sense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By ANA M. VALDES Palm Beach Post Staff Writer</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SECTION; Pg. 1A</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As details keep trickling in about the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Edith Bush can't help but think back to her childhood in the Deep South, where segregation and racial discourse were a part of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush, a West Palm Beach-based civil rights activist, said learning that Martin was shot by a 28-year-old white man who is claiming self-defense under Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law mirrors the Ku Klux Klan storming through her segregated Alabama hometown. Martin, a black 17-year-old from Miami, was unarmed when he was killed Feb. 26 in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This to me is just legalized lynching. It's wide open, almost like an uncovered Ku Klux Klan,&quot; Bush said, adding that George Zimmerman, the crime watch volunteer who shot Martin, would probably be in jail facing murder charges had he been black. Zimmerman has not been charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know that if it had been the other way around, that the young man had been white and the shooter had been black, the stand-up law would not have been applied. They would not have even had mentioned it,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush's outrage over Martin's death echoes the sentiments of many in Palm Beach County's black community, and across the nation, who say the incident is an example of a constant battle against racial profiling and discrimination decades after the civil rights movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama, the nation's first black president, also weighed in Friday for the first time about Martin's death. In a message to Martin's parents, Obama said, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans take this with the seriousness that it deserves, and we're going to get to the bottom of what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multicultural society</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But activists in Palm Beach County's Hispanic community say it's also an example of the ongoing struggle among minorities to accept each other. Zimmerman's mother is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's always going to be an issue in our country because we are a multicultural society,&quot; said Aileen Josephs, a West Palm Beach immigration attorney born in Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that community leaders should work toward uniting minorities &quot;so when we see a black youth in the street, we don't assume he's a criminal and when we see a Latino, we don't automatically assume he's undocumented and ask for a green card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police, Martin was on his way back to his family's home in a gated community Feb. 26 after buying Skittles and a can of iced tea at a nearby convenience story. Zimmerman saw Martin, who was wearing a hooded jacket, and called police because he was suspicious of the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 911 call between Zimmerman and police reveals Zimmerman followed Martin against the dispatcher's advice. When police arrived, they found Martin facedown, lifeless. Zimmerman, who was bleeding, said he shot the teenager in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who know Zimmerman say he is not a racist. High school friends have described him as a good guy, and neighbors in Sanford said he was passionate about the community's safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's family has said he's sensitive to minorities. They have pointed out several times that he is half Hispanic, and in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Zimmerman's father described his son as a &quot;Spanish-speaking minority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cultural tensions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manuel Guerra Casas, a Mexican immigrant from Indiantown, said the case has revealed the cultural tensions that sometimes exist between Hispanics and blacks, which can lead to derogatory remarks and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It makes me very sad to think that we as Hispanics in the United States have these prejudices against our black brothers,&quot; he said. &quot;It's very sad to see that we place these labels and think of blacks a certain way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond racial tensions, the stand-your-ground law allows people like Zimmerman to take actions with deadly consequences, said Addie Greene, a Mangonia Park councilwoman and former Palm Beach County commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you passed that law, you gave people the ability to be bounty hunters,&quot; Greene said. &quot;It's created bounty hunters on our young boys, black or white.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most of the time, Greene said, it's the black community that has to be most wary about these laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are creating a situation that will bring back racial tensions and set us back 100 years,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greene, Bush and dozens of other black community leaders will board a bus Monday morning in West Palm Beach to attend the Justice Rally for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Sanford that afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAACP to rally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Florida chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People are planning another rally Saturday at the Sanford courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greene said that hearing recordings of Zimmerman's conversation with police dispatchers the night Martin was killed leaves no doubt in her mind that the crime watch volunteer was on a mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I listen to it over and over and over again on CNN and the tapes, and if I close my eyes and don't know what color that child is, the tone of the voice of this man with the gun, it was like he was out looking for someone,&quot; Greene said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To me, this guy would have shot him no matter what color he was,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Martin's death reminded her of the death of Jerrod Miller, a 16-year-old black boy who was shot and killed in 2005 by a rookie Delray Beach police officer after the unlicensed teen drove his car into the Delray Full Service Center campus during a school dance. The officer, Darren Cogoni, was cleared by a grand jury, then fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury's decision enraged Miller's relatives and local black leaders, who said they thought race played a role in the decision to clear the white officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush said the deaths of teenagers like Martin and Miller scare black parents, who find themselves talking to their teenagers about ways to stay safe while following the law and respecting authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2011 State of America's Children report by the Children's Defense Fund showed that in 2007, black males ages 15-19 were more than five times as likely as white males and more than twice as likely as Hispanic males to be killed by a firearm. The study also showed that between 1979 and 2007, firearm deaths of black children and teens increased by 61 percent, while the deaths of white children and teens decreased by about 54 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You say to them, 'Make sure you respect the law, respect people,' and other people don't have to tell their children that,&quot; Bush said. &quot;People are just mad, because you just don't do things like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pending the outcome of some voice analysis, there is arguably enough evidence in the 911 tapes to warrant the arrest of George Zimmerman in connection with the Feb. 26 shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. The voice testing is needed to determine if Zimmerman uttered a racial slur while in pursuit of Martin, and which of the two can be heard crying out for help during their altercation in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are seven observations about Zimmerman's 911 call to police, and one point about the neighbors' calls: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, Zimmerman began his call by saying, &quot;We've had some break-ins in my neighborhood.&quot; I'd like to know if that is true. And it strikes me as peculiar that he did not identify himself immediately. The Orlando Sentinel reports that, in the last 15 months, Zimmerman had called the Sanford police 46 times. So why not begin this latest call by saying, &quot;Hey, it's me, George Zimmerman, from the neighborhood watch?&quot; Wouldn't a neighborhood watch volunteer want the police to know who he was? If not, why not?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, he never offered anything concrete to justify a request for police assistance. He first told the police operator that the teen he was watching is &quot;a real suspicious guy.&quot; Then he said he &quot;looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs, or something.&quot; Well, what exactly was it about Martin that raised Zimmerman's suspicions? &quot;It's raining and he's just walking around, looking about,&quot; he said. But walking in the rain with your eyes open isn't by itself nefarious. Maybe that's why Zimmerman then took it up a notch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, having offered a litany of nonspecific concerns, Zimmerman calmly tried to portray Martin as an aggressor: &quot;He's just staring, looking at all the houses. Now just staring at me.&quot; That was followed by: &quot;Now he's coming toward me.&quot; Then, the more menacing: &quot;He's got his hand in his waist band.&quot; Finally: &quot;Something's wrong with him. Yup, he's coming to check me out. He's got something in his hands, I don't know what his deal is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth, Zimmerman seeks a form of complicity from the operator that was not reciprocated. He mutters, &quot;These a-, they always get away.&quot; To his credit, the operator did not react. Instead, he continued to solicit locational information from Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifth, Zimmerman seems to make a racist statement. After he reports that &quot;he's running,&quot; the door to his truck can be heard opening. If Martin were running, that is hardly the behavior of a confrontational individual against whom deadly force need be used. And the blogosphere is on fire with conjecture that Zimmerman called Martin a &quot;coon.&quot; I raised the audio of that part of the tape, and it sure sounds like he said that. If it's confirmed, that statement alone should provide sufficient probable cause to indict Zimmerman for a hate crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixth, Zimmerman ignores the operator's advice. After he departs from his truck to pursue Martin, Zimmerman's breathing is audibly labored. The operator hears that, and asks, &quot;Are you following him?&quot; Zimmerman replies, &quot;Yep.&quot; The operator responds: &quot;We don't need you to do that.&quot; This would seemingly have been another natural opportunity for Zimmerman to say, &quot;I'm a neighborhood watch volunteer.&quot; Instead, he softly says, &quot;OK.&quot; Then, the continued sound of his breathing suggests he was still pursuing Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventh, Zimmerman was willing to report his name and phone number, but strangely stopped short when asked for his address. Asked if he lived in the area, he again said nothing of his neighborhood watch role. He gave part of his address, and then stopped. He said, &quot;Oh, crap, I don't want to give it out loud, I don't know where this kid is at.&quot; Instead, he tells the operator to have the police who arrive on the scene to &quot;call me and I'll tell them where I'm at.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are the calls from neighbors who heard the ensuing altercation. Florida law provides that there is no duty to retreat so long as the person using deadly force &quot;reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself.&quot; On at least one of the 911 calls logged by neighbors, a man is heard crying in distress just before the fatal gunshot is audible. Who was it, Zimmerman or Martin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a voice analysis shows it to be Zimmerman, that will suggest he was justified in using deadly force, that he was crying for help and restraining himself before drawing his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If, however, it is Martin crying out for help, Zimmerman's ability to cloak himself in &quot;stand your ground&quot; will evaporate, and that identification will appropriately lead to his arrest. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 25--Black women from the grass roots to the highest branches of Virginia government gathered in a high school auditorium to honor the sisters whose shoulders have provided a boost to them and the Richmond community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Celebrating African-American Women Achievers,&quot; the ninth annual Heritage Celebration, was a living-history lesson, a forum for contemporary issues and a cultural feast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Honored Saturday at Franklin Military Academy in Richmond's East End were retired Richmond schools Superintendent Lucille M. Brown; Richmond City Council Vice President Ellen F. Robertson; Church Hill civic leader Mary Thompson; Angela Patton, whose Camp Diva seeks to empower at-risk African-American girls; and Grace E. Harris, a retired Virginia Commonwealth University provost and vice president who twice served as acting president of the school that once denied her admission because of her race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are phenomenal. They have gone beyond the call of duty,&quot; said Del. Delores L. McQuinn, D-Richmond, who hosted the event with Councilwoman Cynthia I. Newbille.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The five honorees this afternoon, these are tremendous shoulders to stand on,&quot; Newbille said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The afternoon featured an array of cultural events, from African drums and dance to the spoken word to a theatrical production by Theatre IV. That play, &quot;The Oliver Hill Story,&quot; is based on the meeting of the civil rights lawyer and young Barbara Johns of Prince Edward County, who led more than 400 students at all-black Moton High School in the 1951 strike that resulted in a lawsuit that became part of the Supreme Court decision striking down the doctrine of &quot;separate but equal&quot; education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event's keynote speaker was Sulayman Clark, a university administrator and consultant whose historical novel &quot;The Rains&quot; is based on hundreds of scrapbooks discovered at Cheyney (Pa.) University containing newspaper clippings between 1850 and 1910.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The creator of the scrapbooks, Philadelphian William H. Dorsey, was part of a group of African-Americans who shared a sense of responsibility for preserving black history and achievement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was more than a hobby to these people. It was a sacred mission,&quot; Clark said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Clark, given the past-as-prologue undercurrent, ended his talk on a contemporary note. He said he had woken up in the middle of the night thinking of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot to death by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., while walking from a convenience store with snacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a heartbreaking story,&quot; Clark said. &quot;We can't bring Trayvon back. We know that. But history will record ... that just about a month has passed, and there's been no arrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called the episode &quot;a teachable moment&quot; and said Martin's death cannot be in vain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is history in the making,&quot; he said, &quot;and Lord knows, it can't end where it is now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By DAN K. THOMASSON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- A new Florida law seems to have legalized vigilantism, the use of deadly force by untrained civilians on the flimsiest grounds and a lack of responsibility for the mayhem that ensues. The results are predictable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A neighborhood watch volunteer shot down an unarmed 17-year-old black teenager whom he found &quot;suspiciously&quot; walking down the street in a gated community. The confrontation is having disastrous ramifications nationwide as outrage builds beyond race, color or creed. The shooter, a wannabe cop, has not been arrested by the Sanford, Fla., authorities who cite a new law on self defense that permits a person &quot;to stand his ground&quot; if he feels his life is in danger wherever he may be, not just at home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, people no longer have to avoid danger nor show evidence that they are in jeopardy. From now on, at least in Florida and other states adopting similar measures pushed by the national gun lobby, one needn't have to drag a perceived intruder off the front porch and into the front room after blowing him away. This adds a whole new peril to door-to-door selling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The volunteer is now being investigated by the FBI under the federal hate crime statute after pumping a shot into the chest of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin who reportedly was on his way back from a convenience store during a break from watching basketball on television. The gun wielder is a criminal justice student who claims that the teenager attacked him. With what? A can of iced tea and a bag of Skittles, which was all police found on him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooter, George Zimmerman, called 911 and chose to ignore warnings by the dispatcher not to follow the youth or take further action and definitely to stay in the car and wait for police who were on their way. It was the 45th time the shooter had called 911 during his volunteering career, a number that suggests a zealousness that must put anyone who happened to be on the street in danger when he is on &quot;duty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extremely worrisome nature of this incident is what it says about unrestricted carrying of firearms by those who are untrained in law enforcement but nevertheless assume responsibilities better left to police. It is a disaster in the making. Perhaps he would have stayed in the car had he not been armed. Those of us who have served on neighborhood watch patrols understand that the job is to spot possible trouble and call police, nothing more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, Florida and other states following the legislative prescription of the National Rifle Association are finding that the expanded law of self-defense is producing a nightmare of justification for crime. Authorities have found themselves handcuffed by criminals of all stripes who use the law to eliminate one another in &quot;it was either him or me&quot; defenses. Could not the good lawmakers of Florida have foreseen this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From all current accounts, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a nice young man who was a well-liked high school athlete. He certainly didn't deserve to die on an errand to a convenience store. It may be difficult for the federal investigators or a state grand jury to indict Zimmerman as mounting protests demand. But it is unsettling to know that even in one state, a self-styled lawman can shoot down an utterly unarmed person and claim self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever transpires in this matter, one thing is definite: This is a bad law. Under the axiom that something good usually comes out of something bad, this tragedy may awaken us to the need to overturn such flawed policy. That possibility isn't much solace for the family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, but it is something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, given the callous disregard for justice and public safety being shown by legislatures cowed by the NRA and other factions driving the firearms insanity, the chances are good this ultimately will be just another so-what incident in a society dedicated to pulling the trigger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence seems to show the youth was obviously frightened at being chased by a civilian car. He was on the phone with his girlfriend, walking fast and describing his predicament when she heard sounds of an altercation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 25--Thirty-nine yeas, zero nays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hard to believe that such a flawed law got unanimous support, but it did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the so-called &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; bill went to a vote in the Florida Senate seven years ago today, the final tally was 39-0. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few weeks later, there was token Democratic opposition in the House as the bill passed 92-to-20. In late April 2005, Gov. Jeb Bush signed it. In October 2005, Stand Your Ground became state law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that law is at the heart of a national debate, and international outrage, after the shooting death of unarmed Miami teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in Sanford last month. Zimmerman told police he was injured in a fight and acted in self-defense. With conflicting witnesses and unclear evidence, he has not been arrested. That's what the law spells out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a clear conscience,&quot; said former state Sen. Steve Geller, a Broward Democrat. &quot;I tried to take the bad parts out, but my amendment was defeated. I sounded warnings about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why did he and the entire South Florida Senate delegation (except for absent Fort Lauderdale Democrat Mandy Dawson) end up voting yes? Geller said it was going to pass anyway in the face of powerful National Rifle Association support, and he was afraid a no vote would be used against him in later campaigns, since the bill included reasonable parts protecting police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would have been like voting against apple pie or motherhood,&quot; Geller told me last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How's that for a profile in political courage?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law dramatically expanded self-defense parameters in Florida, allowing citizens to meet &quot;force with force&quot; in places they are legally entitled to be. If someone &quot;reasonably believes&quot; they are in &quot;imminent danger&quot; of death or serious injury, they can use deadly force and be immune from criminal prosecution or civil liability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the law, police are barred from making an arrest unless there is &quot;probable cause&quot; a killing is unjustified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Self-defense is a legal argument that you make in a courtroom to a judge and jury, not on the side of the road to police,&quot; Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Martin's family, said last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But under Stand Your Ground, some killers never have to face a judge, jury, or prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A special state prosecutor and a grand jury will soon sort out potential charges against Zimmerman. Federal officials are investigating if the shooting was racially motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fort Lauderdale attorney Gary Farmer said Stand Your Ground's encroachment on judicial territory might make the law unconstitutional. &quot;We've been waiting for a good test case,&quot; said Farmer. &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin might be it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some politicians, like Jeb Bush, are standing their ground over Stand Your Ground, saying the law shouldn't apply in the Martin case. Some say there's nothing wrong with the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But seven years after the Senate's 39-0 vote, with anger and protests over Martin's death intensifying, the feeling is no longer unanimous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 25--Somewhere over the past few decades, the model of the sports hero shrank. It didn't start with Tiger Woods' refusal to say something -- anything -- about the lack of black members at certain country clubs or of women at Augusta National.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It didn't start with Michael Jordan's avoiding political conversations because, as the namesake of the Air Jordan sneaker famously said, &quot;Republicans buy shoes too.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a cultural slide we've all participated in -- athletes, media and fans -- of expecting players only to play great and never to think great like Arthur Ashe, prod great like Muhammad Ali, talk great like Billie Jean King or Martina Navratilova, or challenge in a great way like Jim Brown or Oscar Robertson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somewhere we just stopped thinking the great athlete stood for anything that might put his image at risk. That's why it's so surprising and refreshing the Heat players stood for a team picture, heads bowed, hoodies on, to offer an Everyman look and push for an investigation into the tragedy of Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photo was as understated as the message was powerful. Thirteen famous black men, their faces in various degrees of concealment, suggest any one of them could have looked like the 17-year-old Martin when he was killed last month by a neighborhood watch activist near Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you think about what that family's going through, it hits you hard and hurts your heart,&quot; Dwyane Wade said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;#WeAreTrayvonMartin #Hoodies #Stereotyped and #WeWantJustice,&quot; LeBron James tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was a voice neither James nor Wade had used in public. No one even knew they had this side to them. Why? Because we're all so conditioned to players' filtering every decision through money or controversy that we stopped asking for such voices at some point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could this be an added bonus of the on-court partnership between Wade and James? Has their friendship emboldened their off-court voices?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did the two players on this team with the most to risk in any public statement confirm it was time to test their credible voices for something beyond pitching shoes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or maybe this was just the natural step of maturity and an issue each felt passionate enough about to assert his social conscience. Certainly after eight years on the NBA stage, as grown men with growing children, Wade and James felt this issue of racial profiling and its tragic consequence hit home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the Heat did. Martin was a Miami kid visiting his father. He grew up in a neighborhood adjacent to the ones Udonis Haslem and James Jones did. He was just younger than rookie Norris Cole and just older than Juwan Howard's son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NBA's big fear is its typical fan -- suburban and white -- will disconnect from the typical NBA player -- urban and black. And there are those who want their athletes to exist for them in a bubble world of sports, never wondering whether watching LeBron dribble is our version of watching Nero fiddle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this was the perfect issue, and they were the proper people to illuminate for their fans and, beyond that, the larger society. They had something to say and knowledge to say it, and they found the right voice in which to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once upon a time, sports was full of athletes using their voices for good. In recent generations, sports has become a social dialogue often because of the issues it regurgitates more than anything its stars say. Money. Performance-enhancing drugs. Broken trust, as in Penn State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wanted Michael Jordan to stand for more then shoes. We wanted Tiger Woods to stand for more than himself. They just didn't have it in them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Heat, as a team, took perhaps the first team picture that serves as a social statement. The system may be failing Martin. But the Heat didn't fail him. They made everyone take notice and, in so doing, showed how sports can still be on its best days.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US PRESIDENT Barack Obama has heightened the national outcry over the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager, saying it is ``imperative'' a thorough investigation is carried out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Orlando, Florida, has sparked rallies across the US because the shooter, Neighbourhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman, claims he acted in self-defence and, as a result has not been charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I can only imagine what these parents are going through,'' Mr Obama said. ``When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His controversial comments will leave him open to claims he is fuelling simmering racial tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the White House, Mr Obama said: ``I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative to investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pulls together - federal, state and local - to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police did not arrest Mr Zimmerman after he shot hoodie-wearing Trayvon on February 26. He was returning from a trip to a convenience store when Mr Zimmerman started following him, telling police dispatchers he looked suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At some point, the two got into a row and Zimmerman pulled out his gun and shot the teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's name and photo - in football jerseys, smiling alongside a baby, and staring into the camera in a gray hooded sweatshirt - have been held up by civil rights leaders and at rallies stretching from Miami to New York, demanding Zimmerman's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama spoke just a day after the leading investigators in the case stepped down following mounting criticism on how they handled the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I think all of us have to do some soul searching to figure out how does something like this happen,'' Mr Obama said. ``And that means we examine the laws, the context for what happened, as well as the specifics of the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``But my main message is to the parents of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon and I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves and that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department and FBI have opened a civil rights investigation and a grand jury is considering whether to charge Zimmerman, who acknowledged shooting the teen but said it was self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader Al Sharpton has demanded Zimmerman's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We cannot allow a precedent when a man can just kill one of us and then walk out with the murder weapon,'' he said. ``We don't want good enough. We want George Zimmerman in court with handcuffs behind his back.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally came the same day that bitterly criticised police chief Bill Lee stepped down temporarily to help quell the rising tensions surrounding the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students across Miami high schools, where Trayvon lived, held mass walk- outs this afternoon seeking justice for the murdered classmate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students at Krop, where Trayvon attended school, decided to stay on campus to honour a request from Trayvon's mother. Students plan to write letters to the family instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``There's no way I can believe that Trayvon would have done anything wrong because he's not a confrontational kid,'' said family friend Jerome Horton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``That's just not that kid. There's more to this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Horton said Trayvon loved sports, was extremely close to his father, liked to crack jokes with friends and had never been in trouble with the law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to 20,000 people demanding justice rallied late Thursday in the Florida town of Sanford, where Martin was killed by George Zimmerman late last month.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I think all of us have to do some soul-searching to figure out how does something like this happen. And that means that we examine the laws and the context for what happened,'' said Mr Obama.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I ATTENDED a rally and march in Manhattan's Union Square on Wednesday evening with thousands of people. We wore hooded jackets and held signs bearing photos of a black teenager called Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was just 17 years old when he was shot dead on February 26 in Florida by 28-year-old George Zimmerman, an overzealous neighbourhood-watch volunteer of white and Latino heritage. Almost a month later, he has yet to be arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a rainy Sunday evening and the high school pupil, wearing a hoodie to shield his head, was walking back from a supermarket when Zimmerman, who was patrolling the area, spotted him and called 911 to report &quot;a real suspicious guy&quot;. He then followed Martin - against the 911 dispatcher's orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, who was on the phone with his girlfriend, noticed the man following him and tried to lose him, but the man caught up with him and asked him what he was doing there. Minutes later the boy, who had attended classes at an aviation school and had dreams of becoming an aeroplane mechanic, lay dead. His killer pleaded self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman is free today because he is protected by Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which gives Floridians the right to use deadly force if they fear their lives are threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Million Hoodie March, Martin's mother reminded us that &quot;our son is your son&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, he is, and that is why I went to Union Square. I have friends here raising young black men who run the risk of being randomly killed by a nervous white person, or being the victims of the New York Police Department's controversial &quot;stop-and-frisk&quot; policy. Their crimes would be &quot;walking while black&quot; and &quot;looking suspicious&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas the whole country was talking about this case, black and white alike, the four Republican candidates who want to be the next US president had nothing to say about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois on Tuesday, during the primary where Mitt Romney clobbered Rick Santorum, would have been the perfect place for the candidates to voice their disapproval of what had happened in Florida. It is, after all, the political home of the Grand Old Party's Abraham Lincoln, who abolished slavery. And let us not forget: President Barack Obama, a black man who has endured prejudice from some of the candidates, had been a senator in Illinois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At election time you want to address issues that concern the people you hope to one day lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they head to the polls on November 6, minorities - the blacks and Hispanics who are the primary targets of racial profiling - will remember the Republican candidates' deafening silence when one of their own was killed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 America The US Justice Department opened an investigation following widespread protests on Monday into the killing of an unarmed 17-year-old who was shot dead while walking home from a sweet shop in a suburb of Orlando, Florida. George Zimmerman, 28, a neighbourhood watch officer, claims he acted in self-defence when he gunned down Trayvon Martin. Under the state self-defence laws he cannot be prosecuted for murder. Witnesses, however, say they heard a boy pleading before two gunshots were fired. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's mother has argued her son was targeted because he was black. She said: &quot;My son wasn't doing anything but walking on the sidewalk.&quot; The police chief resigned on Thursday. The tragedy also prompted the state governor to call for a review of the law as it applies to self-defence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BARACK OBAMA earned both praise and criticism on Friday for his careful intervention in the case of an unarmed black youth whose killing last month sparked a bitter debate that has once again exposed the racial fault lines in American society. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old Florida high school student, was shot by George Zimmerman, a white man who had volunteered for a neighbourhood watch patrol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has inflamed African-American activists and presented Obama with a challenge that underlines how little his historic presidency has changed the suspicions and antagonism between American blacks and other ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, the 28-year-old son of a white father and a Hispanic mother, was reported yesterday to be in hiding after receiving death threats. The local police chief, who initially declined to charge Zimmerman with any crime, has &quot;temporarily&quot; stepped aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an initial reluctance to intervene, Obama struck an intensely personal note on Friday when he urged a comprehensive investigation of the circumstances of Martin's death, and added: &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the president's right-wing rivals accused him of striking a note of racial divisiveness when it was not clear why Martin was shot. Zimmerman's father has said his son is not a racist, and his lawyer claimed the volunteer acted in self-defence after being threatened by Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet support for the president emerged from a broad political spectrum, including Republicans who noted that Martin was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There really is an issue of whether if you are black in America today, if you are dressed the way you are dressed, that can make you a victim,&quot; said Ari Fleischer, former press spokesman for George W Bush. &quot;These are society's most delicate issues, and I thought the president handled it delicately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's cautious response - which came almost a month after Martin was shot on February 26 - reflected the uproar he caused in 2009 when he made an off-the-cuff remark about the arrest by a white police officer of Henry Louis Gates, a black Harvard University professor. Obama said at the time the police had acted &quot;stupidly&quot;, and was assailed for taking sides before he knew the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newt Gingrich, one of the Republican presidential hopefuls, denounced Obama for &quot;trying to turn it into a racial issue&quot;. Gingrich called the president's remarks &quot;disgraceful&quot;, and added: &quot;We should all be horrified no matter what the racial background.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 America The US Justice Department opened an investigation following widespread protests on Monday into the killing of an unarmed 17-year-old who was shot dead while walking home from a sweet shop in a suburb of Orlando, Florida. George Zimmerman, 28, a neighbourhood watch officer, claims he acted in self-defence when he gunned down Trayvon Martin. Under the state self-defence laws he cannot be prosecuted for murder. Witnesses, however, say they heard a boy pleading before two gunshots were fired. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's mother has argued her son was targeted because he was black. She said: &quot;My son wasn't doing anything but walking on the sidewalk.&quot; The police chief resigned on Thursday. The tragedy also prompted the state governor to call for a review of the law as it applies to self-defence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BARACK OBAMA earned both praise and criticism on Friday for his careful intervention in the case of an unarmed black youth whose killing last month sparked a bitter debate that has once again exposed the racial fault lines in American society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old Florida high school student, was shot by George Zimmerman, a white man who had volunteered for a neighbourhood watch patrol. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has inflamed African-American activists and presented Obama with a challenge that underlines how little his historic presidency has changed the suspicions and antagonism between American blacks and other ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, the 28-year-old son of a white father and a Hispanic mother, was yesterday reported to be in hiding after receiving death threats. The local police chief, who initially declined to charge Zimmerman with any crime, has &quot;temporarily&quot; stepped aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an initial reluctance to intervene in a case still under police review, Obama struck an intensely personal note on Friday when he urged a comprehensive investigation of the circumstances of Martin's death, and added: &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the president's right-wing rivals promptly accused him of striking a note of racial divisiveness at a time when it was not clear why Martin was shot. Zimmerman's father has insisted his son is not a racist, and his lawyer claimed the volunteer acted in self-defence after being threatened by Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet support for the president emerged from a broad political spectrum, including Republicans who noted that Martin was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There really is an issue of whether if you are black in America today, if you are dressed the way you are dressed, that can make you a victim,&quot; said Ari Fleischer, former press spokesman for George W Bush. &quot;These are society's most delicate issues, and I thought the president handled it delicately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's cautious response - which came almost a month after Martin was shot on February 26 - reflected the uproar he caused in 2009 when he made an off-the-cuff remark about the arrest by a white police officer of Henry Louis Gates, a black Harvard University professor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said at the time that the police had acted &quot;stupidly&quot;, and was widely assailed for taking sides before he knew the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think [the president] has probably gotten some better advice about how to handle those situations,&quot; noted one Republican former police officer who had criticised Obama over the Gates incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newt Gingrich, one of the Republican presidential hopefuls, denounced Obama for &quot;trying to turn it into a racial issue&quot;. Gingrich called the president's remarks &quot;disgraceful&quot;, and added: &quot;We should all be horrified no matter what the racial background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Gingrich appeared to be in a minority as investigators scrutinised Zimmerman's record as a volunteer security man and Martin emerged as a quiet youth who had never shown aggressive behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday it was claimed that Zimmerman was a zealous member of his local patrol who had called the police 46 times to report suspicious behaviour over the past eight years. He had attempted to become a policeman, and attended law enforcement classes, but appears never to have graduated as a bona fide officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day Martin died, Zimmerman called police to report a suspicious teenager who was &quot;coming to check me out&quot;, according to a transcript of the call. &quot;He's got something in his hands. I don't know what his deal is. Send officers over here,&quot; Zimmerman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin then ran away and when Zimmerman said he was following the teenager, the police dispatcher told him: &quot;We don't need you to do that.&quot; Minutes later Martin was dead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin, dressed in a &quot;hoodie&quot;, was shot dead a month ago in Florida by a 28-year-old white Hispanic neighbourhood watch volunteer who said he was acting in self- defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said in his first comments about the shooting, acknowledging the racial element in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, this is a tragedy. I can only imagine what these parents are going through. And when I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has galvanized the nation and prompted rallies protesting the failure of police to arrest the shooter, George Zimmerman, and more broadly, a pattern of racial discrimination that black leaders cite in Florida and elsewhere in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents thanked the president for his words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law allows people to use deadly force in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar laws are in effect in at least 24 states including Florida, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Calls are mounting to repeal them. Earlier last week, a Florida state senator said he was drafting new legislation to drastically change the law in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bakari Sellers, a black Democrat and gun owner, said he wanted to prevent an incident like the shooting happening in his state. &quot;I'm six-five and a black guy,&quot; he said. &quot;I just know that it could have been me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said the laws should be studied. &quot;I think all of us have to do some soul-searching . . . And that means that we examine the laws . . . as well as the specifics of the incident,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think all of us have to do some soul-searching to figureout how does something like this happen. And that means that we examine the laws and the context for what happened, as well as the specifics of the incident,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pulls together -- federal, state andlocal -- to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama, the son of a white mother from Kansas and black father from Kenya, does not comment frequently on race, a sensitive topic inthe United States, whichstill grapples with a legacy of slavery, segregation and discrimination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early in his White House tenure, Mr Obama inflamed another racially tinged incident by declaring police had &quot;acted stupidly&quot; when arresting a well-known black documentary filmmaker, Henry Louis Gates, after an altercation at his home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama later invited Mr Gates and the white police officer, Sergeant James Crowley, to the White House, where the men shared a drink in what became known as the &quot;beer summit&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sanford, Norton Bonaparte Jr, the city's manager,acknowledged that tensions between the black community and police &quot;go back many, many years&quot;. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman has not commented publicly about the shooting and his whereabouts are unknown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida court records showed Mr Zimmerman was involved in at least two previous legal incidents, including a 2005 domestic violence case with his former fiancee. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY HOWARD ALTMAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tampa Tribune</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA Word about the rally for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin didn't come from the church pulpit on a Sunday but via Facebook and Twitter on a Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no Bull Connor or biting police dogs or fire hoses spraying the peaceful crowd of hundreds as it marched down a sidewalk along Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in northwest Tampa on Saturday morning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things have changed since the 1960s, said Orlando Davis, a morning radio personality with WILD (94.1 FM), as he stood on a podium at the rallying point and addressed the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unarmed young black man was gunned down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mostly black marchers shouted the decades-old chant, &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; They demanded answers to why the white shooter, a neighborhood watch captain named George Zimmerman, had not been charged with a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis, speaking into a microphone, said that while watching CNN he heard Zimmerman's attorney say, &quot;Zimmerman was not claiming a Stand Your Ground defense. ... He said he was attacked by Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Davis spoke, some of those who gathered shouted, &quot;Lies! Lies!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And though the Feb. 26 killing in Sanford has taken on racial overtones, Davis tried to play that down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out everyone &quot;has hoodies in your closet&quot; similar to the one Martin was wearing the night he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a black issue,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not a white issue. It is a young issue. A right issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally was organized through a Facebook page for a group called &quot;Real Talk: Real Answers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It (the Facebook page) was started about a year ago by a group of friends as a way to vent about issues,&quot; said Nina Range, 31,of Tampa, who organized the rally and began spreading the word through social media Wednesday night, then with news releases to the traditional media the following day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wearing a black hoodie and dark sunglasses, Range said the Facebook forum gives members a way to talk about politics, religion and current events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watching coverage of Martin's shooting, she said she decided to do something to bring awareness of the issue to the Tampa Bay area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police estimated that between 600 and 800 people marched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many of them, Martin's killing was felt on a personal, visceral level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was a bad shooting,&quot; said Steeve A. Jocelyn, 28, of Tampa, as he marched through Al Lopez Park carrying the hoodie-clad 3-year-old son of a friend on his shoulders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jocelyn said his conclusion, based on media reports that Zimmerman shot Martin after chasing him, was the result of experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a cop,&quot; Jocelyn said, explaining he is an Air Force Reserve senior airman and member of the 927 Aerial Refueling Wing security force squadron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'Stand Your Ground' law is about defending yourself. But you have to be standing, not chasing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though it became increasingly hot as the marchers made their way from the park to the rallying point, Shirley Copeland, 59, said that she would not take off the black hoodie she was wearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't care if it's hot,&quot; said Copeland, holding a sign reading, &quot;I Am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am wearing this hoodie,&quot; Copeland said. &quot;My children wear hoodies. Wearing a hoodie doesn't mean you are a criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Martin was shot, he was wearing a hoodie, carrying an iced tea and a bag of Skittles candy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those factors resonated with a pre-teen who had the same last name but was not related.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holding up a sign with checkmarks for &quot;iced tea,&quot; &quot;Skittles,&quot; &quot;hoodie,&quot; &quot;black&quot; and the words &quot;Am I Next?&quot; Zion Martin, 11, said he could identify with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And for more than sharing a last name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am young and black,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin also has intimate knowledge of what the slain teen's family might be feeling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I was three years old, my dad was shot and killed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother, LaTonya Martin, said her son's father was killed Aug. 23, 2004, in New York while attending a friend's funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one has been arrested for killing my dad,&quot; Zion Martin said. &quot;I am waiting for justice, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,000 people rallied for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Washington's Freedom Plaza on Saturday afternoon, demanding justice in the Florida teen's death and calling for renewed attention to racial issues in America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One good thing about this is it will start to open up people's eyes. This will show that certain changes need to be made,&quot; said Cynthia Turner, 47, who grew up in Sanford, where 17-year-old Trayvon was killed Feb. 26. As a teen herself, she said, she was sexually assaulted but the police did nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said, 'What white man would want a black girl?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That could have been me,&quot; said Turner, who now lives in Upper Marlboro, Md. &quot;I could have been buried. But I made it through. Whatever I can do now, I'm going to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man who shot Trayvon, neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, claims he did so in self-defense, according to police. He has not been arrested or charged, fueling outrage across the country. Zimmerman, 28, is a white Hispanic and his family says he is not racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the case has provoked strong feelings about race and legal justice as well as questions about Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law that allows people to use deadly force in cases of self-defense when they believe their life is at risk. Zimmerman said he acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in Saturday's crowd wore hoodies, like Trayvon did on the night he was killed, and carried what he carried from a 7-Eleven: Skittles and Arizona iced tea. But they were urged to move beyond symbols and use the death as an opportunity to make a difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida state Rep. Alan Williams, D-Tallahassee, promised the crowd justice in the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to think about where do we go from here,&quot; Williams said. &quot;It's more than rallying for justice in Sanford because justice will be served. I promise you on behalf of the Florida state House of Representatives, justice will served. But we have look beyond that. We have to think about this on Election Day. When you get tired and you don't feel like going to vote, go vote for Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have kids at home and I'm tired of racism,&quot; said Sean Suggs, 26, a bank teller who lives in Fairfax, Va. &quot;I want this to be more than just today. I want this to go for months, years.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOCAL; THE BUZZ ON FLORIDA POLITICS; Pg. 1B</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plenty of Florida Democrats are saying &quot;We told you so&quot; and calling for repeal of the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law in the wake of the Trayvon Martin shooting, but not Florida Democratic Party Chairman Rod Smith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith, a former prosecutor, cosponsored the bill as a state senator in 2005. He can't see how it could be used in defense of George Zimmerman, the Sanford volunteer neighborhood watchman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've tried and defended stand your ground cases, and I've prosecuted murder cases,&quot; Smith said. &quot;This individual (Zimmerman), as I understand the facts, moved the ground toward the confrontation. That's not a stand-your-ground defense. Unless there are facts that I'm not aware of, I think you'll see an arrest made. ... It's hard to believe that someone was not arrested that night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stand your ground passed the Florida Senate unanimously in 2005, though Democrats in the House warned that it could lead to severe unintended consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith said he still supports the law: &quot;I did not believe then, and I still have a real concern why we should put a duty to retreat on a victim. If you were genuinely defending yourself, why did you have to retreat when you were not the perpetrator?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One-on-one shooting cases without witnesses can always pose challenges for prosecutors, Smith said, but the objective evidence appears compelling in this case: &quot;We're talking about a young man shot point blank at close range after you've been told not to pursue him - and no evidence that this young man was doing anything inappropriate. ... Is it reasonable to believe the smaller person attacked the larger? The younger versus the older? The unarmed versus the armed?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Argenziano opts for Florida House race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former state Sen. Nancy Argenziano will abandon her campaign for Congress and instead move back to Citrus County and challenge incumbent Jimmie Smith for his seat in the Florida House. Argenziano had hoped to run for Congress as a Democrat, but recently a judge ruled against her challenge of a state law that prohibited her from switching parties less than a year before qualifying to run. She decided not to appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Argenziano, who currently lives in Tallahassee, said she will move back into a home she owns in unincorporated Citrus County near Crystal River. She will campaign under her current Independent Party affiliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without a major party's backing, it would have been nearly impossible to raise the money to be competitive in a congressional bid, Argenziano said Wednesday. She also didn't want to be a spoiler that prohibited a Democratic candidate from unseating incumbent Rep. Steve Southerland, a Panama City Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thrasher, Gardiner 'worked it out'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember that comment from former Republican Party of Florida chairman John Thrasher, in which he didn't want to concede defeat in the 2014 race for Senate president?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a year like this, when we have a big summer of elections, a lot of things can change, seems to me,'' Sen. Thrasher, R-St. Augustine, told reporters on Feb. 23 after failing to oust rival Sen. Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, in an attempted backroom deal that backfired. &quot;I don't think anybody has pledges until the day they get designated. To me that's what it's about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never mind. &quot;I'm supporting Andy,'' he said last week, repeating a comment he has privately told senators for weeks. &quot;We worked it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for 2016 in which Thrasher could face Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, for Senate president, that's another story - and Thrasher won't comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawsuit filed against Obama's eligibility</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larry Klayman, the conservative legal activist from Miami who ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 2004, has filed a lawsuit against the state over Barack Obama's eligibility to be on the general election ballot. Klayman wants to require Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner to confirm the eligibility of Obama before placing his name on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Klayman's release: &quot;Neither Mr. Obama, nor the Democratic Party of Florida, nor any other group has confirmed that Mr. Obama is a 'natural born citizen' since his father was a British subject born in Kenya and not a citizen of the United States. Therefore, according to Klayman, Mr. Obama is ineligible for the Office of the President of the United States until the state can confirm his eligibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klayman, the founder of Judicial Watch, spent $2.9 million on his 2004 primary campaign and won 1 percent of the vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former U.S. Rep. Mark Foley's partner of 28 years, dermatologistLayne Nisenbaum, died Thursday at age 53 after struggling with a rare form of cirrhosis of the liver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Layne was my most solid supporter through that ordeal,&quot; Foley, a Palm Beach County Republican, told the website Gossip Extra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foley had kept his homosexuality and longtime relationship with Nisenbaum secret, until 2006 when his political career blew up amid revelations that Foley had been sending graphic emails to congressional pages.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drug testing held off during legal dispute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Rick Scott clarified last week that he wants most state agencies to hold off on implementing the state worker drug-testing requirement he signed into law until the state settles an ongoing legal dispute with the American Civil Liberties Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACLU of Florida challenged Scott's Executive Order 11-58, which required agencies to change their drug-testing policies so that it applied to job applicants and random employees, in May. Scott suspended the order in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because the legal case remains unresolved, the practical and logistical issues involved with implementing drug testing across all agencies remain the same,&quot; wrote Jesse Panuccio, Scott's acting general counsel in a Tuesday memo. &quot;Accordingly, the guidance in the June 10, 2011, memo is still in place.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida NRA uber-lobbyist Marion Hammer. Gun control had seemed like a quaint relic of the 1980s. Now a young dad and Iraq war veteran is dead for standing up for a skateboarder in Valrico. And a Skittles-packing teen in Sanford is dead after rousing the suspicion of a gun-toting neighborhood watchman. Good luck next legislative session, Marion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a moment, forget about guilt or innocence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget about the Justice Department, the grand jury and the tide of protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget all of that, and ask yourself this question:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Trayvon&nbsp;Martin dead because he was black?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is not an attempt to paint George Zimmerman as a racist, nor is it a suggestion that Zimmerman's claim of self-defense is false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question has nothing to do with Florida's &quot;stand your ground'' law, Zimmerman's bloody nose or the Sanford Police Department's investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the question goes back to the very reason Zimmerman called police early one Sunday evening in February, setting in motion the chain of events that ended the life of an unarmed teenager on a quiet, residential street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, once again, is Trayvon&nbsp;Martin dead because young, black males are more readily assumed to be potential criminals in this country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is only a guess, but I would say yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For African-Americans, there is a familiar term for being pulled over by police for no apparent reason. It is called &quot;driving while black.'' We may never know for certain, but the crime in this case appears to have been &quot;walking while black.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think you would be hard-pressed to find any African-American who has not experienced that phenomenon at some point in their lives,'' said Pasco Circuit Judge Michael Andrews, who experienced it as a youth in South Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's ultimately one of the reasons I went into law and became a judge.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One by one, Andrews begins recounting the stories. Like the time he and his brother were fingerprinted by police on the side of the road because they couldn't produce a receipt for a can of Pringles they were eating from. They were 11 and 12 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was the time he purchased a sweater and was waiting for a friend to finish shopping when a store employee accused him of shoplifting and ordered him to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were the stares and whispers whenever he was in an upscale neighborhood. And, like Martin, there were the times in unfamiliar neighborhoods when people would call the police because they were unsure about Andrews or his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does this mean Zimmerman was racist for calling Sanford police when he saw Martin walking slowly down the street in a light rain? Maybe, maybe not. Does it mean Zimmerman was engaged in racial profiling? That seems more likely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was no stranger to the local police. He had called 911 and nonemergency police numbers nearly 50 times in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He complained about animals. About noisy parties. He called several times to report open garage doors on neighbors' homes, and a couple of times to report potholes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was also, according to research of the calls done by thedailybeast.com, making more frequent reports of suspicious characters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He prefaced some of the calls by saying the neighborhood had been experiencing an increase in break-ins, and a Miami Herald study of police reports confirms that was true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem with Zimmerman's recent complaints was they had one thing in common:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspicious people were always young, black males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six times in the past 10 months, he had made a report of a suspicious black male in the neighborhood. Sometimes it was a single person. Sometimes it was two people. But it was always black males, according to the report by thedailybeast.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now an argument could be made that Zimmerman was merely connecting dots if young, black males had been suspects in the recent break-ins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if you believe there is logic to that argument, you must also admit there is inherent unfairness to the vast number of innocent people swept up in that net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem is it's hard to talk about these things because we've made 'race card' a pejorative term,'' Judge Andrews said. &quot;Any time you hear someone bring up the race card, it's as if they are trying to use it to gain advantage, and the argument is discounted.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this is why it is important to ask these questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will all watch closely in the coming days to see if a grand jury decides to indict, and we will pay attention to federal inquiries of the Sanford Police Department's procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But beyond the official investigations, there is the simple question of whether this sad episode was initiated because a neighborhood watch volunteer was too eager to assume the worst of a 17-year-old student just because he was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if that is why Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is dead, it is a lesson we should all heed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The neighborhood where Trayvon Martin was killed is designed to be a haven. But metal security gates are little defense against fear, suspicion and a loaded gun.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days, Cheryl Brown has to walk the dog. - For a month - ever since her son heard someone screaming for help and her daughter called 911 and everyone heard the loud snap of a gunshot - Brown's children have been afraid to go outside. - Her youngest daughter, who is 9, won't even look out the window. She keeps seeing the dead teen's body. - &quot;That could have so easily been my son,&quot; said Brown. &quot;He wears hoodies all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown, a 40-year-old single mom who says she is &quot;mostly black,&quot; moved into the Retreat at Twin Lakes last year. She chose the gated subdivision of identical townhomes because it is racially diverse, lots of children live there and, she said, &quot;it seemed so safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, on Feb. 26, neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, as he walked from a 7-Eleven with iced tea and a bag of Skittles. Now, Brown's children linger inside. And she does dog duty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, her white boxer, Sake, led her along the sidewalk, then turned onto a manicured path stretching between two rows of townhouses. Brown stopped and pointed to a patch of shade beneath a scrawny maple tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is where Trayvon was killed,&quot; she said. &quot;He was almost home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No blood stains the grass where he lay. No flowers or football or Skittles have been placed there to remember the teenager whose death has sparked a national outcry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A memorial of balloons, teddy bears and cans of Arizona Iced Tea is growing outside the front gate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the fence, everything still looks the same. Except it's not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The building of the Retreat at Twin Lakes is a classic Florida story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Developers saw potential in the sandy acres east of Orlando and determined to turn them into an oasis. They planned a gated subdivision just 10 minutes from downtown - a cloistered community near the interstate, close to good schools, outlet malls and the magic of Disney World.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea, as always, was that people could live peacefully in a paradise where nobody could park a car on the street or paint the house an odd color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, Engle Homes began construction on 263 two-story townhouses, with upstairs porches and covered back patios and plenty of green space. Inside, the townhomes boasted granite countertops, hardwood floors, master suites and walk-in closets. Outside, there was a pond, a clubhouse and a community pool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everything was walled in, to keep out the unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With its modern Florida architecture, this secluded, gated community is like living in a resort,&quot; a spokesmodel says in a promotional video posted on YouTube. &quot;It's the perfect choice for those looking for space and comfort.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial cost of a 1,400-square-foot townhome and the pass code to that front gate: $250,000. Today, post-boom, the price has dipped below $100,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 28, moved into the Retreat in the summer of 2009 with his wife, Shellie. Records show he worked at a pressure-washing company, though neighbors said they never saw a truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right away, he started calling the police. The 911 operators translated his complaints into the bloodless shorthand of law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 26, 2009: &quot;Male driving with no headlights on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sept. 22, 2009: &quot;Yellow speed bike doing wheelies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oct. 23, 2009: &quot;Aggressive white and brown pit bull.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transcripts of Zimmerman's 911 calls during the more than two years he lived on Retreat View Circle fill 28 pages. His concerns include everything from the driver of a pickup cutting off people to a neighbor leaving his garage door open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He kept a close watch for outsiders, but it couldn't have been easy to tell who belonged and who didn't. When the housing market crashed, many townhomes were foreclosed on and the owners evicted. Dozens of investors, unable to unload the two- and three-bedroom properties, rented them to cover their upside-down mortgages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The developers had envisioned a stable neighborhood with homeowners planting long-term roots, but now townhouses were turning over all the time. Insiders moved out. Outsiders moved in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time Zimmerman shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 40 properties inside the gate were empty and more than half of the residents were renters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Including Brandy Green, who was dating Martin's dad. And Zimmerman himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin lived with his dad, who resides in the Miami area, and had visited his dad's girlfriend at the Retreat several times before. The kids in the neighborhood always looked forward to playing football with him. But to George Zimmerman, he was a stranger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last summer, residents reported three burglaries at the Retreat, said Sanford police volunteer coordinator Wendy Dorival. At the time, workers were repairing cracks in some of the buildings. Some residents worried they were leaving their ladders up - and teenagers in the Retreat were using them to break into upstairs windows. Others feared outsiders were sneaking in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gated communities aren't really any safer than other neighborhoods, said David Morgenstern, spokesman for the Sanford Police Department. &quot;Crime is comparable no matter where you go. All that gate does is make the people who live in that community feel better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If a criminal wants to get in, they can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not hard. Drivers draft behind residents with remote control passes, following them before the gates swing closed. Old renters retain the pass code and share it. Landscapers, pizza delivery people and repairmen all have access.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the break-ins, Zimmerman's calls to 911 seemed to shift, zeroing in on black males. Were black males actually responsible for any of the crimes reported in the Retreat? Impossible to say. Morgenstern, the police spokesman, said last week that he was too overwhelmed with media requests to get the arrest records on individual cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In police argot, anyone Zimmerman called about was a &quot;suspicious person,&quot; but of course it was Zimmerman who was suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 3, 2011: &quot;Black male with white tank top and black shorts ... (Zimmerman) believes subject is involved in recent (burglaries) in the neighborhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 6, 2011: &quot;Two black males, one wearing black tank top ... are near the back gate of the neighborhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, the Sanford police helped the Retreat start a neighborhood watch program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some residents called me wanting to do a startup,&quot; said Dorival, a civilian police employee. About 30 people came to the clubhouse for that first session, she said. &quot;Everyone was enthusiastic.&quot; Zimmerman volunteered to be captain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I told them, this is not about being a vigilante police force,&quot; Dorival said. &quot;You're not even supposed to patrol on neighborhood watch. And you're certainly not supposed to carry a gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first two months of this year, at the Retreat at Twin Lakes, the Sanford police logged 51 calls for service. Half were just people requesting information. The others included eight burglaries, two bike thefts and three simple assaults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's last 911 call came on Feb. 26, at 7:11 p.m. &quot;Black male, late teens, dark gray hoodie, jeans or sweatpants walking around area,&quot; the dispatcher recorded. A minute later: &quot;Subject now running towards back entrance of complex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a recording of the call, you can hear Zimmerman say, &quot;He's got his hand in his waistband. Something is wrong with him.&quot; Then, &quot;He's running toward the back entrance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispatcher told Zimmerman not to follow him. A patrol officer was on the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes later, other residents at the Retreat started calling:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A guy's yelling for help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just heard a gunshot right outside our house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't hear any more screaming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm pretty sure the guy's dead out here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is, like, a nice neighborhood. Oh my god! Why would someone just kill someone like that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheryl Brown was at a Walmart that night when her daughter called, crying. She hurried home to find police blocking the gates to her subdivision. She parked her car across the street and ran to her kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her son, Austin, was hysterical. He had been right there, walking the dog, when he heard the cry for help. But then Sake had pulled off the leash. As her son chased the boxer, he had heard the gunshot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What if the dog hadn't gotten loose? What if he had tried to help? My son is 13,&quot; Brown said. &quot;He looks a lot like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For her son's whole life, Brown said, she has told him: If someone's chasing you, run. &quot;What if it's a kidnapper? Or someone trying to beat or rob you?&quot; she asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She stopped walking the dog and shook her head. &quot;But if he runs, does that make him even more suspicious?&quot; Brown wiped her eyes. &quot;What makes someone suspicious? That's what worries me the most.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every building at the Retreat at Twin Lakes is painted some shade of brown: taupe, terra cotta, khaki. Every townhome has a garage out front and a keypad on the door handle - so if someone steals your keys they can't get inside. Dozens of yards have signs alerting would-be intruders of alarm systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a peaceful place. We don't have problems here,&quot; Tito Ortiz, 62, said the other day beside his mailbox. A former minister, Ortiz remarried five years ago and bought a house in the Retreat for his new bride. Somewhere they would be safe to grow old together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what happened with that boy. I'm so surprised that happened here,&quot; he said. But he doesn't worry about staying in the neighborhood and has no intention of moving. &quot;We are still going to find our peace here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many residents of the gated community declined to talk to reporters. Others were eager to give their opinions, but not their names. Several said they had started carrying guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one had seen Zimmerman. Or Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's dad. Except on the news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie Meyers, 26, and her two preschoolers walked through the neighborhood to place silk violets on the teenager's memorial. She and her husband moved here two years ago to be behind a gate, to be surrounded by other families with kids. &quot;We're thinking about moving now,&quot; said Meyers, who teaches middle school. &quot;We don't want to stay here, in a place something like this could happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, on the other side of the complex, Thomas Ransburg, 20, was outside talking to his girlfriend. Ransburg has lived behind the gate since January, he said, and sees no reason to move now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few months ago, he was hanging out with a friend who lives in another townhouse. &quot;But that day, he forgot his key,&quot; said Ransburg. So they walked around to the back patio and opened the sliding glass door. Someone saw them and called the police. They spent four hours at the station, trying to convince investigators his friend really lived there. &quot;They thought we were trying to rob it or something,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ransburg, who is black and wears long dreadlocks, laughed at the memory, swore it didn't make him angry, and said he understood. &quot;I don't think it was racial,&quot; he said. &quot;I guess we just looked suspicious. Everyone's always been real friendly back here. People smile and wave. All the little kids run around. There's always laughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just then, three teenage males walked through the unlocked side gate, down the walkway toward Ransburg. T.J. Jones and his twin brother, T.Y., 14, and their cousin James Young, 13, have lived in the complex for two years. Their moms moved here from apartments to give the boys more room and a safe place to play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boys, who are black, used to play football with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin &quot;right there on that grass where he died,&quot; said T.Y.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told Ransburg that their mom won't let them outside after dark anymore. She is worried someone might think they are &quot;suspicious or something,&quot; said T.J. &quot;She keeps telling us to be careful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ransburg nodded, and pointed at the townhouse across the street. &quot;You see that door? That's my door,&quot; he told the boys. &quot;If anyone is ever bothering you or following you, if you ever feel scared, that's my door. Knock on it. I'll be there to get your back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community pool was empty that afternoon. So was the clubhouse. On the bulletin board, there were two fliers. One was a notice from the homeowners' association: &quot;All residents are part of the Neighborhood Watch program and are encouraged to get to know your neighbors and look out for one another! ... There is also a neighborhood watch meeting with Officer Wendy on Thursday, March 29th, 7 p.m.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other flier said simply, &quot;Neighborhood Watch meeting canceled.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Unabomber. Joe Maddon. Rocky Balboa. Your babysitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They all wear a hood. A hoodie. In Saskatchewan, a bunny hug or a cotton popover. It is a ubiquitous, homogenized garment, something designed for comfort, warmth and function that also has a notorious double life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, black and 17, was walking through a gated Sanford subdivision in February. George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, followed him and shot him to death. Trayvon was carrying Skittles and iced tea, no gun. Zimmerman told a 911 operator that Trayvon looked suspicious, that he was wearing a hoodie. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting ignited a debate about Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, but it carries an interesting subtext about the weight we assign fashion. In Trayvon's case the hoodie was harmless, but we have pumped it so full of negative meaning that on Friday Fox News host Geraldo Rivera proclaimed that parents should not let black and Latino children wear hoodies. &quot;I think the hoodie is as much responsible for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death as George Zimmerman was,&quot; he said. Basketball stars LeBron James and Dwyane Wade tweeted hoodie photos Friday, denouncing stereotypes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days earlier, outraged people organized a Million Hoodie March in New York City, pulling hoods over their heads and carrying photos of Trayvon wearing a hoodie. It was clear reminder that when worn by someone older, or whiter, the hoodie is just a sweatshirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The power of a piece of cotton clothing to color our perceptions comes through in a second image of Trayvon in a red T-shirt from Hollister, a shop for middle-class teens. Suspicious doesn't come to mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's too easy to pin his character on any shirt - especially the hoodie, which means different things to different people. Hoodies don't belong to any one class now. They never have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Folklore gives us Robin Hood and Little Red Riding Hood, one an outlaw, the other a child pursued by a wolf. Both wore hoods. In real life, 19th century Christian monks and nuns wore cowls. Templars, who protected travelers, wore white-hooded cloaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Champion company produced the first sweatshirt hoodies in the 1930s, marketed to warm freezing workers in New York warehouses. Hoodies exploded in the 1970s with the proliferation of hip-hop and graffiti culture. Then came a meat-punching, stair-running Philadelphia fighternamed Rocky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They took on a subversive bent, the way greased ducktails and leather jackets did in the 1950s, the way long hair and flared pants did in the '60s. But that also made them sexy. Grace Jones wore hoods, and Roy Halston Frowick outfitted women in his legendary long hooded dresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoodies didn't get a bad reputation for no reason. People used them to hide their faces, to do bad things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In places like the United Kingdom the hoodie jumped from social statement to social stigma.Some malls and schools banned hoodies, which had become the unofficial uniform of petty thieves and hooligans. Police in Brisbane, Australia, urged shopkeepers to have &quot;hoodie-free zones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2006, David Cameron, then the leader of the British conservative party, made a valiant attempt to get &quot;people in suits&quot; to move past the hoodie's pejorative associations. &quot;For some, the hoodie represents all that's wrong about youth culture in Britain today. For me, adult society's response to the hoodie shows how far we are from finding the long-term answers to put things right.&quot; Detractors labeled it the &quot;hug a hoodie&quot; speech. The next year, a 4-year-old girl was asked to take down her hood at a Welsh amusement park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In America, anti-hoodie hysteria hasn't been quite as shrill, but we have our own issues. Hoodies were recently banned as part of a sweeping dress code update at Clearwater High School, administrators said, because students used them to hide cell phones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it was a dark hoodie that Nick Lindsey was seen wearing the night police say he shot and killed St. Petersburg Officer David Crawford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But such are the ways of fashion that even that kind of morbid link isn't enough to stop Americans from buying them at every store in the mall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Target. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Old Navy, a place that sells patriotic flag shirts on the Fourth of July. Hot Topic sells almost 200 varieties, in motifs from zombie to Barbie to bacon. There are hoodies with cat ears, hoodies with fur, hoodies with dinosaur spikes. The city of New York sells official New York Police Department hoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people wear them because everyone else is wearing them, not because they want trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aline Bryant, petite, blond and 22, sat in a journalism class at the University of South Florida on Wednesday night, nestled in a navy blue hoodie from Aeropostale. Her hood was lined with preppy green and blue plaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I probably have at least four,&quot; she said. &quot;I still have my hoodie from high school. ... I don't see someone in a hoodie and immediately think I should run away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it starts to rain on campus, Aline puts the hood up. That's what it's for. To cover your head. Not to reduce you to a simplistic caricature, a Grim Reaper or a Kenny from South Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was raining the night Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humans give fashion its meaning. Not the other way around.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Social media play a role in drawing a crowd to a rally in the city that echoes calls for justice in the case of the slain Sanford teen.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a rally with the flavor of a 1960s civil rights march. But this one came in the age of Facebook and the smartphone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 600 and 1,000 people marched to one of Tampa's busiest intersections Saturday in a call for justice in the case of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. He's the unarmed, black 17-year-old who was shot and killed on Feb. 26 by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 28, who claimed self-defense in the shooting, has not been arrested or charged, sparking national outrage. Zimmerman's father is white, his mother Latina, according to neighbors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of Martin's family attended the event, organizers said, but were not available for interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally started in Al Lopez Park. Protesters carried signs that said &quot;I am Trayvon&quot; or &quot;Justice for Trayvon.&quot; They marched to the intersection of N Dale Mabry Highway and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, often chanting &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in the crowd wore hoodies or carried bags of Skittles, just as Martin did when he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event was organized by a small Facebook group called Real Talk: Real Answers, and organizers said they were stunned to draw such a large crowd just 72 hours after they first talked of holding the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decades ago, the black community organized around its churches with calls to action often coming from the pulpit. And while that is still true, organizers said social media have amplified the conversation about race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Social media have expanded the racial discussion in this country and in the world,&quot; said Jean Vixamar, 37, one of the leaders of the Facebook group. Social media, he said, &quot;erase barriers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artist Rob Mitchell, 23, of Tampa said he learned of the event through Facebook. &quot;I caught the buzz,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the technology has changed, the message of racial equality and justice was an echo of the protests by earlier generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jazz Young, 20, of Tampa came to the rally with her two young sons and said Martin's death is a chilling reminder to any mother about how quickly tragedy can strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was someone's baby,&quot; Young said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brande Ford, 22, of Tampa attended with her 2-year-old daughter. She said the Martin case showed the black community that while issues of race have improved since the days of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., there was still work to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This happened even though we have a black president and all,&quot; Ford said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orlando Davis, 40, host of the morning show on hip-hop station WLLD-FM (Wild 94.1), said social media had revolutionized protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This makes a president address this issue,&quot; Davis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama referenced the case on Friday, saying, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters were encouraged to call Gov. Rick Scott's office. While Scott appointed a special prosecutor to the Martin case, many in the crowd said they worried that the ineptness of Sanford police might have guaranteed Zimmerman would never be charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God wants this to be brought out,&quot; said Krystal Bowens, one of the organizers. &quot;He wants justice. ... The truth will come out. I know it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonya Wideman, 47, of Tampa held a sign that said, &quot;Please don't kill my son.&quot; Her T-shirt was emblazoned, &quot;Florida's Free Monsters.&quot; Below were pictures of Zimmerman and Casey Anthony, who was acquitted last year in the death of her 2-year-old daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinonye Umunnah, 32, of Gibsonton said Facebook empowers communities large and small. King, she said, accomplished so much before his 1968 death. But she tried to imagine what he might have accomplished with a tool like Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would have been amazing,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement will host a community meeting for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin at 4 p.m. today at the Uhuru House at 1245 18th Ave. S in St. Petersburg. Organizers will discuss plans for a St. Petersburg rally to be held at 11 a.m. Saturday. For more information, call (727) 821-6620.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 25--Among the penances we pay for our long struggle to overcome bigotry is a political correctness in everything we say. In our rush to cover our past sins, we are wound so tightly that even to hint that we aren't one large happy family is akin to suggesting we might not have come as far as our ethnically balanced TV commercials indicate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of a black teen-ager almost a month ago in Sanford for no apparent reason other than he looked &quot;suspicious&quot; -- walking down a sidewalk at night; going to a house in a gated community -- has raised the national conscience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real issue, the one that bubbles near the surface, is not so much the event itself in which a neighborhood watchman reportedly disregarded a police dispatcher's instructions, and allegedly followed and shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. It goes deeper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a violent country. People get killed every day. The number of homicides involving guns hovers around 10,000 annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this isn't about gun control, other than neighborhood watch patrols are supposed to be unarmed and report suspicious people to police, not go after them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At many levels, what happened in the minutes, days and weeks following the death of Martin paints an ugly picture of imbalance, whether intentional or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you have read the sketchy accounts of how Sanford police and an entire system treated the victim and his alleged killer, it is easy to arrive at uncomfortable conclusions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are plenty of over-eager, possibly racist thugs who could do what those appalled by the teen's death have accused the alleged gunman of doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More disturbing is if we examine our own reactions to what now is happening. I usually get ticked when I see the Jesse Jacksons and Al Sharptons stepping in front of cameras to address a controversy with racial overtones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But isn't it true that if this had been a white teenager walking through a black neighborhood at night, the repercussions -- from the way the event was investigated, to media coverage, to the way you and I reacted -- would be different?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've heard the voices this week -- your neighbors here in Tampa. Some try to defend the killing, reaching for justification in a slaying that shouldn't have happened. &quot;He shouldn't have been there...&quot; &quot;He should have kept on walking...&quot; &quot;Why was he wearing a hoodie?...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're a nation that rightfully can shine a light on how far we have come in guaranteeing equal opportunities for everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is only when tragedies such as this one occur that we are reminded we still are growing and reaching for an inner conviction that will allow us to practice what we preach.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whenever Norton Bonaparte encountered rough sledding during his years as Topeka's city manager, his predicaments made the local news but didn't generate too much interest outside the immediate area or Kansas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not the case in Sanford, Fla., where Bonaparte is a city manager under fire for not firing the police chief, who declined to arrest a neighborhood watch captain who fatally shot an unarmed 17-year-old black youth, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such is the power of social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting occurred Feb. 26, and most of the nation was unaware of it until a couple of weeks ago when a few people put messages about the incident on Twitter and other social media websites. A syndicated radio host the next day added a few details and sent a message to his 65,000 Twitter followers and 585,000 Facebook fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From there, the story went viral and people across the country now know who Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is. They also are familiar with the names George Zimmerman, the watch captain, Bonaparte, and Bill Lee Jr., the Sanford police chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Associated Press reports Martin lived in Miami but was visiting family in Sanford. He walked to a convenience store and was on his way back to the family home when he was spotted by Zimmerman, who was on patrol. The watch captain called police, who said he could stop following the youth and that they would check him out. For some reason, Zimmerman continued to follow Martin and then stopped his vehicle and approached the youth. The shooting followed a chase and fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman is claiming self-defense and cites Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which gives people the latitude to use deadly force instead of retreating during a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department and FBI are now investigating the case and the local prosecutor has convened a grand jury to determine whether to charge Zimmerman, the son of a white man and Hispanic woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll let the federal law enforcement agencies and a grand jury sort out the facts and decide whether Zimmerman should be charged. It's not our place to decide guilt or innocence, or whether Bonaparte should fire the police chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, we're using the case today as yet another example of the power of Twitter and other social media, which can be used for good or evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the investigations determine Zimmerman crossed a line and should be charged in connection with Martin's death, certainly those first few tweets mourning his loss and asking for justice served a purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social media isn't used only for good causes, however. We've all heard stories about people whose lives were ruined - some ending in suicide - when someone posted a malicious message on one of the various social media sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the evil side of social media. They distribute false information just as rapidly and to just as many people as they do the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're going to have to live with the good and the evil, but we don't have to accept every posting at face value. It doesn't hurt to pause and think, or even do some fact checking, before sending information further along its way.</SPAN></P>

By the end of the night, she was among eight dead, including six children, in one of the city's deadliest house fires in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blaze tore through the two-story home while the family slept early Saturday, hours after the last guest left Carter-Camp's party, authorities said. The dead children ranged from 18 months to 8. A seventh child, a 7-year-old boy, was hospitalized on life support. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause was under investigation, although arson wasn't suspected, Charleston Mayor Danny Jones said. The fire started about 2:30 a.m. Topeka time on the first floor. Jones said the home had just one working smoke detector; the city required several.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INVESTIGATORS SAY SOLDIER SPLIT KILLING SPREE: U.S. investigators believe the U.S. soldier accused of killing 17 Afghan civilians split the slaughter into two episodes, returning to his base after the first attack and later slipping away to kill again, two American officials said Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This scenario seems to support the U.S. government's assertion - contested by some Afghans - that the killings were done by one person, since they would have been perpetrated over a longer period of time than assumed when Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales was detained March 11 outside his base in southern Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it also raises new questions about how Bales, who was formally charged Friday with 17 counts of premeditated murder and other crimes, could have carried out the nighttime attacks without drawing attention from any Americans on the Kandahar province base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATTORNEYS IN TRAYVON&nbsp;MARTIN CASE MAKE ARGUMENTS: Attorneys for the family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and the Florida neighborhood watch captain who fatally shot the unarmed teen spoke Saturday on the federal investigation of the death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daryl D. Parks, an attorney for the Martin family, told board members of the National Association of Black Journalists that family members met with federal and local officials for more than an hour Thursday. He said the family left the meeting &quot;with a strong sense that Justice was very committed&quot; to investigating the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that it was rather clear that the attorney general is quite aware of the situation,&quot; Parks said, referring to Eric Holder. &quot;They have devoted a great deal of resources into looking into this matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For us to have had all the people who were there with us and the magnitude of the conversation - this is a very high priority for this administration,&quot; he said in a wide-ranging interview.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 70 people gathered Saturday evening on the south side of the Statehouse grounds in Topeka to lend their voices to the national debate that has ensued since a teenager was fatally shot in an Orlando, Fla., suburb last month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally was organized by Sonny Scroggins, a community activist, and featured about a dozen signs in support of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, and the locally embattled but popular clothing option - hoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the protest signs at the rally were: &quot;Justice must be served,&quot; &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin innocent,&quot; &quot;Occupy the hood,&quot; &quot;Where's the justice&quot; and &quot;Hell no, hoodies won't go!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lewis Jenkins, a retired Topekan, said he didn't intend to give a speech, but Scroggins asked that of him and Jenkins obliged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we don't take a stand now our children and grandchildren will be in trouble,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenkins, who said he has taken his commentary to news and social media websites by posting his thoughts, said it is time for folks to stand up. He said injustice is injustice - everyone should be afforded the same opportunities regardless of race or creed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, who is black, was shot to death Feb. 26 in Sanford City, Fla. George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, was the triggerman. Zimmerman has been identified in news accounts as being both white and Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was unarmed at the time of the shooting, and Zimmerman, who hasn't been arrested, said he acted in self defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoodies came into the local spotlight when Topeka's police chief in February suggested crime could be deterred by making people remove their hoods before entering a business. Topeka's mayor said he wanted discussion on the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arturo Lassiter said he attended the rally to show his support in hopes that justice will be served.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every person deserves protection,&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone deserves to have life and all of their rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether innocent or guilty, Lassiter said, the shooter needs to have his day in court so the facts can come out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lassiter, who has a young family, said he can identify with the Martins in that he would want all the support he could muster if he lost a member of his family to violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attentive audience provided occasional shouts of agreement or encouragement to the multiple speakers. Minister Ronnie Lassiter Jr., of Faith Temple Church of God in Christ, was the last speaker at the rally, which lasted nearly 40 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dressed in a black shirt with white lettering that declared &quot;The answer is Jesus&quot; on its front, the minister said each person knows the difference between right and wrong. He quoted a passage from Romans 2:15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's not because I said it.&quot; Lassiter said. &quot;It's not because of a law or a congressman or a president who said it, it's because the Bible says it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Christ will set you free and save you from anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't need guns, not if you have the spirit of God,&quot; Lassiter said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, FLA.-Members of the New Black Panther Party are offering a $10,000 (U.S.) reward for the &quot;capture&quot; of George Zimmerman, leader Mikhail Muhammad announced Saturday during a rally in a day of nationwide protests against the slaying of a Florida teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked whether he was inciting violence to get vigilante justice for slain teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Muhammad replied: &quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bounty announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilization of 5,000 black men to capture George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer in a gated community considered mostly white, who shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on Feb. 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman remains free and uncharged over the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the shooting in Sanford, a town just north of Orlando, has galvanized America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland and Jacksonville - where the 28-year-old worked before the shooting, employees there told the Orlando Sentinel. But he declined to say when they will begin their hunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman believed the young man walking through the gated community in a &quot;hoodie,&quot; or hooded sweatshirt, looked suspicious, said his lawyer, Craig Sonner, and called the police nonemergency line to report a suspicious person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, unarmed, had been walking back to his father's fianc&eacute;e's townhouse. Zimmerman followed and an altercation ensued, ending when Zimmerman shot him before officers could respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the City of Sanford website, city manager Norton Bonaparte says Zimmerman &quot;holds a concealed weapon permit issued from the state of Florida,&quot; allowing him to carry a gun that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Saturday's protest in Sanford, leader Muhammad led the Panther protest in chanting &quot;Justice for Trayvon!&quot; and &quot;Black Power!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the government won't do the job, we'll do it,&quot; he said, leading his group of eight party members in chants like &quot;freedom or death&quot; and &quot;justice for Trayvon&quot; while making the iconic gesture of raising their fists into the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad added that the group's national chairman, Dr. Malik Zulu Shabaz, is receiving donations from black entertainers and athletes. They hope to collect $1 million by next week, he added.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[CLARIFICATION RAN 20120327 --A Sunday News editorial this week noted that Craig Sonner, attorney for George Zimmerman, said Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law did not apply in the case of his client, who is accused of killing teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Sonner has subsequently changed his position and now says the law does apply. ]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A shooting in Florida last month left a black teenager dead in what appears to have been a completely unjustified killing. As Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family grieves and thousands speak out in protest of both the killing and the seemingly inexplicable failure of local police to arrest and charge the shooter, some politically minded folks are using the shooting to argue for the repeal of so-called &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws. That is an overly hasty reaction that would endanger innocent people in New Hampshire and 20 other states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida passed its &quot;stand your ground&quot; law in 2005. It states: &quot;A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, the self-appointed protector of the neighborhood in which Martin was walking that night, has claimed self-defense. That is hard to square with the fact that Zimmerman reportedly pursued Martin after being advised by police not to. Nonetheless, the law is so poorly worded that police wound up not arresting Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is that the fault of the law? Harvard Law professor Jeannie Suk wrote in The New York Times last week: &quot;The real outrages are not actually in the provisions of the new self-defense laws, as nothing in those laws give permission to shoot or refuse to retreat when one isn't attacked to begin with. The dangers lie rather in incorrect and confused law enforcement perceptions of what the law allows, fueled by the cultural background and emotions that surrounded the laws' passage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet the &quot;incorrect and confused law enforcement perceptions&quot; stem directly from confusing legal wording. Florida's law never explicitly states that lethal force is reserved for self-defense only. In that regard, it is very different from New Hampshire's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Hampshire's law took effect last November. Like Florida's, it allows the use of deadly force not just on one's property, but anywhere one &quot;has a right to be.&quot; But unlike Florida's, it makes the use of deadly force legal only if the person using it &quot;was not the initial aggressor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law explicitly states, &quot;nor is the use of deadly force justifiable when, with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily harm, the person has provoked the use of force against himself or herself in the same encounter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those clauses should be in all &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws, which should not be repealed because of this tragic encounter - especially considering that Zimmerman's attorney says Florida's law does not even apply in this case. Zimmerman is claiming self defense, but not based on the &quot;stand your ground law.&quot; Those laws are not the issue here, though some activists are trying to use the shooting to discredit them. We would do great public disservice if we let them get away with that.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few weeks ago, I was standing outside a posh bar on the Lower East Side of Manhattan with my friends of almost two decades. I made an offhanded comment about the ratio of blonde-haired-blue-eyed chicks to brown girls like me. It seemed like a zillion to one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My pals, who are white, didn't get why I was bringing this up. &quot;No one cares about race except you,&quot; one said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I tried to explain my frustration with having to always choose between an all-black experience or being the &quot;only one,&quot; whether at work, in grad school or even out for a night in New York. I waited for a nod of sympathy; instead, my best friend threw her hands up and said: &quot;How can we all be racist? Look at who is president!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I didn't have a response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right now the nation has embarked on a massive conversation about race surrounding the tragic death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Florida. On Friday, President Obama  weighed in. &quot;I think all of us have to do some soul searching to figure out: How does something like this happen?&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's an important conversation to have - but I fear it won't lead anywhere. After all, we've seen plenty of these debates in recent years, invariably prompted by some tragedy or controversy. Think Troy Davis. Or Shirley Sherrod. Or Jeremiah Wright. Or Henry Louis Gates Jr. Or even Rodney King. We have big debates over racial prejudice and disparities in this country, and then nothing happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thought things would be different by now. The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin story flared up exactly four years after Obama's famous campaign speech on race in Philadelphia, a speech that made so many of us believe that Obama would launch a serious, enduring dialogue. But the election of the first black president hasn't made it easier to talk about race in America. It's made it harder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's measured words on Friday only highlighted  how removed the president seems from the candidate who gave that stirring speech on race four years ago. Obama was asked directly about &quot;allegations of lingering racism in our society,&quot; but he shied away. He rightly used caution in talking about a case that the Justice Department is investigating, and he offered a moving sentiment for Martin's parents, saying, &quot;If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon.&quot; But he hasn't grappled with this tragedy, or with racial disparities and divisions, along with us, guiding us in a way that only he can - as the commander in chief, as a lawyer, as a community leader and as a black man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama presidency is &quot;post-racial&quot; only in the sense that it gives us an excuse not to grapple with race anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I sat at my desk in a newsroom four years ago, Obama's speech captivated me. Here was a politician who embraced his biracial heritage but also understood how tough it can be to navigate 21st-century America as a black person. A man who lived multiculturalism as much in his private life as his public life and could relate to what it was like to have someone who loved him dearly - his white grandmother - make comments about race that made him cringe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I understood that this was a speech made out of political necessity, in response to the controversy surrounding Wright, his onetime minister. Obama didn't make any bold proposals or even outline policies for his White House, as John F. Kennedy did when talking about religion almost 50 years prior. Yet he genuinely seemed to want us to grapple with race - to talk about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we've never really worked through - a part of our union that we have yet to perfect,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once Obama became president, I thought he might be able to somehow help us break through the status quo of awkwardness and silence on race. And I wanted to see him tackle racial inequalities through federal policy, making the system more equitable and fair for Americans of all colors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the memory of the speech that day is a reminder of how little the conversation has changed. Less than a year after Obama was elected, Gates, a Harvard professor, was arrested trying to break into his own home, creating a firestorm over racial profiling. The following year, Sherrod was fired from the Department of Agriculture after an edited video misconstrued her comments about her work with a white farmer, depicting her as racist. In 2010, a black congressman claimed that a tea party protester spit on him and shouted racial epithets during a political rally. More recently, we've witnessed racially insensitive rhetoric surrounding the rise of Taiwanese American basketball player Jeremy Lin. And of course now the Martin tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, Obama said some people had implied that his candidacy was &quot;somehow an exercise in affirmative action; that it's based solely on the desire of wide-eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap.&quot; He dismissed that notion. But the idea - of racial reconciliation on the cheap, with deep divides still prevalent - reflects what I feel in my professional and personal life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have encountered many people who seem to believe, subconsciously or not, that Obama's win is proof that America has reached the mountaintop. What more is there to say about race, they ask me, after this country so proudly and overwhelmingly elected a black president? They cite success stories as disparate as Oprah Winfrey, Jay-Z and former Time Warner chief Dick Parsons. But Oprah's billions don't counteract the dire poverty and unemployment rates in the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the most well-intentioned white people, who fundamentally understand the challenges of race in America, often can't understand why race, as a subject to wrestle with, can never be &quot;over.&quot; They can't understand what it's like to walk down the street and have someone fear you just because of your race. Or to go to your doctor's office after-hours to pick something up and have someone think you're the maid. Or to have someone give you a virtual pat on the head for being &quot;articulate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they certainly won't admit that thugged-out guys scare them. Or that if they saw a young black man in a hoodie walking in their neighborhood, like Martin was in his father's neighborhood outside Orlando last month, they wouldn't call 911 but they might cross the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as no well-intentioned person would ever admit those things, no one wants to admit that Obama's election has changed the way we talk about race. But he's the elephant in the room peering over so many discussions. His election is part of the reason that blacks, especially those who have &quot;made it,&quot; are hesitant to talk about persistent racial inequality. We don't want to be accused of whining or being angry for bringing up a problem that many people think is now relegated to history. After all, if Obama could do it, so can any black man, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll be the first to admit that I struggle with starting these conversations myself when I have personally seen so much progress from my grandparents' generation to my own. But there is still so much to talk about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do I articulate that it's harder for me to find jobs with a &quot;ghetto sounding&quot; name, when a man with a &quot;funny sounding&quot; name holds the highest office in the land?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do I explain how it feels to have almost every accomplishment that I've ever achieved be attributed to affirmative action? Most recently, a white PhD student in my program told me that I would sail through graduate school and land a wonderful gig, despite the difficult job climate, because of the &quot;black thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or how can I not think of redlining's impact when I, with my good credit and sizable down payment, receive notification that I, too, had been a victim of a discriminatory lender when I bought my condo?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be unreasonable to ask the president to spend most of his time talking about race. I don't need him to attack former House speaker Newt Gingrichevery time he calls Obamathe &quot;food stamp president.&quot; But with the recession's disproportionate impact on black Americans, the spirited immigration debate and the Occupy movement's focus on economic inequality, I am convinced that now is a good time to talk about race. Even if we are tired of it. (A 2010 Blair-Rockefeller Poll found that 56 percent of whites said we talk about race too much, compared with 18.2 percent of blacks.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billy Vaughn, a diversity expert who trains Fortune 500 and federal employees on how to become more culturally competent, said that Americans think they're &quot;open and tolerant&quot; - but no one knows the best way to be open and tolerant. He said minorities tend to be more comfortable talking about race because they're exposed to discussions about it in their communities, but this doesn't mean that they understand how to engage in those tough conversations any better than other groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People of color are saying that 'I want you to get it,' and the privileged people are saying that 'I'm not doing it.' . . . The whole conversation can get out of hand because people are talking past each other,&quot; Vaughn said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the president has not really continued the conversation. He seems to speak about race only when absolutely necessary. That's disappointing. We need more than a beer summit to hash out the very real problems that he talked about just four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Obama knows it. In a 2010 address to the National Urban League during the Sherrod controversy, he noted that while progress has been made on promoting fairness and equality, there is still &quot;work to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should all make more of an effort to discuss with one another, in a truthful and mature and responsible way, the divides that still exist - the discrimination that's still out there, the prejudices that still hold us back. A discussion that needs to take place not on cable TV, not just through a bunch of academic symposia or fancy commissions or panels, not through political posturing, but around kitchen tables, and water coolers, and church basements, and in our schools, and with our kids all across the country,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's right, of course. That speech, more than the sweeping address in Philadelphia, offers the kind of insight that could lead to real change. Because kitchen tables, water coolers or bars in New York City are where real racial progress can be achieved in America. And that's where I thought having Obama in the White House might make a bigger difference.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the rain trickled down on Freedom Plaza on Saturday afternoon, young men pulled their hoodies up to cover their heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; the young men chanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They gathered in memory of Martin, whose death at the hands of a neighborhood watch volunteer has stirred the passions of the nation, launched federal and state investigations, and fueled calls for justice in rallies across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were young men like Darryl Jackson, 15, of Largo, who said after the event that he came with his mother, Elisa, because &quot;it could have been me.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, a black Florida teenager, was fatally shot last month as he walked back from a convenience store toward a home in a gated community while wearing a hoodie to cover his head from the rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're standing up today because we are all Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; said the Rev. Graylan Hagler of Plymouth Congregational Church of Christ in the District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, whose father is white and mother is Hispanic, said he killed the 17-year-old in self-defense. He has not been arrested. Martin, who was unarmed, was carrying a bag of Skittles and a can of iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to get to the bottom of this,&quot; comedian and activist Dick Gregory told the crowd of nearly 1,500 people at Freedom Plaza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoodie-clad protesters carried placards with Martin's image and signs that read: &quot;No Justice, No Peace&quot; and &quot;Justice For Trayvon.&quot; Others held bags of Skittles above their heads, chanting &quot;Skittles and tea are not suspicious to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar rallies have taken place in major cities across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday night, thousands participated in the Million Hoodie March in Philadelphia, and thousands rallied on Wednesday night in Sanford, Fla., the town where Martin was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many demonstrators Saturday wore black and hoodies, clothes similar to what Martin wore the day he was killed. Zimmerman, 28, followed Martin through the gated community and told a 911 operator that the teenager looked suspicious. The 911 operator directed Zimmerman not to pursue the teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elisa Jackson said she was compelled to participate in Saturday's event. &quot;I don't want to wait until it happens to my son, because Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is my son,&quot; she said. &quot;I had to take a stand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio host Joe Madison said Martin's shooting &quot;is nothing but a 21st-century Emmett Till.&quot; He called for a national hoodie day April 10, when the grand jury is scheduled to meet in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some speakers used the rally as an opportunity to encourage the protesters to be more active in their communities and less apathetic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't just about today,&quot; said the Rev. Tony Lee, pastor of Community of Hope African Methodist Episcopal Church in Temple Hills. &quot;If this stops today, it doesn't mean anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another community activist said he wanted to see the &quot;same indignation&quot; over black-on-black crime, a suggestion that resulted in huge applause from the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers of the rally said they hoped it offered support to the Martin family and prods Florida authorities to prosecute Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want Zimmerman prosecuted [and for the case to be] handled in a thorough and impartial manner,&quot; said Heather Raspberry of the District, who helped organize the event using Facebook and Twitter. &quot;We just want justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the speakers echoed the words of President Obama, who weighed in on the incident Friday, speaking about it from a personal standpoint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said from the Rose Garden. &quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama did not address local law enforcement's efforts or call for Zimmerman's arrest. Instead, he directed his comments to Martin's parents, saying they &quot;are right to expect that all of us, as Americans, are going to treat this with the seriousness it deserves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millions of people have taken to social media in support of Martin, posting pictures of themselves wearing hoodies and asking &quot;Do I look suspicious?&quot; and adding pictures of Martin on Facebook and Twitter pages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the March 21 editorial &quot;A death in Florida&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's killing seems open and shut: George Zimmerman admitted the shooting and was recorded telling the police dispatcher that the person he was following was running away. Mr. Zimmerman was accordingly advised not to follow because an officer was on the way. He apparently ignored the instructions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Self-defense cannot possibly be claimed by a pursuer. Only the target being pursued, believed to be Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in this case, can make such a claim, and he's dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Trolinger, Ellicott City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courtland Milloy's thoughtful March 21 Metro column, &quot;Black fathers need to take a stand against injustice,&quot; was marred by one sentiment: &quot;Boys do not want to see their mothers struggling. It's different with fathers. Seeing a dad redress a wrong teaches the son how to stand up for himself - and his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, there is no reason to think that a child is less upset by seeing his father, rather than his mother, &quot;struggling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, it was unnecessary to drag a dated stereotype into this argument and to portray fathers as a better example for boys of how to stand up for themselves and to redress wrongs. It was my mother who, by example and lesson, fought against social wrongs and taught me how to stand up to bullies. My father certainly reinforced and discussed these notions in valuable ways, but my mother was the warrior in the family. Both parents can serve as valuable role models and teachers for just about any type of life lesson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of this is to say that Mr. Milloy's primary point, that black fathers need to be more involved in protecting, teaching and advocating for their sons, is somehow flawed. But why try to shove mothers into a restraining stereotype along the way?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Frandsen, Takoma Park</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death is tragic, but George Zimmerman is not the party primarily at fault. Rather, Florida's legislature and governor bear most of the responsibility. Placing concealed weapons in the hands of untrained persons outside the home and then, in effect, immunizing them from prosecution is a formula not for effective law enforcement or personal protection but, rather, for death. While I sincerely hope that Florida and other states with similar laws reexamine them, something tells me that their &quot;Wild West&quot; attitude toward responsible gun control, ownership and use is not likely to change anytime soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce N. Shulman, Silver Spring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must leave it up to state and federal investigators to determine whether a hate crime occurred. But even if those investigations conclude there was none, there is a term for an untrained neighborhood watch volunteer with a gun: vigilante. And that is frightening. At a minimum, prosecutors should consider whether this type of  dangerous conduct warrants criminal charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in Florida last week has sparked a national debate over &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in many states, fights over the controversial legislation have been going on for years without garnering much attention from anyone other than prosecutors and gun-rights activists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although George Zimmerman admits to shooting Martin, he says he acted in self-defense and has not been arrested. Under a 2005 Florida law, a citizen who uses deadly force is immune from prosecution when &quot;he or she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backed by the National Rifle Association, first in Florida and then across the country, state legislators have pushed for expanding the right to use deadly force. Twenty-one states have laws giving citizens wide latitude to use deadly force without first attempting to retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are some states where &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; was recently passed or is up for debate:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l A bill passed by the legislature in Minnesota was just vetoed by Gov. Mark Dayton (D).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l In Pennsylvania, former governor Ed Rendell (D) vetoed a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; bill; it was signed last year by Gov. Tom Corbett (R).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l Democratic lawmakers staged a walkout in Iowa recently to avoid a vote on the legislation. It will probably be blocked on procedural grounds this year, but state Rep. Matt Windschitl (R) plans to reintroduce it next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I anticipate that there are some people who are going to try use this unfortunate incident as an excuse not to expand Iowans' right to self-defense,&quot; Windschitl said, but argued that this case should be balanced against the lives saved by laws like the one in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l In New Hampshire last fall, Republicans in the state legislature overrode a veto from Gov. John Lynch (D) in order to pass a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think if we end up with more moderate Republicans and certainly more Democrats&quot; after the 2012 elections, &quot;it could be on the table again,&quot; said state Rep. Christopher Serlin (D).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l In Alaska, legislation has passed the House and is being considered by the state Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not every &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, however, came from a Republican-controlled state government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oklahoma's Democratic governor signed one in 2006, as part of the first wave of &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; success. So did Homeland Security Chief Janet Napolitano, when she was the Democratic governor of Arizona. In Alabama, a bill identical to Florida's was first introduced by a Democrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, however, there is a partisan divide - particularly in the past two years as advocates have attempted to bring the legislation to less-conservative states - with Republicans supporting the bills and Democrats opposing them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In states where the policy has yet to become law, supporters will likely find new resistance. In states where it has recently become law, its supporters could face a backlash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; argue that it doesn't apply in this case and does not protect killers who did not act in true self-defense. (Republican presidential candidates Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have also suggested that the law does not apply.) Opponents say the law encourages vigilante justice by creating ambiguity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've never thought by itself that the law is the main issue,&quot; said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. &quot;What we think is the main issue is the mentality that that law provides.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday several hundred people rallied at Daley Plaza, demanding justice for Trayvon, who was shot to death while walking to his father's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His killer, 28-year-old George Zimmerman, was never arrested or charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claims the shooting was in self defense, and that therefore he is protected from prosecution by Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoodies, Skittles and cans of iced tea have become symbols of support for Trayvon and his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Pfleger asked churches around the country to place the items atop their altars during Sunday mass.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 25--YORK, Pa. -- He reminded Narissa Knight of boys she sees everyday, passing by her home en route to nearby William Penn Senior High School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wasn't from York, but he could have been, she said, standing next to friend Corrie Orr, who carried a handmade cardboard sign reading &quot;Hoodie. Skittles. Iced Tea. Black. Do I match the profile?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, was wearing a hooded sweatshirt Feb. 26 when he was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida after a trip to a convenience store. He was unarmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The volunteer, George Zimmerman, told police he shot the black teenager in self-defense -- a claim that has fueled demonstrations nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm outraged for (Martin's) family -- that they had to go through this,&quot; said Elisha Brantley, another York resident standing with Orr and Knight at an anti-violence rally Saturday at the York County Judicial Center. &quot;There's no way to make it right. A little boy is gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knight allows her 12-year-old daughter to walk to the corner store by herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope we're a nation where you can do that and know your child will come home,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Brantley, she's a bit more cautious when it comes to letting her three children -- two boys and a girl -- out of sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone thinks I'm hard,&quot; she said, &quot;but I'd much rather have my kids than a body bag if I let them run to the store.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three women stood among more than 200 people who, despite the Saturday afternoon downpour, met at spots around the city before converging on the courthouse steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, people get shot and killed in the rain, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And their funerals are held rain or shine, one presenter pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not just about blacks,&quot; said the Rev. Frank Hawkins of Maranatha Church in York. &quot;It's about all the violence going on. There's been a lot of killings here in the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diana Lee and her 14-year-old son, Mykel, drove from Dallastown to support the cause. In the car, family conversation focused Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's slaying, more than 1,000 miles south of York County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Self-defense isn't violence,&quot; Diana Lee said. &quot;Violence is when you purposely hurt somebody or kill somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some reports suggest Martin and Zimmerman engaged in an altercation before the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just think that guy is somewhat like an idiot,&quot; Mykel Lee said. &quot;He was never registered as a neighborhood watchman. . . . If someone takes a swing at you, you don't take out a gun and shoot them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others didn't seem so sure about the shooting, now under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you go by what's being told, you would think that (Zimmerman) is wrong -- that he had no reason to do what he did,&quot; said James Mosely of Manchester Township. &quot;But both sides still need to be told.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elmer Speer, pastor at Manor Baptist Church in York, favors Pennsylvania's Castle Doctrine. The bill, which became law last year, eliminates a requirement that a person retreat or find a safe place before resorting to deadly force outside the home.&quot;I don't want to go back to the Wild West,&quot; he said, &quot;but historically, there were less killings then than there are now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes there's more to be told about Zimmerman's motive in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He may have very well overstepped his bounds,&quot; Speer added. &quot;But it's a difficult thing. There's violence within the law and without the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Florida police chief who has been bitterly criticised for not arresting a neighborhood watch volunteer in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager temporarily stepped down yesterday, saying he had become a distraction to the investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee and his officers decided not to arrest George Zimmerman after he shot 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin to death on February 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was returning from a trip to a convenience store when Zimmerman started following him, telling police dispatchers he looked suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At some point, the two got into a fight and Zimmerman pulled out his gun. Zimmerman claims the shooting was self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told police 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin attacked him after he had given up on chasing the teenager and was returning to his sport utility vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting ignited racial tensions in this Orlando suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights groups have held rallies in Florida and New York, saying the shooting was unjustified. Yesterday, city commissioners gave the police chief a ``no confidence'' vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I must temporarily remove myself from the position as police chief for the city of Sanford. I do this in the hopes of restoring some semblance of calm to a city which has been in turmoil for several weeks,'' Lee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``It is my hope that the investigation will move forward swiftly and appropriately through the justice system.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief has said authorities were prohibited from making an arrest based on the facts and circumstances they had at the time of the shooting. He said he continued to stand behind his agency's investigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'd had &quot;the talk&quot; before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now I had another reason to have the father-son chat: The fatal shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old black boy in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miles had heard snippets about the tragedy, which occurred in a Florida town 30 miles from where he was born. He knew that Trayvon, wearing a hoodie and packing a cellphone, a bag of Skittles and an Arizona tea, had been unarmed. He learned that the shooter, George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, had claimed self-defense and remains free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This tragic incident is a parent's nightmare. It cuts deeper, though, and its sting lingers for parents who aim to protect, insulate and prepare their sons for a reality they must shoulder:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being a young black man in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So &quot;the talk&quot; focuses on survival. Dads, especially, pass on a healthy paranoia steeped in practicality, designed as a lifesaver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the kinds of things we impress upon sons: Be aware of your surroundings. Keep your hands in full view when approached by police. &quot;Yes sir&quot; and &quot;No sir&quot; answers are givens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Know situations will arise in which you're treated suspiciously, with skepticism, simply because you're young, black and male. Accept the fact that, for some, your color will trigger the worst stereotypical imagery, some of which your peers sadly personify and perfect. Thief. Carjacker. Home invader. A menace to society warranting extermination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Understand these things fathers preach. Carry yourself with confidence, above reproach. Be smart. Watch your back. Don't press to have the last word. Avoid dust-ups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes before the talk ends, dads might share personal stories of their younger days, before the hair grayed. How, when we were teen drivers, cops would occasionally follow us and sometimes stop us. How occupants in a passing car might yell the n-word. How high school players on an opposing team might utter that same word under their breath to mess with our psyches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while these experiences aren't societal norms, they occur. They happen enough to give the impression that ignorance and hate thrive in the 21st century. And yes, it's a double-edged sword.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin tragedy has ignited a national debate on racism, self-defense and relationships between blacks and police. Then there are the self-defense laws in Florida and Georgia that say a person being attacked has no duty to retreat before opening fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laws such as these render &quot;the talk&quot; vital. White boys who wear hoodies and eat Skittles don't routinely get shot to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black boys do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have to let our young men know they are Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he has been silenced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her sons were 12 and 8 when Marlyn Tillman realized it was time for her to have the talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buying a water gun was perfectly acceptable for their white friends, but not them. As young African-American men, she told them, even owning a water gun could make them an easy target for police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I could no longer keep them in the dark,&quot; Tillman said. &quot;I had to break it to them that the world sees them differently.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All parents live in fear of anything happening to their children, but parents of black teens have an added fear. According to a 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, homicide was the leading cause of death for black males ages 12-19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the weeks since young Trayvon Martin was killed in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., those truths have weighed heavily on black parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While various circumstances contribute to the CDC's findings, parents have to teach their children how to navigate a complex landscape to avoid adding to that statistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tillman, a community activist and empty nester, lives in a middle-class, predominately white Snellville neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruben Brown, 48, lives with his wife and 14-year-old son in Atlanta and, while not the suburbs, it is hardly the 'hood. But like Tillman, he knows their middle-class status in no way equals safety when it comes to his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although worries about the safety of adolescents are not the province of just black families or parents of boys, Tillman, Brown and other parents say raising black boys is perhaps the most stressful aspects of parenting because they know they're dealing with a society that is fearful and hostile toward them, simply because of the color of their skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't believe it? Walk a day in my shoes,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown said his son, at 14, is at that critical age when he's always worried about his safety because of profiling. &quot;I don't want to scare him or have him paint people with a broad brush, but, historically, we black males have been stigmatized as the purveyors of crime and wherever we are, we're suspect,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black parents who don't make that fact clear, he and others said, do it at their and their male children's own peril.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any African-American parent not having that conversation is being irresponsible,&quot; Brown said. &quot;I see this whole thing as an opportunity for us to speak frankly, openly and honestly about race relations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morehouse College associate professor Bryant Marks agreed, saying parents need to be vigilant in raising their boys, make them aware of how they are perceived in this country and give them the skills they need to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have the conversation about the police, tell them what to do when they are on foot or in a car,&quot; he said. &quot;That conversation needs to happen. It acknowledges the bias out there, but let them know that they can succeed in spite of all of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Walking while black'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of a family's class or education, the challenge of bringing young black males safely to adulthood must be tremendous, said Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the one hand, should they tell children to run when they are faced with suspicious and possibly dangerous circumstances such as a car following them, or should they stand still for fear that their running will be interpreted as some sort of evidence of guilt?&quot; he said. &quot;It's a horrible, horrible Catch 22 for any parent or child on the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents said the news of Martin's death not only saddened them but was a reminder of the tightrope they and their children must walk everyday just to be safe. They said they are burdened by the damaging stereotypes assigned to their children and boys in particular, that make them easy targets for discrimination in schools, in the job market and on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Audraine Jackson of Atlanta recalled launching a boycott here in 1992 against a Korean grocer who pulled a shotgun on her 18-year-old nephew and a friend fleeing a group of youths chasing them. When the teens asked the grocer to call the police, Jackson said he pulled out a double-barrel shotgun instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He yelled for them to get out, sending them back into danger,&quot; Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Jackson and the teens' parents pushed the issue, the grocer's attorney said the teens were threatening because they were wearing baseball caps backward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were able to get the owner charged with two counts of criminal assault, but it took a lot of effort,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;I am saddened that 20 years later, we are still struggling with this issue in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as Cohen is concerned, the moral of the tragedy in Sanford is &quot;walking while black --- merely being black --- still seems to be a crime in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on news reports, he said, George Zimmerman, who shot Martin, appears to have concluded that Martin was &quot;suspicious&quot; based on nothing more than his race and the fact that Martin was walking in Zimmerman's neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sadly, such assumptions are made about black youth every day,&quot; Cohen said. &quot;And they play out in a million disastrous ways in schools across the country, where black youth receive far more discipline referrals than their white counterparts for similar kinds of minor misbehavior; and in the statistics that show black youths are much more likely to be stopped by police and to be arrested than their white peers for similar offenses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marks, the 39-year-old professor, admits having to still his nerves when he sees a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been classically conditioned to have a negative response to the police,&quot; he said. &quot;I still feel like I'm prey, and when you feel like you're being hunted, it can develop a deep psychological response to the presence of police that is difficult to reverse and can lead to engaging in behaviors such as running or appearing nervous that make you look guilty of something when you have done nothing wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De-claring that &quot;if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Pres-ident Obama chose a highly personal way to join the heated national debate over the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the black teenager shot to death by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama took care to voice no opinion on the conduct of the shooter, George Zimmer-man, or any legal aspect of the case beyond a call for a thorough investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The attorney general reports to me, so I've got to be careful about my statements to make sure that we're not impairing any investigation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a rare White House moment Friday - a president identifying himself with a victim in a racially charged shooting. More broadly, it drew attention to the way young black men are seen by a predominantly white society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Zimmerman acted legally in the Feb. 26 shooting and whether the Sanford, Fla., police acted properly in declining to arrest him turn in large part on how the victim is viewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 28, has claimed he shot Martin, 17, in self-defense after he called police to say he was following a person in his gated community whom he believed was acting suspiciously. Supporters of Martin's family have said the high school student was merely walking through the neighborhood on his way to a relative's home and that nothing about him could reasonably have been considered suspicious or threatening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents appeared to acknowledge that Obama's public identification with their son carried huge symbolic importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president's personal comments touched us deeply,&quot; they said. The remarks &quot;made us wonder: If his son looked liked Trayvon and wore a hoodie, would he be suspicious, too?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Frederica Wil-son, D-Fla., who has been in close contact with the Martin family, expressed a view held by many black leaders, saying that being targeted for violence &quot;is the reality of being a black boy in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a problem that has existed for generations since slavery,&quot; she said, expressing the hope that Obama's remarks might change how black men are perceived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time the president is realistic about a situation, it helps the country grow and mature,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's comments were not written in advance, aides said, but they came after a week in which he has been closely following the case. During a trip to western states over the past two days, he read articles about the shooting and commented privately about how the teenager's family must feel, and how he would take such news if it ever came to his door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Obama called the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose mother had died that day, to express condolences. Sharpton was on his way to a rally about the case that he had helped organize. Aides said they assumed the two men talked about the shooting, though Obama did not explicitly tell them so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, the president had hesitated to speak publicly about the shooting, concerned that he would appear to be trying to affect the outcome of the case, but over the week, his view shifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He did not want to jeopardize the independent investigation,&quot; the official said, &quot;but he also felt that we need to ask ourselves how this could happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his way out to the Rose Garden on Friday morning to announce a nominee to head the World Bank, Obama told aides that he would comment on the case if asked about it - a contrast with his frequent practice of shunning questions in formal settings if they depart from the topic of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was &quot;speaking as a parent,&quot; said the official. &quot;He was very deeply troubled by the death of a very young man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments shifted the White House position, which had been to keep a distance from the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday, for example, press secretary Jay Carney had said only that &quot;we here in the White House are aware of the incident&quot; and that &quot;our thoughts and prayers go out to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family, but obviously, we're not going to wade into a local law enforcement matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, Obama said that &quot;it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pulls together -- federal, state and local -- to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened.&quot; People should &quot;examine the laws and the context for what happened, as well as the specifics of the incident,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential hopefuls joined Obama in his call for a thorough investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What happened to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is a tragedy,&quot; Mitt Romney said in a written statement. &quot;There needs to be a thorough investigation that reassures the public that justice is carried out with impartiality and integrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning at a shooting range in West Monroe, La., Rick Santorum called Martin's death a &quot;horrible case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's chilling to hear what happened,&quot; Santorum said. &quot;The fact that law enforcement didn't immediately go after and prosecute this case is another chilling example of, I would say, the horrible decisions made by the people in this case.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LENOX</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What kind of country are we living in?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apparent &quot;in cold blood&quot; murder of an innocent black teenager, minding his own business while returning from a convenience store in Sanford, Fla., reminds us of how many more miles we have to travel before achieving racial harmony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The haunting tragedy of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, gunned down by an apparently racist &quot;neighborhood watch captain,&quot; reflects the travesty of Florida's gun-crazed &quot;legal&quot; system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice must be served, although nothing can bring back the tall, sweet-faced youth who was wearing a hoodie and carrying only a snack and iced tea when confronted by George Zimmerman, 28, a white Hispanic who has been in trouble with the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of this writing, Zimmerman remains in hiding; his father contends the young man grew up in a multi-racial, multinational home (a white father, a Peruvian mother) and harbors no racial animosity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not what his 47 separate calls to 911 over the past year reflect -- the log shows multiple references to &quot;suspicious-looking&quot; blacks who had the temerity to be in the vicinity of the gated community unofficially patrolled by Zimmerman. A deleted, racist epithet from the 911 transcript in the Martin case indicates he may have been consumed by hatred of African-Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman ignored the 911 dispatcher's request to remain in his vehicle and not pursue young Trayvon, who is heard on the police tape and in a cell phone call to his girl friend crying, screaming and pleading for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truly heart-wrenching, a young life snuffed out for no reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From what we know, this is a potential hate crime and we can only hope a judge and jury will have the opportunity to sift the evidence and come back with a determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much has been written about the absurd &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; self-defense laws adopted by Florida and 20 other states that allow anyone who &quot;feels&quot; or &quot;believes&quot; he is being threatened to shoot first, ask questions later, and escape the consequences. The law reeks of the Wild West, and should be challenged up to the U.S. Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it took the national media several weeks to become interested in the Feb. 26 shooting, major credit goes to New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow, who described how Trayvon's father, who reported his son missing after he failed to return from the store, confirmed the death after police displayed a photo of the boy with blood pouring from his mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Martin had to call the boy's mom, Sybrina Fulton. &quot;He said that Troy was gone,&quot; Fulton told The Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On MSNBC, Tracy recalled how his son was &quot;my main man, my hero. He saved my life, actually pulled me out of a house fire. He was 9 years old at the time. A 9-year-old kid saved his dad's life. And I wasn't there to save his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon had been suspended from high school the day before the shooting for non-violent behavioral issues, but had no criminal record and was carrying nothing that could have been used as a weapon. Zimmerman packed a 9-mm handgun. Trayvon was defenseless during the fatal altercation. Zimmerman, quickly released from custody after brief questioning, told Sanford police he was acting in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As columnist Blow asked: Why did Zimmerman find Trayvon suspicious? Why did he pursue the boy when the 911 operator instructed him not to? Why did he get out of the car, and why did he take his gun when he did? How is it self-defense when you are the one in pursuit? Who initiated the altercation? Who cried for help? Did Trayvon's body show evidence of a struggle? What moved Zimmerman to use lethal force?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case seems all about vigilante &quot;justice&quot; and racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the father of two black teenage boys, this case hits close to home,&quot; Blow wrote. &quot;This is the fear that seizes me whenever my boys are out in the world: that a man with a gun and an itchy finger will find them 'suspicious.' That passions may run hot and blood run cold. That it might all end with a hole in their chest and a hole in my heart. That the law might prove insufficient to salve my loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is the burden of black boys in America and the people that love them: running the risk of being descended upon in the dark and caught in the cross-hairs of someone who crosses the line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama said on Friday: &quot;When I think about that boy, I think about my own kids. If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. All of us have some soul-searching to do, to figure out how something like this happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NPR's Corey Dade wrote of &quot;The Talk&quot; African-American males get when they enter their teens: &quot;I am a black man. This is one of the realities I have lived. My parents prepared me for it. To be sure, my parents taught me to transcend matters of race. However, they also gave me 'The Talk.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For other boys coming of age, parents may end it after a lecture about sex, drugs, alcohol or Internet porn. The rite for black boys often is more rigorous: We're also drilled on a set of rules designed to protect us against suspicions too often associated with the color of our skin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Americans, black, white, mixed or other, share the fear that unless and until justice is done and the outrageous &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws are overturned, the promise of America as &quot;the land of the free and the home of the brave&quot; remains just an empty slogan for too many of our citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all need to be having &quot;The Talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - Fox News Channel commentator Geraldo Rivera said Friday that the hoodie an unarmed black teenager wore when he was killed in Florida is as much responsible for his death as the man who shot him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The veteran TV personality, speaking on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends,&quot; waded in with an opinion on the shooting of Trayvon Martin. He later acknowledged that his comments were &quot;politically incorrect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People wearing hooded sweatshirts are often going to be perceived as a menace, Rivera said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll bet you money that if he didn't have that hoodie on, that nutty neighborhood watch guy wouldn't have responded in that violent and aggressive way,&quot; Rivera said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of Martin, Rivera said, &quot;God bless him, he was an innocent kid, a wonderful kid.&quot; But he said the case should be a warning to parents to watch what their children should wear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you dress like a hoodlum eventually some schmuck is going to take you at your word,&quot; he wrote in a commentary posted Friday on the website Fox News Latino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of people had posted messages on Rivera's Facebook page by Friday afternoon, the overwhelming majority of them negative about Rivera's comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one black, brown or white can honestly tell me that seeing a kid of color with a hood pulled over his head doesn't generate a certain reaction - sometimes scorn, often menace,&quot; Rivera wrote in his commentary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The furor over the Florida shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin has created a new symbol of solidarity: the humble hooded sweatshirt known as the hoodie. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBA star LeBron James tweeted the above photo of his teammates on the Miami Heat, heads bowed, all in hoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund posed in one, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point today, NPR was leading its website with a comprehensive trend story. Twitter is alive with hashtags and tweets on the subject, many of them defiant in tone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in major cities, thousands are turning out for Million Hoodie Marches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of the symbol took on new momentum Friday following Geraldo Rivera's warning on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; to teens and parents that wearing a hoodie, as Martin did when he was shot, was dangerous and sent a negative message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You cannot rehabilitate the hoodie,&quot; Rivera said. &quot;Stop wearing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some may have heeded that advice; many others found it appalling, only adding to the problem of racial stereotyping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powerful feelings of anger and injustice have found a powerful, if unpredictable, visual symbol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NPR's Linton Weeks quoted former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, who summed up well what's happening: &quot;The hoodie is a way of expressing support for the Martin family,&quot; she said,&quot;and for all the sons of African American families who bear the heavy burden of other people's negative assumptions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underbelly of racism - Page 23 The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin has reignited the debate over race in the United States as thousands of protesters took to streets across the country and black members of Congress accused the Sanford Police Department of a &quot;blatant disregard for justice&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 17-year-old was killed by George Zimmerman, a volunteer warden, as he returned from the shops carrying a packet of Skittles and a can of iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, a mixed race Hispanic, said he opened fire in self-defence after the teenager attacked him but growing evidence from witnesses and 911 tapes suggests that the older man chased him through the gated housing estate where his father lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of national outrage, Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee last night said he was temporarily stepping aside &quot;to restore some semblance of calm to the city which has been in turmoil for several weeks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lee said he stood by his officers' decision not to arrest of charge Mr Zimmerman, 28, but admitted he had become &quot;a distraction&quot; in the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have repeatedly said that under Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which entitles citizens to use lethal force if they are in fear of grievous bodily harm, they had no grounds to move against Mr Zimmerman. Mr Martin's family claim that detectives decided to allow Mr Zimmerman to return home just hours after the killing because the victim was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking last night before a rally organised with civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton Mr Martin's father Tracy said the chief's resignation was not enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This temporary step down of Bill Lee is nothing,&quot; he told a large, chanting crowd in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want an arrest, we want a conviction and we want a sentence for the murder of our son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of those gathered at the rally held placards reading, &quot;No more lynching&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Mr Martin and other family members met officials from the Department of Justice who have opened a federal investigation into the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state attorney, whose office took control of the local investigation from Sanford police, said a grand jury would be convened on April 10 to decide what, if any, charges should be brought against Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation now centres around Mr Zimmerman's call to police after spotting Mr Martin on the night of February 26 and an account by the teenager's girlfriend, who was on the phone to him shortly before his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman told an operator that Mr Martin seemed &quot;up to no good, or he's on drugs&quot; and appears to have pursued him even when police told him that was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Mr Martin attacked him from behind.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) - LeBron James had 17 points and 10 assists to lead the Miami Heat to their fourth straight victory, 88-73 over the Detroit Pistons on Friday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dwyane Wade added 24 points for the Heat, who posed for a photo earlier in the day wearing team-logo hoodies. Players were speaking out following the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed black teenager wearing a hooded sweatshirt who was shot by a neighborhood crime-watch volunteer last month in a suburb of Orlando, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Heat players, including Wade and James, took the floor with messages such as &quot;RIP Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot; and &quot;We want justice&quot; scrawled on their sneakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brandon Knight scored 18 points for the Pistons, who have lost five of six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wade posted a photo of himself from a previous photo shoot wearing a hooded shirt, otherwise known as a hoodie, to his Twitter and Facebook pages on Friday morning. A couple hours later, James posted another photo - this one of 13 Heat players, all wearing team-logo hoodies, their heads bowed, their hands stuffed into their pockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was killed as he was returning to a gated community, carrying candy and iced tea. A neighborhood crime-watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, said he acted in self-defense. He has not been arrested, though state and federal authorities are still investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests have popped up nationwide in recent days, with thousands of people - many of them wearing hoodies - calling for action. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra called the team photo &quot;a powerful move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the game started, the Heat made quick work of the Pistons. Miami led by 26 in the third quarter, although Detroit did rally to make it respectable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detroit trailed 72-57 after three and cut the deficit to single digits early in the fourth. After Jonas Jerebko's reverse dunk on a breakaway made it 74-65, the Heat took a timeout with 8:58 to play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wade made a floater to start a 10-2 run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detroit was without guard Rodney Stuckey, out with a sore left big toe. Ben Gordon, who made all nine of his 3-point attempts in a 45-point effort at Denver on Wednesday night, went 0 for 4 from beyond the arc and scored 10 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami's Joel Anthony returned to the lineup after missing Tuesday's win over Phoenix with a sprained left ankle. He scored six points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Heat shot 57 percent in the first half and finished the second quarter strong. Wade's layup off a pass from James with 4.3 seconds remaining made it 59-36, and Chris Bosh blocked Will Bynum's attempt at a driving layup at the other end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James intercepted a pass near midcourt in the third quarter and found Wade alone downcourt for an alley-oop dunk. Mario Chalmers then sank a 3-pointer to make it 70-44.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOTES: Knight now holds Detroit's rookie record for 3-pointers after making four Friday for a season total of 73. Lindsey Hunter made 69 in 1993-94. ... Miami's Mike Miller remained out with a sprained left ankle. ... Wade missed a streaking James in the fourth quarter on an alley-oop attempt when James was unable to handle a high pass.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TORONTO (AP) - DeMar DeRozan scored 30 points before leaving with an injury, Andrea Bargnani had 21 and the Toronto Raptors routed the Knicks 96-79 Friday night, snapping New York's five-game winning streak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Raptors, who had lost seven of 10 coming in, never trailed and led by as many as 22. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Forbes scored 19 points, one shy of his career-high, and Jose Calderon had 10 assists as Toronto snapped a three-game skid and handed New York its first defeat under coach Mike Woodson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the win may have come at a high price for Toronto as DeRozan fell hard after a collision with Calderon with 2:59 left, got up and hobbled straight to the locker room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amare Stoudemire scored 17 points, Steve Novak had 15 and Carmelo Anthony 12 for the Knicks, who came in having won six of seven against the Raptors, including three straight in Toronto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Lin made a game-winning 3-pointer on New York's last visit to Toronto, a 90-87 victory on Feb. 14, but was held in check this time, finishing with six points. Hundreds of fans cheered Lin with signs and Taiwanese flags, but many in the crowd booed whenever he touched the ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trailing by 17 points to start the fourth, the Knicks opened with a 7-0 run, including a three-point play by J.R. Smith and a 3 from Novak. Forbes stopped the run with a pair of baskets before Novak added another 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Knicks would score just one basket in the next four minutes as Toronto surged ahead. Bargnani and DeRozan had consecutive dunks, forcing a New York timeout. After the stoppage, DeRozan dunked off Forbes' alley-oop off the glass before Forbes forced a steal and drove in for a layup, making it 86-65 with 4:54 left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tempers nearly flared in the first after Bargnani leveled Lin with a screen and Anthony responded by hauling down Calderon on a drive to the basket. Calderon got up yelling, and Raptors center Aaron Gray gave Anthony a hard shove. Both Gray and Anthony got technicals, while Bargnani was whistled for an offensive foul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bargnani and DeRozan each scored nine in the first and Anthony shot just 2 for 7 as Toronto led 25-16 after one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Novak hit a 3 at the halftime buzzer but the Raptors, who did not trail in the first two quarters, took a 39-36 lead into the locker room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DeRozan scored 14 points in the third, two on an impressive alley-oop from James Johnson and two more on a rebound and jumper with less than two seconds left, as the Raptors took a 70-53 lead into the fourth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOTES: Stoudemire wore a gray hoodie during early warmups as a sign of support for the family of Florida shooting victim Trayvon Martin. ... Knicks F Jared Jeffries, who left Wednesday's win at Philadelphia with a sore left knee, is expected to undergo an MRI Saturday morning, and will likely miss that evening's game against Detroit. ... Raptors G Jerryd Bayless (left hip) did not play and is likely to miss Saturday's game at Chicago, coach Dwane Casey said. ... Toronto waived F Rasual Butler earlier Friday. Butler had not played in eight games. ... For the first time in franchise history, a Raptors game was broadcast in Mandarin. Former Chinese Olympic basketball player Weiping Zhang handled play-by-play duties for the national broadcast on OMNI, a Canadian multicultural station.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WEST MONROE, La. (AP) - Facing heightened pressure to revive his presidential bid, Rick Santorum was forced to explain another apparent misstep as he courted Louisiana voters Friday, the eve of a critical contest in a Republican nomination battle that increasingly favors Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santorum said he would support the eventual GOP nominee - if it isn't him - despite what he insists are similarities between front-runner Romney and President Barack Obama that make them indistinguishable on some issues. He caused an intraparty uproar earlier in the week after suggesting he'd prefer a second term for Obama over a Romney presidency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've said repeatedly and will continue to say, I'll vote for whoever the Republican nominee is and I will work for him,&quot; Santorum said as he walked back his original comments less than 24 hours before Louisiana polls were set to open. &quot;Barack Obama is a disaster, but we can't have someone who agrees with him on some of the biggest issues of the day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation underscored Santorum's challenges ahead of a Louisiana contest he's favored to win. Santorum has had success in the South, having won last week's contests in Alabama and Mississippi. Regardless of the outcome today, however, Romney will have collected more delegates than his opponents combined as the race then turns to more favorable territory in the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santorum's continued missteps are complicating a candidacy already struggling to overcome major financial and organizational deficiencies. Before losing this week's Illinois primary, Santorum hurt himself by declaring that neither the economy nor the nation's unemployment rate was his top concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the biggest development of the last 24 hours was Sen. Santorum's remarkable mistake in suggesting that re-electing President Obama was acceptable under any circumstance,&quot; Republican contender Newt Gingrich told reporters in Port Fourchon, La. &quot;I just want to make very clear that I could not disagree with him more strongly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as his GOP opponents fought amongst themselves, Romney went after Obama on the second anniversary of his landmark health-care law, previewing a key argument in a potential general election matchup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing in front of signs that read, &quot;Repeal &amp; Replace ObamaCare,&quot; as he campaigned in Louisiana, Romney called Obama's signature health care law an &quot;an unfolding disaster for the American economy, a budget-busting entitlement and a dramatic new federal intrusion into our lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In attacking the law days before Supreme Court arguments over its constitutionality, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination also confronted an issue that has plagued him throughout the GOP primary process. As governor of Massachusetts, Romney signed a health care law that required everyone in the state to carry health insurance or pay a penalty. It's a state version of the national mandate that is the centerpiece of Obama's overhaul - an idea that conservatives oppose as an example of government overreach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's steadfast support for the mandate at the state level has fueled continued conservative skepticism about his candidacy. And his attack on Obama's overhaul caught the attention of White House spokesman Jay Carney, who said Friday that the president would &quot;not shy away from the opportunity to debate&quot; the bill, particularly given Romney's background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That debate will be engaged in the fall if the Republican nominee feels so strongly about it,&quot; Carney said, referring to Romney as &quot;one of the architects of this health care reform.&quot; ''As many have noted in both parties, the individual mandate provision of the president's Affordable Care Act bears striking similarities to the individual mandate that was put in place in Massachusetts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Obama catapulted the death in Florida of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, already the focus of major national attention, into the presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santorum was critical of local prosecutors, who declined to arrest the shooter, George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watchman who claimed self-defense and invoked Florida's' &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law. The law gives people wide latitude to use deadly force instead of retreating during a fight and explains why Zimmerman has not been arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failure to prosecute is a &quot;chilling example of the horrible decisions made by people in this process,&quot; Santorum said. &quot;Stand your ground is not doing what this man did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gingrich also criticized the shooter, whom he described as &quot;a guy who'd found a hobby that's very dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, like Obama, called the incident &quot;a tragedy,&quot; and called for &quot;a thorough investigation that reassures the public that justice is carried out with impartiality and integrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While attention to Martin's death overshadowed presidential politics at times Friday, Santorum tried to keep the pressure on Romney ahead of the Louisiana contest. Santorum argued that he is the only Republican candidate who can offer voters a stark contrast with Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After testing his marksmanship with a .45 caliber semiautomatic Colt pistol, he told reporters: &quot;If you don't have a choice, then a lot of voters are going to vote for what they have. That's why we have to have a choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney heads into Louisiana with a commanding delegate lead in the race to 1,144, the number needed to clinch the GOP nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has earned 563 delegates so far, compared to 263 for Santorum, 135 for Gingrich and 50 for Ron Paul, according to an Associated Press tally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louisiana offers a total of 46 delegates, but only 20 will be up for grabs in Saturday's primary. An additional 23 will be selected at the party's state convention in June and three others go to the state's Republican National Committee members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while Santorum tried to recover from one misstep, a supporter in the audience added an off-message wrinkle. As he fired the pistol, a woman in the crowd shouted: &quot;Pretend it's Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santorum was wearing protective ear muffs. He said later that he didn't hear the remark but denounced it as &quot;absurd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secret Service, which provides security for Santorum, was trying to identify the woman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama spoke in unusually personal terms Friday about the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager in Florida, a case that has roiled civil rights activists and a suburban Orlando community. &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said, vowing to &quot;get to the bottom of what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama expressed sympathy for the parents of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, who was shot on Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla., a suburb of Orlando, by a neighborhood watch volunteer who said he was acting in self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can only imagine what these parents are going through, and when I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,&quot; Obama said, calling the case a &quot;tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's first black president aimed his message at Martin's parents, saying, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans take this with the seriousness that it deserves, and we're going to get to the bottom of what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said that &quot;every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this and everybody pulls together, federal state and local, to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama brought his voice to an issue that is sensitive in Florida, a large and diverse state that plays an influential role in presidential elections. The Orlando area in central Florida is particularly important, acting as a bellwether for statewide elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidates weighed in after Obama spoke. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum called the shooting &quot;horrible case&quot; and referred to Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which gives people wide latitude to use deadly force rather than retreat during a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santorum said: &quot;Stand your ground is not doing what this man did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney issued a statement after Obama spoke that read: &quot;What happened to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is a tragedy. There needs to be a thorough investigation that reassures the public that justice is carried out with impartiality and integrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department and FBI have opened a civil rights investigation, and a grand jury is considering whether to charge George Zimmerman, who acknowledged shooting the teen but said it was in self-defense. Martin's parents, civil rights activists and others who have rallied to the cause say they won't be satisfied until Zimmerman is arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Chief Bill Lee stepped down temporarily this week to try to cool the building anger that his department had not arrested Zimmerman. Hours later, Gov. Rick Scott announced that the local state attorney, Norman Wolfinger, had recused himself from the case in hopes of &quot;toning down the rhetoric&quot; surrounding it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was returning from a trip to a convenience store when Zimmerman started following him, telling police dispatchers he looked suspicious. At some point, the two got into a fight, and Zimmerman pulled out his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told police Martin attacked him after he had given up on chasing the teenager and was returning to his sport utility vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama cautioned before speaking that he must &quot;be careful so we're not impairing any investigation.&quot; But he said he was glad the Justice Department was investigating and that Florida officials had formed the task force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think all of us have to do some soul searching to figure out how did something like this happen, and that means we examine the laws and the context for what happened as well as the specifics of the incident,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case resonates with many black Americans, a key voting group during Obama's 2008 election, who see it as yet another example of bias toward blacks. Civil rights groups have held rallies in Florida and New York, saying the shooting was unjustified. Of Sanford's 53,000 residents, 57 percent are white and 30 percent are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama himself has tried to downplay race, as he did early in his term after the controversial arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr., a black Harvard University professor, by a white police sergeant in Cambridge, Mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gates was arrested in his own home after the police sergeant arrived to investigate a possible burglary. The charges were dropped, but Obama said the police had &quot;acted stupidly,&quot; breathing life into a lingering debate. The president said later he should have expressed his concerns with different language and invited both Gates and Sgt. James Crowley to the White House for a beer.</SPAN></P>

Is he a vigilante or, as one neighbor said, 'a good dude'?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrik Jonsson Staff writer</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1197 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, the 28-year-old former altar boy whose shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager, has caused a national uproar, has withdrawn into seclusion. His lawyer says he's afraid for his life amid numerous death threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Florida and federal investigators dig into the Feb. 26 shooting and the Sanford Police Department's decision to not charge Zimmerman with a crime, attempts to understand the shooting have focused on the extent to which Zimmerman's past experiences colored his decisions in the moments before Trayvon died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics have called Zimmerman a racist vigilante who initiated a conflict with Trayvon largely because of a profile: A black man wearing a hoodie walking through a gated neighborhood. If the FBI finds evidence of this, Zimmerman could be charged with a federal hate crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A separate state investigation is slated to probe whether the state's Stand Your Ground law, the justification for not charging Zimmerman, was applied properly amid new evidence that suggests Zimmerman followed Trayvon and initiated an altercation where Trayvon got the upper hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gun nation: Inside America's gun-carry culture</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's comments on a 911 tape from the night of the shooting that &quot;These [expletive] always get away,&quot; and speculation about whether he uttered a racial slur before following Trayvon on foot support the idea that Zimmerman's frustration with a crime wave in the Retreat at Twin Lakes had boiled over into vigilantism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has contended that he was on his way back to his SUV after following Trayvon when he was attacked. Police found Zimmerman with a bloody nose and blood on the back of his head. His lawyer says Zimmerman's nose was broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the very least, a series of 46 emergency calls made by Zimmerman over the past six years document a man vigilant about keeping his neighborhood safe and orderly. The calls include complaints about unruly people at the pool, potholes, dumped trash, and kids playing in the street. In recent months, as the neighborhood saw an uptick in crime, including burglaries and a shooting, Zimmerman's calls had focused on specific suspects, the majority of them young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The newly released police calls paint Zimmerman as a man obsessed with law and order, with the minutiae of suburban life, and with black males,&quot; writes Mother Jones' Adam Weinstein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zimmerman's family, his neighbors and his lawyer paint a different picture: That of a devoted neighbor, keen enough to protect the neighborhood that residents, in establishing a local Neighborhood Watch group last year, appointed him the captain. The organization was not registered with the national Neighborhood Watch program, but was set up with the assistance of the Sanford Police Department. Zimmerman initiated the program, according to Wendy Dorival, the department's volunteer coordinator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frank Taaffe, a neighbor, told CNN that Zimmerman &quot;had a passion for the safety of our neighborhood and he demonstrated to the rest of us that one person could make a difference. And he was an average guy, just like me.&quot; In a separate interview, Mr. Taaffe told the Washington Post, &quot;George is a good dude. He cares about this community. He's not a vigilante out looking for trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman grew up in Manassas, Va., the son of a white father and a Latina mother. He attended a Catholic church, where he was an altar boy. In high school, he was the victim of an assault. He moved to Florida a decade ago, writing in his high school yearbook, &quot;I'm going to Florida to work with my godfather who just bought a $1 million business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2005, when he was 21, he was charged with assault on a police officer during an altercation over the arrest of one of his friends for underage drinking in a bar, but he chose a common route for first-time offenders: A pre-trial diversion that allowed him to escape a felony conviction. Such a conviction could have precluded him from having the permit that allowed him to carry the 9 mm gun used to shoot Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Zimmerman was not acting outside the legal boundaries of Florida Statute by carrying his weapon when this incident occurred,&quot; Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee said recently. &quot;He was in fact on a personal errand in his vehicle when he observed Mr. Martin in the community and called the Sanford Police Department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief has also said Zimmerman had no legal duty to heed a dispatcher's warning to stay put instead of following Trayvon on foot. (Chief Lee stepped down &quot;temporarily&quot; this week after receiving a no-confidence vote from the Sanford City Council over his handling of the case.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in 2005, his then-fianc&eacute;e accused Zimmerman of domestic violence when she filed a court injunction against him. He responded with an injunction of his own. Their court battled ended when the injunctions expired in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having worked in the past as a car salesman, Zimmerman became interested in becoming a police officer. In 2008, he attended a four-month course at the local sheriff's department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his application for the course, Zimmerman wrote: &quot;I hold law enforcement officers in the highest regard and I hope to one day become one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, he was taking law enforcement courses at Seminole State College, where he had earlier studied to become an insurance agent. After the shooting, the college said it had &quot;taken the unusual but necessary step ... to withdraw&quot; Zimmerman from the campus, citing concerns about safety for Zimmerman and other students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Zimmerman was known to local police has deepened suspicion that prosecutors overlooked key facts in determining that Zimmerman had a legitimate claim of self-defense under Florida's landmark Stand Your Ground law, which allows the use of deadly force and obviates any need by a citizen to retreat if they reasonably fear for their life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reality is that this chief had probable cause to lock up a man who shot a boy in cold blood - because he shot a boy in cold blood - and he failed to do that,&quot; NAACP President Ben Jealous said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's the specter of racial injustice and suspicions about Zimmerman's views on race that have sparked dozens of protests around the country and drawn international attention to Trayvon's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's father, a retired magistrate judge, fought back against those allegations in a recent letter to the Orlando Sentinel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The portrayal of George Zimmerman in the media, as well as the series of events that led to the tragic shooting, are false and extremely misleading,&quot; Robert Zimmerman wrote. &quot;Unfortunately, some individuals and organizations have used this tragedy to further their own causes and agendas. George is a Spanish-speaking minority with many black family members and friends. He would be the last to discriminate for any reason whatsoever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview Friday, Zimmerman's lawyer, Craig Sonner, told CNN that Zimmerman had recently mentored a black boy, taking him out to play basketball and participating in fund-raisers at the boy's church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a case about self-defense, that's what the trial is going to be about,&quot; Mr. Sonner said. &quot;It's not about being angry over a racial issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boy's parents &quot;are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves,&quot; the President said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was gunned down Feb. 26 in a suburb of Orlando, Fla., while walking back to his father's house carrying nothing more lethal than an iced tea and a bag of Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 140-pound teen was killed by George Zimmerman, a self-appointed neighborhood watchman who claimed that he only fired in self-defense after the 17-year-old jumped him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 28, said he became suspicious of Martin because the young man was wearing a hooded sweatshirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of the high school student caused a nationwide uproar that intensified when the shooter was released without any criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents issued a statement Friday thanking the President for his support in their time of suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's words &quot;touched us deeply and made us wonder: If his son looked like Trayvon and wore a hoodie, would he be suspicious too?&quot; asked Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign of support for Trayvon, Knicks center Amar'e Stoudemire wore a hoodie for a portion of pregame warmups Friday, and NBA superstar LeBron James tweeted a photo of the Miami Heat all wearing hoodies with the hashtag #WeAreTrayvonMartin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesman Jay Carney said it was unclear if the President planned to contact the parents directly about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have any information in that regard,&quot; he told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, carefully choosing his words to avoid any interference with the investigation, expressed his support for a Justice Department and FBI civil rights probe of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida grand jury is also considering charges against Zimmerman in the slaying that forced the local police chief to temporarily step down and the local prosecutor to recuse himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think all of us have to do some soul-searching to figure out how does something like this happen,&quot; the commander in chief said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And that means we examine the laws, the context for what happened, as well as the specifics of the incident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President's GOP challengers echoed his call, with Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich all bemoaning the tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a point in there where there ought to be some kind of signal that it's pretty clear that this is a guy who found a hobby that's very dangerous,&quot; Gingrich said referring to Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was with deft, heartfelt emotion that President Obama spoke Friday about the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said, speaking as any father might of the senseless killing of an unarmed teenager while also expressing the perspective of America's first black President. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did so without passing premature judgment on the question of whether self-appointed vigilante George Zimmerman suspected Trayvon of being up to no good and then shot him because of the color of his skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, in noting his bond of appearance with Trayvon, Obama tapped into the raw nerve the killing has touched among black Americans who are all too aware of the country's history of unpunished, racially motivated slayings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amplifying the outrage was the fact that local cops initially let Zimmerman go without conducting a full inquiry because, as they explained it, they read Florida's insane Stand Your Ground Law to sanction his action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the glare of national attention, the local police chief in Sanford, Fla., has stepped aside, the state is reconsidering the wisdom of its law and the Justice Department and local authorities are conducting full-scale investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was limited in what he could responsibly say regarding Zimmerman's guilt or innocence, but he did not shy away from the wrenching emotional realities:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can only imagine what these parents are going throug</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">h. And when I think about this boy, I think about my own kids. And I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pulls together - federal, state and local - to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All undeniably correct, all powerfully unifying. Indeed, across the political spectrum, there has been a remarkably consistent recognition of the horrible wrong committed by Zimmerman, as well as the issues of race that overshadow the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leading Republican contender for President on Friday strongly condemned the shooting, echoing Obama's words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Mitt Romney: &quot;What happened to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is a tragedy. There needs to be a thorough investigation that reassures the public that justice is carried out with impartiality and integrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When that investigation brings answers, the heartache will begin to subside.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT Barack Obama weighed into the growing furore over the shooting of the black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin yesterday, using his experiences as a black parent to call for a thorough investigation into the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,&quot; Mr Obama said, in his first words on an incident that has reignited the debate on race relations in America. &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of 17-year-old Trayvon last month has led to outrage across America after his killer, George Zimmerman, used controversial self-defence laws to avoid prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama, who as America's first black president has always shown a reluctance to play the &quot;race&quot; card, pointedly sent his sympathies to the Martin family, describing the killing as a &quot;tragedy&quot; that should lead to national &quot;soul searching&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My main message is to the parents of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Mr Obama said. &quot;And I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves and that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was killed in Sanford, Florida, as he returned from a store where he had bought a packet of sweets. Mr Zimmerman had a history of calling police to his mainly-white gated community, and when he dialled the emergency services he claimed that he had seen a suspicious person who was &quot;probably on drugs&quot;. Police told him not to follow the suspect, but Mr Zimmerman did not obey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A girlfriend who was on the phone to Trayvon - who was wearing a hoodie - claims she heard him being shoved to the ground. Neighbours heard screams for help before a shot rang out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama signalled the need for further debate about Florida's Republican-backed and hugely permissive &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; gun laws, which have seen the number of &quot;justifiable homicides&quot; from self-defence shootings almost triple since it was introduced in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as the president was speaking, protests were growing over the failure of police to arrest Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Miami, hundreds of schoolchildren walked out of classes in protest, chanting: &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; An online petition has attracted nearly 1.5million signatures. Protesters say it was unacceptable for Mr Zimmerman to attack an unarmed teenager he had been told by police not to follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his remarks, Mr Obama appeared to suggest that &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; should be reviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative to investigate every aspect of this and that everybody pulls together - federal, state and local - to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened,&quot; he said. &quot;I think all of us have to do some soul searching to figure out how does something like this happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And that means we examine the laws, the context for what happened, as well as the specifics of the incident.&quot; Mr Zimmerman's whereabouts is unknown. His father has denied that he is racist, and says that Mr Zimmerman's mother is Hispanic, and so he is also of an ethnic minority background.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BARACK Obama stepped into the controversy over the shooting of an unarmed black teenager last night amid fears the killing could cause race riots across America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black leaders demanded justice as angry protests by thousands of demonstrators threatened to boil over into violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, was shot dead by an overzealous neighbourhood watch volunteer when he went out to buy a bag of Skittles near his Florida home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the shooting happened nearly a month ago, the Hispanic gunman is still free, claiming he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton and the teenager's family have led demands for the arrest of 28-year-old amateur lawman George Zimmerman, claiming the killing was racially motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an attempt to defuse the tension, the President made an emotional plea for America to do some 'soul searching' over the tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,' said Mr Obama, a father of two daughters, Malia, 13, and Sasha, ten. He spoke out after coming under attack from some black leaders for failing to comment on a case that had been dominating the U.S. news for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,' said Mr Obama at the White House. 'Every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pull together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Obviously this is a tragedy. I can only imagine what these parents are going through. All of us have to do some soul searching to figure out how something like this has happened.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students in at least eight Florida schools walked out in protest yesterday and more demonstrations are planned around the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the embattled police chief in Sanford, Florida, where the shooting happened, stepped down because of the widespread condemnation of his failure to arrest Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move did little to mollify a crowd of thousands at a rally held later in the Orlando suburb. Mr Sharpton, standing with Trayvon's parents, told the crowd: 'We want George Zimmerman in court with handcuffs behind his back.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford police chief Bill Lee insisted there was no evidence to arrest Zimmerman, who claimed he was forced to shoot in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was heard on a police radio dispatcher's tape saying he was following the teenager on February 26. 'This guy looks like he's up to no good . . . these ****holes always get away,' he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON The nation's difficult history with race relations has been central to the narrative of Barack Obama's rise to the presidency and has often complicated the ways in which he deals with the issue both as a candidate and as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the president's decision Friday to assertively insert himself into the controversy surrounding the fatal shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a black Florida 17-year-old, is evidence of Obama's evolution and rising comfort level in dealing with the matter of race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new approach is at once deeply personal and completely universal, and avoids taking sides in a political fight. His appeal Friday was to the parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can only imagine what these parents are going through,&quot; he said. &quot;And I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pulls together -- federal, state and local -- to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embedded in his remarks in the Rose Garden was a particular message about being a black parent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said. &quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions expected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House officials almost certainly knew Obama would be asked about the Martin shooting soon. The case has stirred immense passion nationwide because of its racial element: Martin was killed by George Zimmerman, 28, a Latino neighborhood-watch volunteer, who claimed self-defense. Zimmerman has not been charged in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama did not deal with the details of the incident. He discussed the racially charged incident without saying the words &quot;black&quot; or &quot;race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His remarks followed the announcement of his pick to lead the World Bank, not a time when he usually takes questions, but clearly he was ready for one. It was not certain earlier that Obama would get involved in the controversy. It is the kind of issue that Obama and his aides have bungled in the past. But on Friday, even Republicans running for president followed him into the issue, echoing his call for a full investigation into the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House aides had said repeatedly that they had no comment, calling it a local issue that needed to work its way through the courts. When the Justice Department opened a federal investigation into the case Monday night, senior White House officials kept quiet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all the while, according to White House press secretary Jay Carney, Obama was reading news stories about the case. Top Justice Department officials had informed White House aides in recent days that it wasn't improper for the president to speak out about the ongoing investigation into Martin's shooting, according to a government official with knowledge of those conversations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urged by Sharpton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, an Obama ally who led a rally attended by thousands Thursday at a park in Sanford, Fla., the city where Martin was killed, said he thought it was important for the president to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It really brings home to people that this kid is not some potential thug in a hoodie,&quot; said Sharpton, who said he had been in touch with the Justice Department but not Obama in recent days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, described his clients as humbled by Obama's comments. &quot;How can we thank him?&quot; Crump said they wanted to know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's comments and his approach to the Florida shooting contrasted from his handling of a similarly racially charged issue early in his administration: the arrest by a white police officer of his friend and Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr., who is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked at a news conference in 2009 about the incident, Obama said police had &quot;acted stupidly&quot; in arresting Gates. His remarks created a political furor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling Obama's response to the Gates arrest &quot;a disaster for the president&quot; because he passed judgment on what had happened, Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary for President George W. Bush, said Obama's message Friday was a welcome contrast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There really is an issue of whether if you are black in America today, if you are dressed the way you are dressed, that that can make you a victim,&quot; Fleischer said. &quot;These are society's most delicate issues, and I thought the president handled it delicately.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 24--LeBron James and his Miami Heat teammates did not make a show of their support of slain teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin during the pregame warm-up portion of tonight's game against the Detroit Pistons at the Palace of Auburn Hills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, James and Heat guard Dwayne Wade posted photos on Twitter of themselves and their teammates wearing hooded sweatshirts, or hoodies, in support of Martin, who was shot and killed by a neighborhood crime-watch volunteer Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla., while wearing a hoodie while returning to a gated community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of a clearly visible display, some Heat players opted for a quiet statement by writing messages on their shoes. James wrote &quot;RIP Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot; on his shoes and Chris Bosch wrote &quot;We Want Justice&quot; on his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the only thing we want is we just want to make sure that we shed some light on the situation and let (people) know this is not just something happening in the community where it happened,&quot; Wade said after the Heat's 88-73 victory. &quot;This is worldwide. We want to be a part of it until justice is served.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wade said the players planned a similar tactic for their next game, Sunday night at Oklahoma City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the game, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said the photo of the players taken at the team hotel after this morning's shootaround showed great unity and that the players had the team's full support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a powerful statement today. ... And it really is a tragic story,&quot; he said. &quot;The more you learn about it the more confused you get. For them to come together to draw more light on the subject I think is a powerful move. And we all stand behind them; not only the staff but the Miami Heat organization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pistons coach Lawrence Frank repeatedly called the killing a &quot;travesty&quot; and said he had no problem with the Heat taking part in a pregame demonstration of support. The Heat reportedly had planned to pay tribute to Martin before the game and a Florida state lawmaker urged them to wear hoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the great country we live in,&quot; he said. &quot;Like I said, it's a travesty what happened. The whole country's appalled. Obviously it hits home because it took place in south Florida. But from a nation standpoint, that's something that should never happen and it's an alarming thing that it's still happening. Like I said, everyone's entitled to their own opinion and whatever stance the players take that's their right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Pistons' youngest players, center Greg Monroe, also said before the game he had no problem with the Heat demonstrating. Above all, Monroe advocated patience and careful judgment in the Martin case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just hope that justice is served and the right outcome is found,&quot; said Monroe, 21. &quot;I probably only know what's reported. You never know the whole story till everybody tells their side. But as long as the truth comes out that's all I'll I'm worried about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unfortunate situation anytime someone is dying. Your heart and your prayers go out to his family, but you just want to make sure that justice is served. If someone has committed a crime they should be punished for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOLLOW THE GAME HERE </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LeBron James added 17 points and 10 rebounds and Chris Bosh had 15 points and nine rebounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Heat paid tribute to Florida teen Trayvon Martin, who was killed by a neighborhood watchman on Feb. 26, by writing messages on their sneakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brandon Knight led Detroit with 18 points. Tayshaun Prince had 11 points and seven rebounds and Ben Gordon scored 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami's third quarter lead ballooned to 26 before Gordon scored five straight points to make it 65-44 midway through the period. But the Heat answered with a Wade dunk off a pass from James, then, Mario Chalmers came up with a steal and eventually nailed a triple to take the lead back up to 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Bynum made four straight free throws to make it 72-57 at the end of the third. The Pistons made one more run in the fourth, closing to within nine on a Jonas Jerebko dunk. But pulled away with jumpers by Wade and Bosh with under 8 minutes to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pistons were without Rodney Stuckey, who missed his second straight game after suffering a toe injury during the recent West Coast trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detroit allowed Miami to shoot 44% (34-for-77) from the field and Heat made 18 of 20 free throws. The Pistons shot 39% (29-for-75) and were outrebounded, 45-39. Detroit also had 21 turnovers and Gordon had seven of those.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After leading by seven at the end of the first quarter, Miami opened the second with a 13-3 run, which included five points from former Mr. Basketball Shane Battier (Birmingham Detroit Country Day), to take a 40-23 lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the final 2 minutes of the period, Udonis Haslem hit a jump shot, followed by James basket and a Wade bucket with 4 seconds left. The Heat led by 23, 59-36, at the half.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 24--The Miami Heat got a lot of attention before Friday night's 88-73 win over the Pistons for their demonstration in support of justice in the case of slain teenager Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When game time arrived, the Heat made a quiet statement with short messages written on its players' shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami chose to make its loudest statement on the court with its inspired play as it trampled on the Pistons and shot 57.1% in the first half and taking a 59-36 lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pistons seemed to stage their own sort of protest -- against the basic principles of basketball. Offense. Defense. You name it, the Pistons pretty much failed at it on their way to a fourth straight loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dwyane Wade led the Heat (35-11) with 24 points, and LeBron James had 17 points and 10 assists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brandon Knight scored 18 points and was 4-for-4 on three-pointers. He entered the game tied with Lindsey Hunter (1993-94) for the Pistons' rookie record with 69 season three-pointers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otherwise, the Pistons had few highlights as the Heat ran wild.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, any time a team like that that is extremely well-coached and is together for time, they are going to continue to get better because they will understand how to play off each other and with each other,&quot; Pistons coach Lawrence Frank said. &quot;In different game situations they understand the different time and score, when they have to crank it up a little bit. So they obviously have a high-level team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The postscript Lawrence didn't add was that the Pistons clearly weren't at that level Friday. They gave up 27 points on 23 turnovers -- two short of their season worst. They shot 52.9% from the free-throw line and simply looked outmanned all over the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We played well all game,&quot; James said. &quot;Other than our turnovers in the third quarter, we played a pretty good game. We held a pretty good offensive team to 70-plus points, so we played well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pistons shot 38.7% from the field, and one of the most inexplicable performances came from shooting guard Ben Gordon. He was white hot Wednesday at Denver, when he tied the NBA record by going 9-for-9 on three pointers. On Friday, he went 0-for-4 from behind the arc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third quarter brought some hope to the Pistons and enlivened their fans. Mostly through the play of reserves, they outscored the Heat, 21-13, in the quarter. By the fourth quarter, the Pistons had cut the deficit to 74-65 with 8:58 left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We showed toughness coming back in the game,&quot; Jonas Jerebko said. &quot;But at the same time, we gave them the lead in the beginning and never really got back after that. We've got to try harder than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SANFORD, Fla. (MCT) ? Members of the New Black Panther Party are offering a $10,000 reward for the &quot;capture&quot; of George Zimmerman, leader Mikhail Muhammad announced during a protest in Sanford Saturday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly saying: &quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.&quot; The bounty announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilization of 5,000 black men to capture George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last month. Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland and Jacksonville ? where the 28-year-old worked before the shooting, employees there said.  Muhammad said the group's national chairman, Dr. Malik Zulu Shabaz of Washington, D.C., is receiving donations from black entertainers and athletes. They hope to collect $1 million by next week, Muhammad said. The party said they would not release the names of donors nor would they provide documentation to support the existence of donations. The New Black Panthers announced the reward at a protest in Sanford on Saturday, the activist group's third protest in the past two weeks over the fatal shooting of the Miami Gardens teen. The group called for Zimmerman's arrest and threatened to find and detain him if police were not willing to do so. But group members didn't call for the mobilization of thousands until Saturday. Muhammed led the group in chanting &quot;Justice for Trayvon!&quot; and &quot;Black Power!&quot; &quot;If the government won't do the job, we'll do it,&quot; Muhammad said, leading his group of eight party members in chants like &quot;freedom or death&quot; and &quot;justice for Trayvon&quot; while making the iconic gesture of raising their fists into the air. The party members said they are tired of the inaction of government officials ? from Sanford city officials up to the governor, accusing them of lying and delaying justice. They accused newly appointed special prosecutor Angela Corley of being an enemy of the black community. &quot;She has a track record of sending innocent young black men and women to prison,&quot; he said. Attorneys for the family of Trayvon and Zimmerman offered different perspectives Saturday on the federal investigation of the shooting. Daryl D. Parks, an attorney for the Martin family, told board members of the National Association of Black Journalists that family members met with federal and local officials for more than an hour Thursday. He said the family left the meeting &quot;with a strong sense that justice was very committed&quot; to investigating the case. Meanwhile, an attorney representing Zimmerman said Saturday that he believes the state's &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; law applies to the case, absolving him of any legal ramifications. Attorney Craig Sonner said his client has been unfairly portrayed as a racist. Contributing: Associated Press </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Ottawa Citizen editorial:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin is an illustration of how dangerous badly drafted laws can be. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of the unarmed 17-year-old boy, shot by a self-appointed neighbourhood-watch volunteer, has prompted demands that the shooter be arrested. Under Florida's controversial &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, that is likely not possible. The law says people have the right to use deadly force if they &quot;reasonably&quot; believe they or other persons are threatened with death or serious harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was detained but released by police who say they believed his account that Martin started the scuffle and that Zimmerman fired in self-defence. Under the law, there is no requirement to prove either imminent danger or the need to use deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Canada, we have had our own self-defence debate in recent years. The result is a streamlined law that gives those acting in self-defence more leeway and should avoid future cases such as that of Toronto shopkeeper David Chen, who was charged with assault and forcible confinement after tying up a man who had stolen some plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clarifying archaic laws is a good thing, but giving vigilantes power to take the law into their hands is not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the Jacksonville NAACP said Friday that State Attorney Angela Corey's willingness to charge minors as adults, many of them black teenage males, gives him some concern about her appointment to head up the investigation into the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Isaiah Rumlin said he does have concerns about Corey's selection because of her handling of cases like the Cristian Fernandez prosecution, he is looking for her to aggressively pursue justice in the Martin case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There might have been some poor judgments that she's made in this city since becoming the state attorney, but we're hoping that she goes down there and does the right thing, and that is to indict the gentlemen who murdered Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Rumlin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was killed in late February in Sanford by George Zimmerman, 28, who said he was defending himself. Zimmerman has not been charged, and that has sparked national protests and calls to re-examine the state's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law. Corey was named by Gov. Rick Scott Thursday to lead the Martin investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Corey's office said she wouldn't be available for comment Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacksonville Sheriff John Rutherford said Corey will help to ensure justice is done in the Martin case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the Martin family knew Angela Corey, I think they would be comforted by the fact that she is handling that case,&quot; Rutherford said. &quot;Knowing Angela, being a state prosecutor is not just a job for her, it's a calling. Angela, I'm confident, regardless of sentiment will take the facts of the case and apply the law and let the chips fall where they may. Justice, whatever that justice may be, is going to be served in the Martin case with Angela heading it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandy D'Alemberte, former president of the American Bar Association and former president of Florida State University, criticized Scott's selection of Corey for the Martin case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot imagine a worse choice for a prosecutor to serve in the Sanford case,&quot; D'Alemberte said in an email. &quot;There is nothing in Angela Corey's background that suits her for this task, and she cannot command the respect of people who care about justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D'Alemberte and Corey have sparred over Corey's handling of the Fernandez case. Corey indicted Fernandez at age 12, making him the youngest person to be charged with first-degree murder in Jacksonville history. He is charged with the beating death of his 2-year-old half-brother. Corey is proceeding with the charge against Fernandez despite international pleas for the boy not to be prosecuted as an adult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Hallett, chairman of the University of North Florida's Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, said the Martin case provides an opportunity for Corey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's an interesting contrast to Cristian Fernandez because it will provide the opportunity for Angela Corey to show concern for a black victim,&quot; Hallet said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the Martin case gives Corey a chance to take the &quot;spotlight&quot; off the Fernandez case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, Hallett said Corey is a good choice to take over the investigation into Martin's killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that because we have so much gun crime in Duval County, Angela Corey is a good choice,&quot; he said. &quot;Choosing Angela Corey goes a long way toward setting the law enforcement community at ease because she has such a strong relationship with law enforcement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former State Attorney Harry Shorstein wouldn't comment on Corey running the case because he said it'd be inappropriate. But he did speak to the challenges of being on a governor's assignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The difficulty arises sometime from logistics, like travel time, and you are working with agencies that you're not used to dealing with,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he considered such assignments an honor, Shorstein also said the cases take time away from the state attorney's own case load.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It takes you away from your primary responsibility, which is to run your own office,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama has made his first public remarks on the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, saying that the Florida teenager's death was a tragedy that needed to be fully investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a personal message delivered from the White House, the US president likened the 17-year-old to his own children, and said: &quot;If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama vowed that authorities would look into &quot;every aspect&quot; of the shooting of the unarmed black teenager by neighbourhood watch captain George Zimmerman, and called on federal, state and local authorities to work together as part of the investigation. The justice department and the FBI are investigating the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was killed on 26 February in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. He was returning to his father's girlfriend's house after buying sweets at a convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Zimmerman admits he shot the teenager, he says it was in self-defence during a confrontation, citing Florida's controversial &quot;stand your ground&quot; law that allows the use of lethal force in certain circumstances. Zimmerman has not been arrested, sparking growing anger that has spread beyond Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously this is a tragedy. I can only imagine what these parents are going through,&quot; Obama told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids, and I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said that all of America had some &quot;soul searching&quot; to do over the incident, adding: &quot;If I had a son he, would look like Trayvon and I think they (his parents) are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney later joined the president in calling for a thorough investigation. He added that a full inquiry was needed so that &quot;justice is carried out with impartiality and integrity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has sparked a fierce debate over whether there was a racial element to the shooting - Zimmerman is Hispanic - and if America's gun legislation should be changed, in particular the Florida &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's law was changed in 2005. Under the previous legislation, people could use deadly force in self-defence only if they had tried to run away or otherwise avoid the danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new law, there is no duty to retreat, and it gives a Floridian the right &quot;to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force,&quot; if he or she feels threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford's police chief Bill Lee stepped down temporarily this week. The announcement was followed by news that Florida state attorney Norman Wolfinger had also recused himself following criticism of his handling of the case. But neither move appeared to soothe the growing discontent or quieten calls for Zimmerman to be arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday night, the 17-year-old's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, were joined by civil rights leaders including the Rev Al Sharpton at a rally in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton told those gathered: &quot;We cannot allow a precedent when a man can just kill one of us and then walk out with the murder weapon. We want George Zimmerman in court with handcuffs behind his back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon is your son,&quot; said an emotional Fulton, Trayvon's mother. &quot;I just want to say thank you for all of your support. It means a lot to me and my family.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama made two statements that mattered at the White House yesterday. The first, identifying himself with the family of the shot black teenager Trayvon Martin, exemplified why this president is special. The other, nominating Jim Yong Kim to run the World Bank, showed him as a business-as-usual US leader. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr Obama gave him the nod, the Dartmouth professor, Dr Kim, was declared &quot;front-runner&quot; for the Bank job by the New York Times. That was not speculation. It represents a consensus among Bank-watchers and development hands alike. Never mind that the selection process has not even begun, with plenty of other names still on the table. Never mind, too, that Dr Kim is a relatively obscure academic. What matters above all else is that he is America's choice. And, when it comes to who is in charge of one of the most important institutions in the global economy - lending about $16bn (&pound;10bn) last year alone, and with over 10,000 employees, what America says goes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a corrupt process. It continues one of the longest-running gentlemen's agreements in economic history, which decrees that the IMF must always be run by a European, while an American has to head the World Bank. Whatever the interests of the vast majority of their actual member states in Asia, Latin America and Africa, the cosy club endures. It is a rotten system. Rotten for the countries who call on the World Bank or the IMF for assistance, rotten for the institutions themselves, and not even much good for those governments that call the shots either. The cartelisation means that the Fund and the Bank get neither the best managers nor the freshest thinking. The system has done great harm to the Bank in recent years: George Bush's first nominee, Paul Wolfowitz, was forced out after arranging a promotion for his girlfriend. His second, Robert Zoellick, a generally safe pair of hands who is about to step down, tried to sit on a report that blamed surging food prices on the White House's drive for biofuels. Meanwhile, the poor countries that have most to do with these organisations are forced to implement orthodox policies that don't always work or do good. The result is a system with a damaging lack of legitimacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not a narrow argument about nationality. Dr Kim may well be the best man for the job. But for everybody's sake, including his, that should be proved through a fair and transparent selection process. The post should be made open to all applications, and candidates should have to face not just Bank insiders, but members of the public around the world. This is a development institution for the planet, not a sinecure for allies of whoever is sitting in the White House - even when it is Mr Obama.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators torn over whether to concentrate on economic inequality or to move towards protesting police brutality <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Occupy Wall Street returned to the public spotlight this week following the largest mass arrest of its supporters since the movement was evicted from its home base in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend's events, including a female protester apparently having a seizure while handcuffed - combined with numerous accounts of excessive police force - have been described by many protesters as some of the most violent in Occupy history. A New York Daily News reporter on the scene said the New York City police was &quot;out of control&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend, occupiers plan to push back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press conference earlier this week, Occupy participants and community groups that have long criticised the NYPD demanded the resignation of the commissioner, Ray Kelly. On Saturday, Occupy organisers will call on victims of police abuse to join them in a mass demonstration aimed at denouncing a wide range of NYPD policies and practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action will be held in combination with the United Nations' international day for the right to the truth concerning gross human rights violations and for the dignity of victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activists argue that the event is not about Occupy Wall Street, but is a wider critique of NYPD tactics city-wide, particularly in low-income and black communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Occupy organiser, Gary Roland, the demonstration is intended to &quot;tell the truth about the victims of human rights violations by the NYPD.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roland said the department's controversial surveillance of the Muslim community and its widespread use of stop and frisk tactics on the city's streets were two examples of systemic police abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not about OWS,&quot; he added. &quot;This is really about justice for the victims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the week the demonstrators and police have engaged in a public tug of war over Union Square, one of New York City's most widely-recognised and heavily-trafficked public parks. Many have come to view the square as the next potential base of operations for the movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD appears determined to prevent that from happening and - in a rare move - has shut down the park on multiple evenings with barricades and police officers in an attempt to keep demonstrators out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday night, protesters accused police of using excessive force in clearing them from the area. The next night, following a massive demonstration for the shot Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, two bottles were hurled at the police as they moved demonstrators onto the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of demonstrators view the department's efforts at Union Square as an act of political suppression that is at least tacitly condoned by the city's mayor, Michael Bloomberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want to get arrested? We'll accommodate you,&quot; Bloomberg said at a press conference on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you have something, really, to say, that would be a great contribution, nobody can hear you when everybody's yelling and screaming and pushing and shoving.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters have interpreted the mayor's dismissive attitude as a green light for police to embrace heavy-handed tactics. &quot;What we are facing is a police riot breaking loose,&quot; said Alexandre Carvalho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Union Square, now, will be the new battleground of Occupy because it's public,&quot; Carvalho added. &quot;If the police are barricading a public space, it's a declaration of war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many in the movement welcome the revived public attention, questions have been raised over whether the issue of police violence has replaced Occupy's original aim of highlighting economic inequality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cecily McMillan, a protester, said she believes there is room for Occupy to criticise both police violence and disparities in wealth. Last weekend videos emerged showing her having an apparent seizure while handcuffed on the sidewalk. McMillan has been charged with assaulting a police officer, an allegation that she denies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police brutality is something that we share right now between Occupy and other community groups,&quot; McMillan told the Guardian. &quot;It's something that needs to be addressed immediately. But I do think it is important to move forward and continue to talk about police brutality alongside economic brutality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMillan said she believes Occupy should continue to reach out to communities impacted by police violence, and points to the involvement of protesters at Wednesday's march for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as a step in the right direction. She described the Occupy presence in the march as &quot;a true step towards actually having a movement of the 99%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been working with Occupy Wall Street since August, particularly with outreach, and that was the first time that I saw a really strong bridge between Occupy and the general public at large,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMillan said the resignation of Kelly would not be enough to stem the tide of police violence in New York City. &quot;We need to talk about the systematic problems that lead to police violence. The ridiculous assumptions concerning low-income groups and people of colour that lead police to feel justified in performing police brutality.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrea Bargnani added 21 points and seven rebounds for the Raptors (16-32), who handed the Knicks their first loss under interim coach Mike Woodson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amar'e Stoudemire - who wore a hoodie during warm-ups in support of slain Florida teen Trayvon Martin - led the Knicks (23-25) with 17 points and six rebounds. New York came into the game on a five-game win streak that started with the resignation of former coach Mike D'Antoni on March 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes after putting down an alley-oop dunk in the fourth, DeRozan fell awkwardly on Jose Calderon while battling for a rebound. He got up gingerly, ran off the floor and into the tunnel. He did not return and there was no report on his condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a miserable night for the Knicks' emerging star Jeremy Lin. The point guard went 3 for 9 and finished the night with six points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Raptors, who crumbled late in the game against Chicago on Wednesday, looked shaky early in the fourth as New York pulled to within 70-60 on four points from J.R. Smith and a three-pointer by Steve Novak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Knicks came out aggressive in the third as Lin hit a jumper from the corner and a Stoudamire dunk made it 41-40 just two minutes into the second half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lin heard plenty of boos as he clanked two three-point attempts in the second quarter.</SPAN></P>

It was definitely about guns.Quick primer: On Feb. 26, Martin, a black, 17-year-old high school senior, was walking through a gated community, carrying snacks on his way to a friend's house.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a Hispanic, 28-year-old Neighborhood Watch volunteer, shot and killed him.There were no witnesses on site. A 16-year-old girl who was on the phone with Martin before he was shot told police that Martin told her that a man was following him; she advised Martin to run. She heard a scuffle, and the call ended.When police arrived, Zimmerman, who had a bloody nose and a wound on the back of his head, invoked Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law. Like North Carolina's &quot;Castle Doctrine,&quot; Florida's law permits the use of deadly force in defense of oneself, without fear of prosecution.North Carolina's Castle Doctrine, which became law last December, expanded the right to use deadly force beyond a person's home, to include businesses and vehicles, and added &quot;a person is justified in the use of deadly force and does not have a duty to retreat in any place he or she has the lawful right to be if ... [h]e or she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another.&quot;A lot of North Carolinians, including this editorial board, argued that these sloppily written laws attempt to circumvent basic American justice. Self-defense has been a successful defense for as long as court records have been kept; these new laws seem designed to avoid the courthouse altogether.Worse, it's not just the courthouse. These laws seem designed to relieve people from applying their own basic judgment, let along anyone else's.Zimmerman apparently thought he was one of the good guys, a white hat, but since the Stand Your Ground law might allow him to escape the scrutiny of a courtroom, how can he know?Isn't it reasonable that the fear of a deadly threat increases with the likelihood that others have the power to harm us - a possibility that increases as gun laws are relaxed? What is the goal? To spiral ever downward until everyone is armed because everyone else is armed, quick on the trigger because any confrontation could become a deadly assault?But, as seems to be the case with gun-toting Zimmerman and unarmed Martin, a person's sense of his or her own fear of threat is not the best measure of his or her actual danger.Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death is a bloody illustration that these sloppy gun-rights laws are no substitute for the justice system - in Florida, in North Carolina, or anywhere else.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When are &quot;stand your ground&quot; gun laws a license to kill?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a Florida neighborhood watch leader last month sparked a national debate on self-defense laws that allow the use of deadly force. A Cleveland County civil rights leader says North Carolina's law doesn't need to be changed as long as it's applied properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's nothing wrong with the law that I can see at this point,&quot; said Willie McIntosh, president of the county's NAACP chapter. &quot;To me, that shooting was a blatant disregard for the law.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titled &quot;A Bill to Amend Various Gun Laws,&quot; N.C. General Statute 14-51.3, which took effect in December, states that a person &quot;does not have a duty to retreat in any place he or she has the lawful right to be&quot; and is justified in the use of deadly force if he or she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">District Attorney Rick Shaffer said prosecutors weigh many factors when determining whether to file charges against a shooter claiming self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, I try to determine from available evidence whether the party claiming the right to use force was the aggressor in the situation,&quot; Shaffer wrote in an email to The Star. &quot;If there is substantial and credible evidence the person was the aggressor, then he is not in a good position to claim he was acting in self defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The district attorney also takes into account the size, age and physical condition of both the aggressor and victim as well as the &quot;availability of alternative to force,&quot; Shaffer wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Kneejerk reaction'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Assembly passed that statute last June in a gun law reform bill that included the Castle Doctrine, which states that lawful occupants can use deadly force against intruders in homes, businesses and vehicles. State Rep. Kelly Hastings of Cherryville, a Republican who represents parts of Cleveland and Gaston counties, was a primary sponsor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're in harm's way and you're legitimately in fear, your response has to be proportional and reasonable,&quot; Hastings said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another state lawmaker, Rep. Rodney Moore, D-Mecklenburg, said he wants to rewrite the state statute to prevent shooting deaths like the one in Florida from occurring in North Carolina. Hastings said tweaking the statute is unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think people are having a kneejerk reaction without understanding the law,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Carolina's new statute codifies and clarifies existing case law that has been on the books for many years, said John Rubin, a professor of public law and government at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This statute reflects the state of the law that already existed, but makes it clearer,&quot; Rubin said. &quot;The basic principle still remains ? a reasonable person would have to believe they're faced with death or great bodily harm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">N.C. law similar to Florida's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on Feb. 26. Martin was returning to his gated community in Sanford, Fla., from a nearby convenience store. Zimmerman told police he shot Martin in self-defense after the teen attacked him. He has not been arrested or charged in the death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's law ? which is similar to North Carolina's ? states that a resident &quot;has no duty to retreat&quot; from an assailant and can use deadly force if he or she reasonably believes doing so is necessary to prevent &quot;death or great bodily harm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rubin said that the lack of charges against Zimmerman &quot;raises concerns about how Florida is interpreting the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The wording is similar,&quot; he said, comparing the North Carolina and Florida statutes. &quot;I'm not sure I'd be willing to say the way we interpret it is similar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McIntosh said the neighborhood watch captain confronted Martin and instigated the scuffle with the unarmed teen. He said Zimmerman had no reasonable belief his life was in danger and the shooting isn't justified under either Florida or North Carolina law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody's safe if they're going to stretch the law that far,&quot; McIntosh said. &quot;The law was not written for that reason.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A national outcry followed Martin's death, with civil rights groups staging protest rallies across the East Coast and mounting calls for the Sanford police officials who investigated the shooting to be fired. The U.S. Department of Justice is now investigating the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would Zimmerman face charges if the shooting happened here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is dangerous to comment on whether a person should or should not be charged with a crime based on reports of evidence without having access to the investigative file,&quot; Shaffer wrote. &quot;However, if it is true that the volunteer who is accused of shooting Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was advised not to pursue Mr. Martin, and did so anyway, had no reason to believe Mr. Martin was a threat to him at the time he pursued him and placed himself in a situation where he confronted Mr. Martin, and Martin had no weapon on his person, I see absolutely no reason that (Mr. Zimmerman) would not have been charged with at least second degree murder in North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENGLEWOOD -- A march is being organized Sunday in Bergen County to  bring awareness to the shooting death of a 17-year old unarmed  black teenager in Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The NAACP of Bergen County and Mount Calvary Baptist Church are  planning the demonstration, which will begin after Sunday service  at 1 p.m. Participants will gather at the church and walk to Mackay  Park.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;From my viewpoint if it happened in Florida, it could very well  happen in New Jersey,&quot; said Anthony Cureton, the NAACP chapter  president.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Trayvon Martin was fatally shot on Feb. 26 while he was walking  from a convenience store to his father's home in the Florida city  of Sanford. George Zimmerman, 28, told investigators he shot Martin  in self-defense after the teen attacked him.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Zimmerman has not been arrested or charged.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Prior to the shooting, Zimmerman told police dispatchers Martin  looked suspicious. One dispatcher told Zimmerman not to pursue  Martin, according to news reports. At some point, the two got into  a fight and Zimmerman pulled out his gun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Zimmerman told police Martin attacked him after he had given up on  chasing the teenager and was returning to his sport utility  vehicle.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The shooting has ignited resentment toward the police department in  Florida. The police chief has temporarily stepped down, and the  prosecutor has quit the case. Civil rights groups have held rallies  in Florida and New York, saying the shooting was unjustified.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Cureton said stereotypes led to the killing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;Here's a young man walking in a hoodie, and he was perceived to be  one thing, when he wasn't,&quot; Cureton said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Justice Department and FBI have opened a civil rights  investigations on the case, and the prosecutor convened a grand  jury to determine whether to charge Zimmerman.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Amar'e Stoudemire arrived at Air Canada Centre in a sweater with a  hood raised over his head and when he took the court for pregame  warm-ups, he wore a Knicks hoodie, the hood again over his head.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stoudemire wanted to show his support for the protests in the wake  of the fatal shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last month by a community  watchman. Part of the reasoning for the shooting was that the  17-year-old was threatening because he was wearing a hoodie.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I mean, it's just a matter of us understanding that we all have to  be positive influences on the community,&quot; said Stoudemire, who grew  up in Orlando, just 20 minutes from Sanford, Fla., where the  shooting occurred. &quot;If you're going to be a watchman, be a positive  watchman in the community. I think it's all about uplifting the  community and keeping everybody together for a positive message.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Florida state representative Alan Williams sent out a request via  twitter to Stoudemire, along with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and  Chris Paul to wear hoodies during warm-ups at their games. But  Stoudemire said he had not seen that and chose to do this on his  own.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Stoudemire posted a photo on his Twitter account, @Amareisreal,  wearing a sweater with a hood and declaring that he had his hoodie  on. Carmelo Anthony also posted a photo of himself wearing one with  the words, &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; Wade posted a photo of himself  with a hoodie and spoke out about it, and James then posted a Heat  team photo with the entire group wearing hoodies. <BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Jeffries test  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Jared Jeffries sat out Friday and will undergo an MRI on his right  knee today. He has been troubled by swelling in the knee much of  the season, and hurt it again Wednesday in Philadelphia.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;It's a little bit different,&quot; Jeffries said. &quot;It feels different  because last time it was sore and swollen and we knew what we could  do. This time my knee did buckle and give way so I have to see what  MRI says.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Play in pain  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Baron Davis is playing, but Mike Woodson admitted he won't be 100  percent this season -- neither his hamstring that sidelined him  last week nor the back that sidelined him most of the season.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama has stepped into the growing controversy over the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, telling a news conference that America has some &quot;soul-searching&quot; to do over the killing of the unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President, who previously described Trayvon's death as a &quot;local issue&quot;, said yesterday he empathised with the parents of the boy, who was shot last month by a neighbourhood vigilante in suburban Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,&quot; he told reporters at the White House yesterday. &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. They are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves and that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama's decision to speak out about Trayvon's killing, in such personal terms, represents a calculated gamble. Although the case has sparked international outrage, it also risks widening racial divides in an election year. Trayvon, who was 17 and had no criminal record, was shot on 26 March as he walked from a convenience store to the home of his father's girlfriend, in a gated community in the commuter town of Sanford, just outside Orlando. Police failed to arrest his killer, a local vigilante called George Zimmerman, apparently accepting at face value that he had acted in self-defence, and claiming that a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law enacted in Florida at the behest of the gun lobby would prevent his successful prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of the killing, it has emerged that they discounted the evidence of several witnesses, and misleadingly told the media that Mr Zimmerman, 28, was a &quot;squeaky-clean&quot; individual with no criminal record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It subsequently emerged that he had a previous arrest for battery and had been accused of domestic violence. In the past year, he had called emergency services almost 50 times to complain about &quot;suspicious persons&quot; in his neighbourhood. The majority of them turned out to be black.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama has stepped into the growing controversy over the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, telling a news conference that America has some &quot;soul searching&quot; to do over the killing of the unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President, who previously described Trayvon's death as a &quot;local issue,&quot; said yesterday that he empathised with the parents of the boy, who was shot last month by a neighbourhood vigilante in suburban Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,&quot; he told reporters at the White House yesterday morning. &quot;If I had a son he'd look like Trayvon. They are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves and that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama's decision to speak out about Trayvon's killing, in such personal terms, represents a calculated gamble. Although the case has sparked international outrage, it also risks widening racial divides in an election year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, who was 17 and had no criminal record, was shot on 26 March as he walked from a convenience store to the home of his father's girlfriend, in a gated community in the commuter town of Sanford, just outside Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police failed to even arrest his killer, a local vigilante called George Zimmerman, apparently accepting at face value that he had acted in self-defence, and claiming that a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law enacted in Florida at the behest of the gun lobby would prevent his successful prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of the killing, it has emerged that they discounted the evidence of several witnesses, and misleadingly told the media that Mr Zimmerman, 28, was a &quot;squeaky clean&quot; individual with no criminal record. It subsequently emerged that he had a previous arrest for battery and had been accused of domestic violence. In the past year, he had called emergency services almost 50 times to complain about &quot;suspicious persons&quot; in his neighbourhood. The majority of them turned out to be black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his 911 call on the night of Trayvon's death, he appeared to use a racial slur to describe his eventual victim as a &quot;f***ing coon&quot;. And he was never asked why he had been forced to use a 9mm pistol to ward off a child who weighed at least 100lbs less than him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford's chief of police has resigned, pending a review of his department, which has faced widespread accusations of racial bias in this and several other cases. Mr Zimmerman, who was described by police as a &quot;white male&quot; but claims to be Hispanic, is now in hiding. In his remarks, Mr Obama suggested that Trayvon's death ought to prompt states such as Florida to reconsider &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws, which have led to scores of murder cases being abandoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative to investigate every aspect of this and that everybody pulls together - federal, state and local - to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened,&quot; he said. &quot;all of us have to do some soul searching ... That means we examine the laws, the context for what happened, as well as the specifics of the incident.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protest and privilege make uneasy bedfellows. It's getting dark in Manhattan, thousands of young people in hoodies have taken to the streets, and brightly coloured sweets are crunching underfoot. Seventeen-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was carrying a bag of Skittles, a bottle of iced tea and no weapons when he was shot dead in Florida last month, and the police have still failed to punish his killer. At this march, called in protest at institutional violence against young black men in America, demonstrators toss Skittles over the pavement and carry iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the poorest urban communities, police brutality and financial injustice have always been part of the equation - and it's just the same with the fightback. On the corner of Washington Square, you can hear them yelling the names of victims of police brutality, the name of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the name of Troy Davis, the name of Martin Luther King. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one name I conspicuously do not hear being chanted on this &quot;million hoodie march&quot; is that of Barack Obama. For these young people, the passive politics of hope are staggeringly insufficient. When savage injustice becomes part of the weave of daily life, it is hard to determine at what particular moment the heart says, &quot;enough&quot;. It is hard to pinpoint how many bloodied young women, how many dead young men and how many police officers walking casually away it will take before the collective imagination of a community or a country decides that there has been one outrage too many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We live, however, in interesting times, when what has been suffered in weary silence for years can become the occasion for a riot at the discharge of a single gun. As the army of hooded, angry people whoops and hollers and streams down Sixth Avenue, the expression on the faces of the white couples eating dinner in nearby restaurants is familiar to me. I saw the same mask of quiet panic flicker over the faces of friends and colleagues, peering out of their windows during last summer's riots in London, which were also catalysed by the fatal shooting of a young black man by police. It's an expression that says: who are these kids, and where did they come from? Have we always lived side by side with them and never noticed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer is yes, and well-to-do-liberals might be advised to consider seriously how they will react, however progressive they feel themselves to be, the next time an enormous crowd of angry black teenagers in hoodies marches up the high street. Today, significantly, it is impossible to tell who has worn their everyday clothes to this march, and who has pulled on a hood and tracksuit in a show of solidarity. I spot university professors in hoods, homeless buskers in hoods, and one Hollywood actor in a hood - from a few feet away, they all look the same, a menacing mass with justice and vengeance on its mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the North American protest movement is about to learn, to its credit, what the British youth uprisings failed at first to anticipate: that one cannot deal with issues of race and class simply by ignoring them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the killing of young black boys is rarely news in North America, when young white women were kettled and pepper-sprayed by the police during the first days of Occupy Wall Street their tear-smeared faces made headlines across the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The learning curve of white privilege is steep, especially for those who weren't aware that they had it. While outrage against systemic police brutality galvanised Occupy Wall Street and united disparate communities under its banner, many black activists are unhappy with what they see as the &quot;co-opting&quot; of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death. &quot;They're trying to make out that it's the same thing, and it's really, really not,&quot; says 23-year-old Nike. As ranks of armed police march into the square, as the barricades go up and the batons come out, Lee, also 23, yells: &quot;I guarantee you, the first people trampled and arrested will be people of colour. Like every time. I guarantee it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments were the president's first on the explosive case, in which a neighborhood watch captain has claimed self-defense after killing an unarmed 17-year-old. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama spoke in highly personal terms Friday about how the shooting in Florida of a black 17-year-old named Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had affected him, saying that ''if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments by Mr. Obama were his first on the explosive case, in which a neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, has claimed self-defense after killing Mr. Martin. The case has generated outrage about the state's so-called Stand Your Ground law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama was asked about his feelings regarding the case during the announcement of his nominee for president of the World Bank in the Rose Garden on Friday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president often appears perturbed when he is asked off-topic questions at ceremonial events, but on Friday he seemed eager to address the case, which has quickly developed into a heated issue around the country and made headlines overseas. He cautioned that his comments would be limited because the Justice Department was investigating. But he talked at length about his personal feelings about the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this,'' Mr. Obama said. ''All of us have to do some soul searching to figure out how does something like this happen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brief remarks were nonetheless a rare example of Mr. Obama speaking to the nation as an African-American parent and the father of two children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Obviously, this is a tragedy. I can only imagine what these parents are going through,'' Mr. Obama said, his face grim. ''When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most powerful line came at the end of his brief remarks, as he said that his ''main message'' was directed at the parents of Mr. Martin, who have expressed their deep grief during interviews on television over the last several days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,'' Mr. Obama said, pausing for a moment. ''I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and we are going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama sidestepped some of the most sensitive and politically charged specifics about the case - whether Mr. Zimmerman should be arrested; whether the Florida law goes too far in protecting people who shoot others; whether the police chief in Sanford, where the shooting took place, should be fired. (The chief, Bill Lee, stepped down temporarily on Thursday, saying he had become a distraction to the investigation.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm the head of the executive branch, and the attorney general reports to me,'' Mr. Obama said. ''So I've got to be careful about my statements to make sure that we're not impairing any investigation that's taking place right now.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of supporters of Mr. Martin's parents expressed their outrage about the killing at a rally in Florida on Thursday night, adding to the growing political dimensions of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting took place Feb. 26, when Mr. Zimmerman, 28, pursued, confronted and fatally shot Mr. Martin, an unarmed high school student carrying only an iced tea and a bag of Skittles candy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican candidates for president on Friday also condemned the shooting, calling it a tragedy that demanded further investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the Republican hopefuls had made mention of the case as it played out on television during the past week. But three of them ended their silence shortly after Mr. Obama weighed in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of them, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, said they believed that the state's self-defense law did not apply in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''As I understand Florida law, what he was doing had nothing to do with the law that people are talking about,'' Mr. Gingrich told reporters in Port Fourchon, Louisiana, where he was campaigning ahead of the state's Saturday primary election. ''The law involved somebody who's coming at you. As I understand it, he was trailing the young man. The young man wasn't trailing him. I suspect justice will be done.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum said that the law should not be used to excuse what Mr. Zimmerman is accused of doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's a difference between stand your ground and doing what he did,'' Mr. Santorum said Friday. ''It's a horrible case. I mean, it's chilling to hear what happened, and of course the fact that law enforcement didn't immediately go after and prosecute this case is another chilling example of horrible decisions made by people in this process.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum's comments came as he held a rally at a shooting range in Louisiana. Mr. Santorum fired a pistol at a target at the range as one woman in the crowd shouted, ''Pretend it's Obama!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney issued a statement from his campaign saying: ''What happened to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is a tragedy. There needs to be a thorough investigation that reassures the public that justice is carried out with impartiality and integrity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case of Mr. Martin's death could potentially put the candidates in a delicate position with some elements of the Republican base. Self-defense laws like the one in Florida are strongly backed by the National Rifle Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statements from the candidates suggested they wanted to express outrage about the shooting without directly criticizing those laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time Mr. Obama waded into a racially charged incident, it became a political problem for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked at a news conference about the arrest of a black Harvard professor in 2009, Mr. Obama offered his opinion, saying that the white officer from Cambridge, Massachusetts, had acted ''stupidly,'' which began a weeklong controversy about what he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think it's fair to say, No. 1, any of us would be pretty angry; No. 2, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, No. 3 , what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there's a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately,'' Mr. Obama said at the time. ''That's just a fact.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama eventually invited the professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr., and the police officer, James Crowley, to the White House to discuss the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite that incident, the president has been careful not to wade into racial politics. As the nation's first African-American president, he is sometimes criticized by black leaders who say he is not doing enough to deal with problems in that community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the issue in a news conference in his first few months in office, Mr. Obama defended his approach as one that ''will lift all boats'' by working to ''level the playing field and ensure bottom-up economic growth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm confident that that will help the African-American community live out the American dream at the same time that it's helping communities all across the country,'' Mr Obama said in April 2009.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI - Wearing a hoodie. Listening to music and talking on his cellphone. Picking up Skittles for his soon-to-be stepbrother. Friends say that's how they would have imagined 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on a Sunday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starting a fight? Possibly high on drugs and up to no good? No, friends say that description of Martin from the neighborhood crime-watch volunteer who shot and killed the unarmed black teenager doesn't match the young man they knew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no way I can believe that, because he's not a confrontational kid,&quot; said Jerome Horton, who was one of Martin's former football coaches and knew him since he was about 5. &quot;It just wouldn't happen. That's just not that kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was slain in the town of Sanford on Feb. 26 in a shooting that has set off a nationwide furor over race and justice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighborhood crime-watch captain George Zimmerman, whose father is white and mother is Hispanic, claimed self-defense and has not been arrested, though state and federal authorities are still investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since his death, Martin's name and photographs - in football jerseys, smiling alongside a baby, and staring into the camera in a gray hoodie - have been held up by civil rights leaders and at rallies stretching from Miami to New York demanding Zimmerman's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Millersville University, more than 50 people took part in a &quot;hoodie walk&quot; Friday night and signed a petition seeking justice for Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marchers chanted &quot;iced tea is not a weapon&quot; and &quot;Skittles is just a snack&quot; and carried signs bearing messages including, &quot;Don't shoot my brothers&quot; and &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roommates Saresa Williams and Alia Thomas, both juniors from Philadelphia studying social work, said they hoped to raise awareness of the social injustice of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A young man lost his life for no reason,&quot; Thomas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akeem Johnson, a senior communications and broadcast major, walked carrying a sign saying, &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I listened to it on YouTube. I damn near cried listening to him and then the shot,&quot; Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a black man, Johnson said, he could easily put himself in Martin's situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just the other day, he said, he was walking with his girlfriend and a dog in an area just off campus when a man came outside and asked them what they were doing in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said he felt afraid, even though it was daylight and he was doing nothing wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It made me feel less of a man,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, President Barack Obama called the shooting a tragedy, vowed to get to the bottom of the case, and added: &quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sentiment was echoed by NBA star by Dwyane Wade, who along with his Miami Heat teammate LeBron James tweeted photos of themselves in hoodies in a show of solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a father, this hits home,&quot; said Wade, who has 10- and 4-year-old sons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Friday that Martin's killing reflects &quot;the classic struggle of our time&quot; and said it echoes the slaying of Emmitt Till, a 14-year-old from Chicago who was murdered in 1954 while visiting Mississippi by a group of white men. No one was ever convicted, but Till's killing galvanized the civil rights movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said he will speak at a Sanford-area church Sunday and then attend a rally in the city Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the slaying, a portrait has emerged of Martin as a laid-back young man who loved sports, was extremely close to his father, liked to crack jokes with friends and, according to a lawyer for his family, had never been in trouble with the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The son of divorced parents, he grew up in working-class neighborhoods north of Miami's downtown. He and his father, a truck driver, were active in the Miramar Optimist Club, an organization that runs sports and academic programs for young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Martin, the teen's father, coached his son's football team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boy was a swift athlete, according to a friend, and played a range of positions up to about age 14. After he stopped playing, he remained active in the organization, volunteering six days a week from June through November of last year to help run the team's concession stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin cooked hamburgers, hot dogs and chicken wings alongside his father at the stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He loved talking to the kids, asking them what position they played and whether they were good, Horton recalled. He would call the mothers &quot;Ma'am,&quot; and if they had a stroller or an item they needed help with, Martin stepped in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone out there loved him,&quot; Horton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was tall and lanky - only 140 pounds, according to the family's attorney - and his nickname was &quot;Slimm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teen spent a big part of his week living with his father in a one-story, peach-colored home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbor Fred Collins Jr. said he would see Trayvon&nbsp;Martin outside every week mowing the lawn and trimming the trees. The teen also helped Collins' son learn how to ride a bike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was coaching him, giving him words of advice, encouragement,&quot; Collins said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one answered the door on a recent afternoon, and a child's plastic tricycle sat in the driveway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Martin often recounted how his son saved his life. The elder Martin had begun heating up some oil to fry fish and fell asleep. The grease caught fire, and when Tracy Martin awoke and tried to put out the flames, he spilled the oil on his legs, severely burning himself. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin pulled his father out of the home and called 911.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents kept a close eye on him, but they didn't have to be too strict, since he stayed out of trouble, Collins said. However, he had recently been suspended from school for five days for tardiness, his English teacher, Michelle Kypriss, told the Orlando Sentinel. School officials did not respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's father was not happy and grounded the teen for the duration of the suspension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon &quot;knew he was wrong,&quot; Horton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under state privacy law, only serious felonies appear on juveniles' public criminal records, and Martin did not have one. Citing the same law, Sanford police Sgt. David Morgenstern said he could neither confirm nor deny the family's statement that Martin had never gotten into legal trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin dreamed of becoming a pilot. He had flown on school vacations to various places around the country with his mother, skiing in Colorado one year, going off to Texas another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no little black kids that want to be pilots,&quot; Horton joked with him when he was about 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I'll be the first one,&quot; the teen replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Dr. Michael M. Krop High School, where Martin was a junior, he was on the quiet side, but he would sit in the middle of the classroom, participate in class and especially liked math.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schoolmates remembered his humorous side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Brrrrian!&quot; he would call out, rolling his r's as is done in Spanish, whenever 16-year-old Brian Paz got a phone call from his Colombian mother, the friend recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd just burst out laughing,&quot; Paz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paz and other friends said Martin liked rap music and funny movies. He had written some lyrics, though he hadn't had a chance yet to perform them. Martin was especially a fan of a student musical group at his school called Bison. He had two of the group's pins on his backpack and helped spread the word about shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Emmanuel, 17, said the group was about encouraging young men to be strong, independent leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's how we liked to think of ourselves,&quot; Emmanuel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin had gone up to Sanford to visit his father's fianc&eacute;e, who lived there with her young son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends said Martin regarded the boy as his little brother and had been looking forward to watching the NBA All-Star game with him that weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On that Sunday, Martin went out to get candy and an iced tea at a convenience store and was walking back to the fiancee's townhouse. Zimmerman, 28, spotted him and told a police dispatcher: &quot;This guy looks like he is up to no good - he is on drugs or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the shooting, Zimmerman claimed that Martin attacked him as he was returning to his truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Martin's friends said they find that hard to believe. They said they had never seen him fight at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as attacking the guy without him attacking him, no way,&quot; Horton said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">AMERICA:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growing demands that 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin s killer be arrested have followed national outrage at the manner of his death, writes  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">LARA MARLOWE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IF I had a son,  president Barack Obama said yesterday,  he d look like Trayvon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photographs of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old African-American who was shot dead in Florida on February 26th, have been in the news all week. It s true he looked a lot like the young Barack Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case prompted vigils and marches in a half-dozen US cities this week. Yesterday was the first time the president commented on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said it was  absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this . . . All of us have to do some soul searching to figure out how does something like this happen .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of his death, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was walking through the retreat at Twin Lakes, a gated community that had seen a rash of burglaries, on the way to his father s home. It was raining, and he wore a hoodie. The young man was popular at school, where he earned As and Bs, and had no police record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He carried a can of iced tea and a package of Skittles sweets he d just bought at the local 7-Eleven.  This dude is following me,  Martin told his girlfriend on his mobile phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, the 28-year-old son of a retired white military man and a Peruvian woman, cruised the streets of the community in his SUV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Neighbourhood Watch member who aspired to become a police officer, Zimmerman had placed 46 calls to the emergency 911 number in 14 months, reporting open windows and  suspicious  individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though he d been accused of criminal misconduct and violence twice in 2005, Zimmerman holds a concealed weapons permit and carried a semiautomatic handgun the night Martin died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin s girlfriend told him to run. Zimmerman ignored the police dispatcher on 911 who told him not to pursue Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why are you following me?  the girlfriend heard Martin say, then another voice asking:  What are you doing in the neighbourhood?  She heard yelling and the line died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin s dead body was found in the street. Zimmerman told police he was heading back to his car when Martin attacked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Zimmerman s head and neck were bleeding. They conducted drug and alcohol tests on Martin, but not on Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They let Zimmerman keep his handgun and later said they did not arrest him because he claimed self-defence, as allowed by Florida s lenient  Stand Your Ground  law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-one states have similar laws.  You want to know how you can kill somebody legally in Florida?  Arthur Hayhoe of the Florida Coalition to Stop Gun Violence told USA Today.  Make sure you have no witnesses, hunt the person down and then say you feared for your life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What started as a local story has grown into a national outrage. Celebrities including film director Spike Lee and actor Mia Farrow, prominent African-Americans such as Martin Luther King III, Rev Al Sharpton and congressman John Lewis, spoke out. Some 900,000 people signed an online petition calling for Zimmerman s arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Lee, the Sanford police chief, stepped down temporarily on Thursday. Florida governor Rick Scott named a new prosecutor and called a grand jury to decide next month whether Zimmerman should be arrested. Attorney general Eric Holder opened a federal investigation and discussed Martin s death with black religious leaders at the White House yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were echoes of decades past, when the lynching of black men in southern states was tolerated by local authorities who resented the meddling of federal marshals. The 1955 precedent of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American from Chicago who may have made the mistake of whistling at a white woman while visiting relatives in Mississippi, is cited often.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Till was dragged from his bed by two white men who shot him dead and dumped his body in the river. Till s killers were cleared by an all-white jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2012, as Eugene Robinson of the Washington Post notes,  it is ridiculous to imply that nothing has changed.  Mississippi has more elected black officials than any other state. A black family inhabit the White House, and the attorney general is also black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a post-racial society remains a mirage. Black men still go through life wearing a bull s-eye, Robinson says. In 2009, the last time president Obama commented on a racially charged incident   after the Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates jnr was arrested in his own home   he mentioned the  long history of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African-Americans allude to the offence of  driving while black . Since Trayvon&nbsp;Martin s death, they speak of the danger of  walking while black . Protesters wear hoodies or T-shirts saying  I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,  and carry iced tea and Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressure for the arrest of George Zimmerman is mounting. Two questions hang over race relations in America. If Trayvon&nbsp;Martin were white, would he have been shot? If George Zimmerman were black, would he have been arrested?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US president Barack Obama has said if he had a son he would look like 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot dead in a Florida suburb. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As outrage about the case dominates the US media and has rallied civil rights activists, Mr Obama said the country had much soul-searching to do and &quot;every aspect&quot; of the shooting should be investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Martin was shot in the Orlando suburb of Sanford on February 26 by a neighbourhood watch security volunteer George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman (28) was not charged by police because he said he was acting in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the teenager is said to have been carrying at the time of his death was an iced tea and a pack of sweets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rallies have been held in Florida and New York this week to demand justice for Mr Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in personal terms, the president expressed sympathy for Mr Martin's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can only imagine what these parents are going through and when I think about this boy I think about my own kids,&quot; Mr Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aiming his message at Mr Martin's parents, he said: &quot;If I had a son he'd look like Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans to take this with the seriousness that it deserves and we're going to get to the bottom of what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this and everybody pulls together, federal state and local, to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What happened to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is a tragedy,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;There needs to be a thorough investigation that reassures the public that justice is carried out with impartiality and integrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, a law known as &quot;stand your ground&quot; can prevent criminal or civil prosecution when someone is killed in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The justice department and FBI have opened a civil rights investigation and a jury is considering whether to charge Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Martin's parents, civil rights activists and others who have rallied to the cause say they will not be satisfied until Mr Zimmerman is arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighbourhood watch man had told a police dispatcher he thought Mr Martin looked suspicious when he saw him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A confrontation followed after which Mr Zimmerman shot Mr Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police chief Bill Lee stepped down temporarily this week to try to cool the growing anger that his department had not arrested Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours later, Governor Rick Scott announced that the local state attorney, Norman Wolfinger, had withdrawn from the case in hopes of &quot;toning down the rhetoric&quot; surrounding it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BARACK Obama stepped into the controversy over the shooting of an unarmed black teenager last night amid fears the killing could cause race riots across the U.S. Black leaders demanded justice as angry protests by thousands of demonstrators threatened to boil over into violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, was shot dead by an over-zealous neighbourhood watch volunteer when he went out to buy a bag of Skittles near his Florida home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting happened nearly a month ago, but the Hispanic gunman is still free, claiming he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton and the teenager's family have led demands for the arrest of 28-year-old George Zimmerman, claiming the killing was racially motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an attempt to defuse the tension, President Obama made an emotional plea for America to do some 'soul searching' over the tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,' said Mr Obama, a father of two daughters, Malia, 13, and Sasha, ten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke out after coming under attack from some black leaders for failing to comment on a case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,' said Mr Obama at the White House. 'Every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pull together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Obviously, this is a tragedy. I can only imagine what these parents are going through. All of us have to do some soul searching to figure out how something like this has happened.' Students in at least eight Florida schools walked out in protest yesterday and more demonstrations are planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the police chief in Sanford, Florida, where the shooting happened, stepped down because of the widespread condemnation of his failure to arrest Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the shooting, Mr Zimmerman was heard on a police radio dispatcher's tape saying he was following the teenager on February 26. 'This guy looks like he's up to no good ... these ****holes always get away,' he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from the outrage over the killing of the unarmed teen, people are questioning why George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer and the man accused of killing martin, was armed to begin with. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're setting yourself up for failure if you're confronting someone if you don't know if they are armed, unarmed and you have a gun and are prepared to shoot them&quot;, said Samantha Jackson.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The point is watch, neighborhood watch -- not neighborhood approach, neighborhood question. So if I see someone suspicious, I'm going to pass it on to the police. I'm not going to take it upon myself to confront the person&quot;, said Jessica Guilbeaux.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Forney, the case is being followed by many of the people who live here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There should have been something else that was done. And not a child who's young and doing nothing getting killed or hurt. i think it's ridiculous&quot;, said Forney resident Karla Bowden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forney has an active neighborhood watch with several volunteers. Bowden believes they should have some means of protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think that they should have guns but I think they should be armed with something to where they would be able to have a response to somebody if somebody came up and they were armed or if they were trying to hurt them&quot;, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watch volunteers in Forney are not allowed to carry weapons while on patrol even if they have a concealed hand gun license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The biggest issue we would have is we don't want law enforcement being handled by those that aren't trained to do it&quot;, said Forney City Manager Brian Brooks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers are given radios to call in any suspicious activity to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a trained and capable law enforcement community and our officers are best able to handle it&quot;, Brooks said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, black Americans mobilized to elect one of their own president of the United States. When asked, the overwhelming majority of black Americans still say they support Barack Obama. But the old enthusiasm has dwindled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic crisis of 2008 hit black America hard, and the recovery since 2009 has largely passed black America by. Black unemployment rates look like something out of the Great Depression: Almost half of young black men cannot find work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cool, cerebral Obama does not much comfort or inspire those out of work, black or white. He is not an &quot;I feel your pain&quot; kind of politician. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While nobody doubts that Obama will carry 90% or more of the black vote in November, a lot of people have wondered how high the black turnout will be. If dispirited black Americans stay home in large numbers, Obama's re-election challenge becomes that much greater. But what could possibly inspire them to the polls?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer may have just arrived - in the tragic form of the killing of a teenaged boy, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three weeks ago, young Martin was shot and killed by a neighbourhood watch volunteer in a gated community in the town of Sanford, Florida. Martin was black, the volunteer was of white-Hispanic background. Martin was unarmed. He was 100 pounds lighter than his killer. At the time of the shooting, he was walking back to the house in which he was staying, talking on his cellphone, and carrying a bag of candy he had just bought at a nearby store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more details emerge, the more it looks as if Martin was hunted and killed by a trigger-happy bully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet local police have not arrested the killer. No charges have been laid. The killer claimed to have acted in selfdefence, and despite many problems in his story - including the killer's own violent history - the police opted to believe him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like nothing else since 2009, the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case has jolted black America. Tens of thousands of people have signed digital petitions demanding a federal investigation. Demonstrations have begun to take place in Florida and elsewhere. A community that has had much reason since 2009 to ask, &quot;Why bother with politics?&quot; suddenly has found an answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's killer, George Zimmerman, could plead self-defence because of Florida's peculiar gun laws. Under the old law inherited by the English speaking world, an armed man has a &quot;duty to retreat.&quot; Not in Florida. In 2005, Florida adopted what's called a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law. These laws - increasingly common in southern states - permit an armed man to shoot in self-defence even if he could have avoided the fight without shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stand your ground&quot; laws become especially lethal when combined with other new laws that grant people in the majority of U.S. states the right to carry weapons in public, and even concealed weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. gun laws have become more permissive even as U.S. crime rates have sharply declined. Why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can read the answer on the past four years' worth of front pages on the hugely popular website, the Drudge Report. Month in, month out, Drudge spotlights gruesome black-on-white crimes. In a country of 300 million people, there are always examples. These same stories circulate in e-mail chains - and often become the focus of local rightwing talk-radio shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. journalist Mickey Kaus calls it &quot;under-news&quot;: news that never quite emerges into the national media, but that shapes the consciousness of millions of people. And what is being shaped is a conviction among many white people - especially fearful elderly whites in the South - that the Obama presidency has licensed a rampage of black-on-white violence. That's not what the statistics say. But as Stephen Colbert would say: statistics are elitist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is so often the case, Rush Limbaugh gave these new racial fears their most explicit voice. In September 2009, after Drudge publicized an assault on an Illinois school bus, Limbaugh had this to say: &quot;It's Obama's America, is it not? Obama's America - white kids getting beat up on school buses now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This mood of &quot;backlash&quot; has dominated U.S. politics since 2009 - until now. Now the &quot;backlash&quot; has created an apparent martyr in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. And it is in Martin's name that the backlash against the backlash will be launched and be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You think the 2012 election will be about economics? Think again.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manama, Bahrain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE very public controversy surrounding the killing on Feb. 26 of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old, by a crime watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, was predictable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, I, along with other Florida chiefs of police, said so in a letter to the Legislature in 2005 when we opposed the passage of a law that not only enshrined the doctrine of ''your home is your castle'' but took this doctrine into the public square and added a new concept called ''stand your ground.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Use-of-force issues arose often during my 41-year policing career. In fact, officer-involved shootings were the No. 1 problem when I became Miami's police chief in January 2003. But after we put in place new policies and training, officers went 20 months without discharging a single bullet at a person, while arrests increased over 30 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trying to control shootings by members of a well-trained and disciplined police department is a daunting enough task. Laws like ''stand your ground'' give citizens unfettered power and discretion with no accountability. It is a recipe for disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time the Florida law was working its way through the Legislature, proponents argued that a homeowner should have the absolute right to defend himself and his home against an intruder and should not have to worry about the legal consequences if he killed someone. Proponents also maintained that there should be no judicial review of such a shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I pointed out at the time that even a police officer is held to account for every single bullet he or she discharges, so why should a private citizen be given more rights when it came to using deadly physical force? I also asked the bill's sponsor, State Representative Dennis K. Baxley, to point to any case in Florida where a homeowner had been indicted or arrested as a result of ''defending his castle.'' He could not come up with a single one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only thing that is worse than a bad law is an unnecessary law. Clearly, this was the case here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second part of the law -- ''stand your ground'' -- is the most problematic. Until 2005, in all 50 states, the law on the use of force for civilians was pretty simple. If you found yourself in a situation where you felt threatened but could safely retreat, you had the duty to do so. (A police officer does not have the duty to retreat; that is the distinction between a sworn police officer and the average citizen regarding use of force.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officers are trained to de-escalate highly charged encounters with aggressive people, using deadly force as a last resort. Citizens, on the other hand, may act from emotion and perceived threats. But ''stand your ground'' gives citizens the right to use force in public if they feel threatened. As the law emphatically states, a citizen has ''no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During one debate, one of the law's proponents suggested that if a citizen felt threatened in a public space, he should not have to retreat and should be able to meet force with force. I pointed out that citizens feel threatened all the time, whether it's from the approach of an aggressive panhandler or squeegee pest or even just walking down a poorly lighted street at night. In tightly congested urban areas, public encounters can be threatening; a look, a physical bump, a leer, someone you think may be following you. This is part of urban life. You learn to navigate threatening settings without resorting to force. Retreating is always the best option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Florida police chiefs predicted in 2005, the law has been used to justify killings ranging from drug dealers' turf battles to road rage incidents. Homicides categorized as justifiable have nearly tripled since the law went into effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in 2005, the National Rifle Association identified about two dozen states as fertile ground for the passage of laws just like this one. Florida was the first state to pass such a law. Today, at least 20 other states have followed suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Rick Scott of Florida can make all Floridians proud by being the first governor to reject and repeal such misguided laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President Obama did not mention race even as he addressed it on Friday, instead letting his person and his words say it all: ''If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weighing in for the first time on the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot and killed a month ago in Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer, Mr. Obama in powerfully personal terms deplored the ''tragedy'' and, as a parent, expressed sympathy for the boy's mother and father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I can only imagine what these parents are going through. And when I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Every parent in America,'' he added, ''should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this and that everybody pulls together -- federal, state and local -- to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While speaking movingly from his perspective as the father of two girls, one a teenager, Mr. Obama notably made no reference to the racial context that has made the killing of Trayvon and the gunman's claim of self-defense a rallying point for African-Americans. Since Mr. Obama first began campaigning to be ''president of all the people,'' as his advisers would put it when pressed on racial issues, he has been generally reluctant to talk about race. And after his historic election as the first black president, Mr. Obama learned the hard way about the pitfalls of the chief executive opining on law enforcement matters involving civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His remark at a news conference in the summer of 2009 that a white police officer in Cambridge, Mass., had acted ''stupidly'' in arresting a black Harvard law professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr., at his home led to a national controversy that ended with Mr. Obama holding a peacemaking ''beer summit'' with the two men at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until Friday, Mr. Obama had refrained from commenting on the death of Trayvon, 17, a high school student who was killed on the night of Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla., near Orlando. George Zimmerman, 28, the neighborhood watch volunteer, said he fired at Trayvon in self-defense, although there is no apparent evidence that the teenager, who held only a bag of Skittles candy and an iced tea, was doing anything wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when a reporter asked about the case at a White House event introducing Jim Yong Kim as his choice to be president of the World Bank, Mr. Obama, who typically leaves such events ignoring the shouted questions of reporters, seemed prepared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It was inevitable given the high-profile nature of this story that he would be asked about it,'' his press secretary, Jay Carney, said later. He added that Mr. Obama ''had thought about it and was prepared to answer that question when he got it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Carney himself had refused for days to speak for Mr. Obama about Trayvon's death, and other advisers on Friday likewise declined to weigh in on the thinking at the White House about the case and its repercussions. Mr. Obama's mostly white male inner circle has long been reluctant to talk for their boss when the subject is race, given how personal it is for him. One aide, speaking only on the grounds of anonymity, said that there was no internal debate about how to respond to Trayvon's death, but that Mr. Obama wanted to await the Justice Department's initial review of the case and the announcement this week by his attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., that the civil rights division would investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his remarks, Mr. Obama endorsed the Justice Department investigation as well as efforts by local and state agencies in Florida to examine the circumstances of the shooting. Trayvon's parents ''are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened,'' Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president indicated his caution in not reacting earlier was due to the hazards of addressing an issue under inquiry. ''I'm the head of the executive branch and the attorney general reports to me so I've got to be careful about my statements to make sure that we're not impairing any investigation that's taking place right now,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader who organized a rally on Thursday night in Florida protesting the handling of the case and has been working with the Martin family, praised Mr. Obama's comments and took issue with black critics who say the president should have spoken out sooner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're trying to win a case, not just have the president make high-profile statements,'' Mr. Sharpton said in an interview. ''As one who's been with the family, the president making a statement before the Justice Department announced an investigation could have been used by Zimmerman to say the White House was pre-judging a legal case.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles J. Ogletree, an African-American law professor at Harvard who taught Mr. Obama there and remains a confidant, said there was no doubt the president had been moved by Trayvon's death. ''Nothing is more frightening for a parent than losing a child,'' Professor Ogletree said. ''I know personally that he felt this pain, from the moment he was made aware of the case.'' He added: ''He has two young daughters. This is personal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Carney said he could not say whether Mr. Obama planned to call Trayvon's parents, as some black activists have urged. Boyce D. Watkins, a Syracuse University professor and the founder of the Your Black World coalition, said Friday in a Twitter message, ''If Trayvon's mother were white, would Obama give her a call?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Watkins, in an interview, called Mr. Obama's statement ''a step in the right direction,'' but added that the president could ''squash a great deal of the criticism'' with a call to the parents. And while applauding Mr. Obama's comment that his own son would look like Trayvon, Dr. Watkins said the president's remarks were characteristic of how Mr. Obama talks to black people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That's what I would refer to as a standard political smoke signal that President Obama sends through the back door to the black community,'' Dr. Watkins said. ''He communicates to the black community in code language. That's a subtle way of saying, 'I know this kid is black.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's comments appeared to prompt several of the Republicans campaigning to run against him to weigh in against the shooting for the first time. Both Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum said that based on what they knew, Florida's ''Stand Your Ground'' self-defense law should not apply in Mr. Zimmerman's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking publicly for the first time on Friday evening, Craig A. Sonner, Mr. Zimmerman's lawyer, said on CNN that he would not use the Stand Your Ground defense should his client be charged in the shooting. He said he would use self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum, campaigning at a shooting range in Louisiana, which holds a presidential primary on Saturday, called the decision of local officials not to immediately prosecute Mr. Zimmerman ''another chilling example of horrible decisions made by people in this process.'' Mitt Romney, the Republican front-runner, told reporters in Louisiana that the shooting was ''a terrible tragedy, unnecessary, uncalled for and inexplicable at this point.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. And I think [his parents] are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.' - President Obama yesterday </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WASHINGTON - President Obama yesterday cast a national spotlight on the racially charged killing of unarmed black teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, telling the nation, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taking a rare personal tack, Obama took on the wrenching Florida case during an unrelated Rose Garden ceremony - stopping unexpectedly to answer a reporter's question about the shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama said he wanted to choose his words carefully to avoid &quot;impairing&quot; the Justice Department investigation into the shooting of the 17-year-old boy by a white neighborhood-watch volunteer last month in Sanford, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;But my main message is to the parents of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said. &quot;And I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it &shy;deserves, and that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added solemnly, &quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president usually walks away from the podium without answering questions after events like yesterday's announcement of his nominee to lead the World Bank. But this time, Obama fielded the question, which he was well prepared to answer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By weighing in, the country's first black president not only made it personal but drew &shy;national attention to what had been a Florida controversy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The teen was shot dead the night of Feb. 28 by George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old man of mixed white and Hispanic ethnicity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman has claimed self-defense and has not been &shy;arrested. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trayvon had been visiting relatives in Sanford and was on his way back to their home from a &shy;7-Eleven, carrying only a bag of Skittles and a can of Arizona Iced Tea and wearing a hoodie, when he was shot dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The killing and muted police response spurred huge rallies and protests, as prominent black leaders charged that police would have treated the case differently if Trayvon had been white. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee &shy;resigned temporarily this week, saying the blaring criticism of his handling of the case had become a distraction from the investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The hoodie has emerged as a symbol of the unjust stereotype that has been placed on black teens like Trayvon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Supporters have donned hoodies at rallies, and NBA stars LeBron James and Dwyane Wade and their Miami Heat teammates, as well as Knick star Carmelo &shy;Anthony, have posted photos of themselves wearing hoodies on Twitter in a gesture of solidarity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Knicks forward Amar'e Stoudemire - a Central Florida native - arrived in Toronto yesterday wearing a hooded sweater in tribute to Martin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The national outcry prompted Justice Department prosecutors and the FBI to open an investigation this week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Well, I'm the head of the Executive Branch, and the attorney general reports to me, so I've got to be careful about my statements to make sure that we're not impairing any investigation that's taking place right now,&quot; Obama said in the Rose Garden. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;But obviously this is a tragedy. I can only imagine what these parents are going through,&quot; the president said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pulls together - federal, state and local - to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama continued, &quot;So I'm glad that not only is the Justice Department looking into it, I understand now that the governor of the state of Florida has formed a task force to investigate what's taking place.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think all of us have to do some soul-searching to figure out how does something like this happen. And that means that &shy;we examine the laws and the context for what happened, as well as the specifics of the incident.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president's personal intervention only increased pressure for speedy action from Florida Gov. Rick Scott, state Attorney General Pam Bondi and the special prosecutor they appointed Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Travyon's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, &shy;issued a statement after Obama spoke. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The president's personal comments touched us deeply and made us wonder: If his son looked liked Trayvon and wore a hoodie, would he be suspicious, too?&quot; the statement read. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We'd like to thank the president and the millions of people from around the world who have shown their support for Trayvon.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman's father, Robert Zimmerman, defended his son in a recent letter to the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, writing, &quot;He would be the last to discriminate for any reason whatsoever.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Craig Sonner, Zimmerman's attorney, told CNN that his client shot Martin in self-defense after a fight. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I don't believe that George Zimmerman's a racist or that this was motivated by a dislike for African-Americans,&quot; Sonner said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also yesterday, Zimmerman broke his almost month-long silence and left a message on his strongest supporter's voicemail, according to MSNBC.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I wanted to thank you for doing everything you've been doing,&quot; Zimmerman said in the rambling message he left for Frank Taaffe, a former block captain in the gated community.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 24--Supporters of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a Florida high school student who was fatally shot, demanded justice for the 17-year-old on Saturday morning at Peninsula Park in North Portland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hoodies up,&quot; a speaker shouted from a stage, prompting the crowd to flip their sweatshirt hoods over their heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The act of pulling over a hood has become a symbol in memory of Martin, who was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when he died Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla. George Zimmerman, a self-appointed neighborhood watch captain, reportedly told Florida police he shot the teen out of self-defense. Zimmerman has not been arrested and is not charged with a crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has stirred, and enraged, many across the country about race and justice. A petition to arrest and prosecute Zimmerman has drawn more than 1.7 million signatures on Change.org. Rallies have been held nationwide in Martin's honor. NBA players from the Miami Heat tweeted a photo of the team in black hooded sweatshirts, their heads bowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday in Portland, the crowd intermittently chanted &quot;no justice, no peace&quot; during a series of speeches in solidarity with the family of the slain teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Hill, a 31-year-old mother of five kids in Southeast Portland, was angry when she learned of Martin's death. &quot;It was in my heart for a week,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill and her friend Teressa Raiford, a candidate for Portland city commissioner, created a Facebook page to spread the word of Saturday's event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin has changed my life,&quot; said Hill, who was wearing a red hooded sweatshirt. &quot;I will never be idle again. I will never be uninvolved again. You have to speak up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill and other guest speakers, speaking through a megaphone at the south end of the park, asked the community to consider how racism still exists in our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've always had the issue of racism, the fear of racists, the fear of black people,&quot; said Raiford, 41. &quot;We just didn't have an outlet to get that discussion out. But once you understand, you no longer fear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many saw Martin's case as a cue to inform young African American men about the ways they could be perceived because of the color of their skin. Other speakers likened the impact and national attention of Martin's case to that of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African American boy who was killed in Mississippi in 1955, when the American civil rights movement was just beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill said she hopes more young men will be encouraged to pursue education. She said she recently asked a group of students, when they graduate, to consider wearing a white T-shirt that has words in remembrance of Martin, whose chance at high school graduation was cut short.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deshawn Hardy, of Happy Valley, said he learned about the event on Facebook and came out in support of Martin's family. When Hardy was asked about the impact of Martin's case on African American young men such as his son, he said he just teaches his son the wisdom to know what's right, like anybody else. &quot;Even though we do live in Happy Valley and not in the inner-city (of Portland), you have to stand up for what's right and be respectful,&quot; Hardy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blake Dye, a supporter who stood behind the guest speakers on the stage, said a meeting has been planned on Tuesday at Self Enhancement, Inc. for African American men and boys to come together and try to figure out next steps for their community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard to conceptualize this case,&quot; Dye said. &quot;We hope to generate conversations about what we tell our children.&quot; The meeting starts at 6 p.m. and is open to the general public, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fred Bryant, father of 25-year-old Keaton Otis who was shot and killed by Portland police last May, said he understood the pain of Martin's family. Bryant wore a bag of Skittles around his neck to symbolize one of the few items Martin had on him when he died. Bryant was upset with &quot;the justification of taking our young people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's death is an example of an issue that has touched and drawn people from all different communities, regardless of race, said Rev. LeRoy Haynes, of the Albina Ministerial Alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's up to the people who love justice, equity and freedom to say we're not going to back down and accept racial discrimination and injustice,&quot; Haynes said. &quot;We hope that we can also put this energy in a constructive manner of our Portland Police Bureau and our Portland community.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several thousand people marched Friday night from 30th Street Station to JFK Plaza as part of the &quot;Million Hoodie March&quot; to support the family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a black Florida teenager shot to death last month by a Neighborhood Watch volunteer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The march along John F. Kennedy Boulevard began at 7:17 p.m. - the time when police found Martin's body Feb. 26 at the scene in Sanford, Fla.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're trying to bring awareness about the injustice that's going on in Florida, the streets of Philly, and other cities in America,&quot; said Jason Moody, 32, of #OnTheCornerstone(d), an online radio station and community-organizing group that put together the march. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the participants wore hooded sweatshirts in support of Martin, who was wearing one at the time of his death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said about 2,500 people started the march, which swelled as it proceeded into the heart of Center City. Final police estimates for the number of participants ranged from 5,000 to 8,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No arrests were reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, had gone to a 7-Eleven and was walking back to his gated community to watch a basketball game when George Zimmerman, a Neighborhood Watch volunteer, followed and shot him. Zimmerman contended that he shot Martin in self-defense and was released by police after questioning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philadelphia was the latest city to have a march in response to the shooting and how the police handled the aftermath. On Wednesday, protesters gathered in New York and Miami to call for the arrest of Zimmerman and to support Martin's family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Friday's march, people chanted: &quot;Do I look suspicious? I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a brother that's 12. We let him explore. This could've been my own brother,&quot; Quay Coles, 21, of Folcroft, said before the march. &quot;Though this took place states away, there are people with the same mind-set in this city.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andre McEachin, 52, of North Philadelphia, was upset that Zimmerman could plead self-defense and not face criminal charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If your life was at stake, maybe I could understand. But to kill an unarmed child is a world of difference,&quot; McEachin said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not just for blacks,&quot; he said. &quot;If someone doesn't like you because you have a hoodie on, it could be you. Justice and equality, that's the American dream. Doesn't say anything about what color you are.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the march, a man was handing out Skittles, the candy Martin had bought at the convenience store. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, City Councilwoman Blondell Reynolds Brown placed the shooting within the larger dialogue about race in America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; 'Existing while black' for African American boys means that everywhere they go, there are hidden land mines that could go off at any given moment at unexpected times and places,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, he unknowingly stepped on one of those land mines on the way home to watch an [NBA] basketball game, like so many of his peers.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moody, the organizer, maintained: &quot;The march is not a race thing. It's about injustice - everyone goes through that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a peaceful gathering - we don't want to clash with the police like they did in New York,&quot; he said. &quot;But we don't want teenagers to be scared to go to the corner store, either. We want our voices heard.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonah EtShalom, 28, of West Philadelphia, said Martin's shooting was &quot;symptomatic of a broader problem of institutionalized racism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this country, people of color - especially young black men - are killed and institutionalized at such large and problematic numbers that need to change,&quot; she said. &quot;No one should be assumed to be criminal because they're black.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carmena Ayo-Davies, 28, who helped Moody stage the march, said she hoped the event would unite the Greater Philadelphia community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all stand together as people. Killings are rising in major cities,&quot; said Ayo-Davies, who runs a local marketing agency. &quot;It's time to put our hoodies and sneakers on and come together for a very good cause. All walks of life are standing with us. This is open to all - not just African Americans and minorities.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania lawmakers and activists studied Florida's law governing citizens' right to use deadly force before crafting last year's expansion to this state's &quot;Castle Doctrine&quot; statute. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal shooting of an unarmed teenager there by a neighborhood watch captain who claimed self-defense has focused intense national debate on such laws as critics on both sides of the gun control debate call for charges against the shooter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What that man is accused of doing, by following that kid, confronting him and then shooting him, all because he thought he was suspicious -- that isn't what the Castle Doctrine was intended for,&quot; said Kim Stolfer of McDonald, chair of Firearm Owners Against Crime.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stolfer, a gun-rights activist who helped legislators craft Pennsylvania's law, does not think authorities should allow George Zimmerman of Sanford, Fla., to invoke the law in defense of shooting Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These Castle Doctrine laws are a ticking time bomb, and it's only a matter of time before Pennsylvania has a Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case,&quot; said Max Nacheman, director of the gun violence prevention group CeaseFirePA. &quot;These laws should be referred to as 'Shoot first, ask questions later.' &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania's law, which Gov. Tom Corbett signed in June, expanded the right to use deadly force without retreat outside a person's home to his or her car, yard or any other location where he or she is legally allowed to be. Somerset County prosecutors cited the law in December when they decided not to charge a man who fatally shot his wife's lover outside his home with a compound bow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors initially opposed expanding the law in 2009, according to Rich Long, executive director of the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association in Harrisburg. They successfully lobbied to add language to the law, including a provision that the person doing the shooting had to be in legal possession of the gun and that a weapon must clearly be displayed for someone to believe his or her life is in imminent danger. Those provisions are not in the Florida law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania's law also encourages, but does not require, the shooter to retreat first. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty states have Castle Doctrine laws. Of those, Florida is among more than 20 with &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws, which give a person broader latitude when deciding whether to react with deadly force and place the burden of proof on prosecutors, said University of Pittsburgh law professor David Harris. Florida in 2005 was the first state to explicitly expand a person's right to use deadly force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris thinks lawmakers should review or rescind the laws. &quot;This will not end up as an isolated case,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators held angry protests across Florida this week over the Feb. 26 killing, and outrage is spreading nationally. Martin, who was black, was shot in Sanford, a suburb of Orlando, while walking back to his father's house after buying a package of Skittles candy and a bottle of iced tea at a convenience store. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 28, a white Hispanic, was patrolling the community when he called 911 and reported a man acting suspiciously, police said. Zimmerman followed Martin, and a confrontation ensued, during which Zimmerman shot the teenager once. Agencies including the Department of Justice are reviewing the incident. President Obama has urged a close investigation of the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Carnegie Mellon University Black Graduate Student Organization will demonstrate at 12:30 p.m. Monday on the campus along Forbes Avenue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The law was intended to protect you if your life is in danger, so that you don't turn around and get sued by the family of the person who was trying to kill you,&quot; Stolfer said. &quot;Mr. Zimmerman needs to be arrested, and this law doesn't deserve to be sacrificed for his actions.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Pennsylvania's law is not as broad as in other states, it has come up in a few cases. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somerset County prosecutors cited it in not prosecuting Carl Wooley Jr. for fatally shooting Tony Bittinger with a compound bow. At the time, District Attorney Jerry Spangler said that Bittinger came to Wooley's house armed with a bat and that the law allowed Wooley to respond with deadly force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Westmoreland County, lawyers cited the expanded Castle Doctrine as prosecutors investigated a road rage shooting incident in Ligonier Township in October. Prosecutors ultimately withdrew charges against Charles Gallow of Ligonier but cited the victim's refusal to testify as the reason. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">District attorneys in Butler, Somerset, Washington and Westmoreland counties did not return phone messages and emails seeking comment. Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. said there have been no cases in the county invoking the Castle Doctrine as a defense since its expansion. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stoudemire wanted to show his support for the protests in the wake  of the fatal shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last month by a community  watchman. Part of the reasoning for the shooting was that the  17-year-old was threatening because he was wearing a hoodie.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I mean, it's just a matter of us understanding that we all have to  be positive influences on the community,&quot; said Stoudemire, who grew  up in Orlando, just 20 minutes from Sanford, Fla., where the  shooting occurred. &quot;If you're going to be a watchman, be a positive  watchman in the community. I think it's all about uplifting the  community and keeping everybody together for a positive message.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Florida state representative Alan Williams sent out a request via  twitter to Stoudemire, along with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and  Chris Paul to wear hoodies during warm-ups at their games. But  Stoudemire said he had not seen that and chose to do this on his  own.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Stoudemire posted a photo on his Twitter account, @Amareisreal,  wearing a sweater with a hood and declaring that he had his hoodie  on. Carmelo Anthony also posted a photo of himself wearing one with  the words, &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; Wade posted a photo of himself  with a hoodie and spoke out about it, and James then posted a Heat  team photo with the entire group wearing hoodies.   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid mounting public outrage, the Justice Department is stepping in to scrutinize the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin last month in Florida. The scrutiny is appropriate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was shot by George Zimmerman, a member of the neighborhood watch in the Sanford community on a rainy night after Zimmerman had dialed 911 and reported that Martin was acting suspiciously and then running away. The dispatcher said a patrol car would arrive and instructed Zimmerman not to pursue the young man. Within minutes, Zimmerman had fatally shot Martin, who was unarmed. Martin's family and friends dispute Zimmerman's characterization of him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Zimmerman has not been arrested, perhaps in part because of Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which allows citizens to use deadly force in self-defense even without exhausting other options first. A single tragedy cannot invalidate all of the reasons such laws have been passed, but there are enough questions about Martin's death that a thorough examination is not only warranted but imperative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further information might exonerate Zimmerman of any intentional wrongdoing. But if he did indeed gun down an innocent young man in cold blood, he must not be allowed to get away with it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 24--AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- On the day President Obama commented for the first time on the fatal shooting of unarmed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Sanford, Miami Heat players, including Dwyane Wade and LeBron James, injected themselves into the conversation with powerful visual statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was shot a month ago after a confrontation in a gated community with neighborhood-watch captain George Zimmerman, with the youth's body discovered Feb. 26. Zimmerman, who has claimed he shot Martin in self-defense, has not been charged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was wearing a &quot;hoodie&quot; hooded sweatshirt when he was shot, which has added to the debate about racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, Wade on Friday posted to his Facebook page a picture of him wearing a hoodie. On his Twitter account, he simply posted, &quot;#hoodies #stereotype #trayvonmartin&quot; with a link to the photograph of himself wearing a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, James posted a picture on his Twitter account of the Heat team in hooded sweatshirts, taken at the team hotel following Friday morning's practice, with the Twitter post, &quot;#WeAreTrayvonMartin #Hoodies #Stereotyped #WeWantJustice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various rallies held in support of Martin have asked participants to wear hoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a father,&quot; Wade told the South Florida Sun Sentinel. &quot;It's support of the tragic thing that has taken place. No matter what color, race, we're all fathers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you think about what that family's going through, it hits you hard and it hurts your heart to think about it. Just anything you can do, obviously we can't bring him back, but anything you can do to get behind and support is what we're doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That led James to gather his teammates for the group photo in the team-logo sweatshirts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a powerful statement today after shootaround and back at the hotel by our team,&quot; coach Erik Spoelstra said of the photo session. &quot;And it really is a tragic story. And the more you learn about it, the more confused you get. But for them to come together, to draw more light on the subject, I think is a powerful move, and we all stand behind them, not only the staff, but the Miami Heat organization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team issued a statement standing by the photo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our hearts go out to the family and loved ones of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin for their loss and for everyone involved in this terrible tragedy,&quot; the statement read. &quot;We support our players and join them in hoping that their images and our logo can be part of the national dialogue and can help in our nation's healing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances hit home with many Heat players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it humbled a lot of us, because a majority of us have kids of our own,&quot; forward Udonis Haslem said. &quot;A lot of us have little boys and I couldn't imagine if my son went to the store just to get some Skittles and a pop or an iced tea and didn't come home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Heat players wore messages of memoriam for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on their sneakers during Friday's game against the Detroit Pistons at the Palace of Auburn Hills, with one on James' shoe reading, &quot;RIP Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; while Chris Bosh wore &quot;We Want Justice&quot; on his sneaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In advance of the team photo, Wade said he felt it was the perfect time to present the photo of him in the hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a picture that I've taken before. I thought it was great opportunity to use it,&quot; he said. &quot;I've never used it before, really. So that was a great opportunity to use it. Just to get the people to understand what we're in support of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wade, a father of two, said he felt it imperative to enter the conversation. His girlfriend, actress Gabrielle Union, had already voiced her outrage over the handling of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We discussed it,&quot; Wade said. &quot;I only start doing something when I find out more information on it. Early on, I didn't hear the [911] call, I didn't have a lot of information. So I wasn't going to just jump into it. She knew a lot early on about everything. That's why she was very vocal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only Heat players not in the team &quot;hoodie&quot; photograph released through James' Twitter account were forward Mike Miller, who is not traveling with the team due to an ankle injury, and forward Shane Battier, who is from the Detroit area and was at lunch with his in-laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Battier said he stood by the message.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GOLF:&lt;/b&gt; Tiger Woods is in a place he hasn't been in 30 months - atop the leaderboard on the PGA Tour going into the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With alarming control, Woods putted for birdie on every hole and made short work of the par 5s Friday at Bay Hill for a 7-under-par 65, giving him a share of the lead with Charlie Wi after two rounds of the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Orlando, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wi rolled in a 25-foot birdie putt on his last hole for a 68 to join Woods at 10-under 134.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Pernice Jr. off to strong start at Fallen Oaks:&lt;/b&gt; In his first Champions Tour event this year, Tom Pernice Jr. was 7 under through 12 holes before play was suspended because of darkness at the Mississippi Gulf Resort Classic began play at Fallen Oaks in Saucier, Miss. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Tseng leads Kia Classic:&lt;/b&gt; Top-ranked Yani Tseng shot a 4-under 68 to open a two-stroke lead over Se Ri Pak after the second round of the LPGA's Kia Classic in Carlsbad, Calif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tseng, tied for the first-round lead after a 67, had a 9-under 135 total on La Costa's Legends Course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wendy Ward of Edwall, Wash., missed the cut by one stroke, closing the second round with a 74.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;b&gt;SHAW BEATS ASHLAND FOR NCAA D-II TITLE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WOMEN'S BASKETBALL:&lt;/b&gt; Sequoyah Griffin scored 24 points and Shaw (29-6) rallied to win its first national title, beating Ashland (33-2) 88-82 in overtime in the NCAA Division II championship game in San Antonio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;b&gt;HEAT ADD VOICES TO SHOOTING PROTEST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NBA:&lt;/b&gt; LeBron James and Dwyane Wade were among several Miami players who took the floor against the Detroit Pistons at Auburn Hills, Mich., with messages on their sneakers about the death of an unarmed black teenager who was shot by a neighborhood crime-watch volunteer in a suburb of Orlando, Fla. The Heat made quick work of the Pistons in an 88-73 victory, but the focus afterward was on the team's decision to speak out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miami also posed for a picture earlier in the day wearing team-logo hoodies. Trayvon Martin was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when he was shot last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As leaders, as role models, we're happy that we're able to shed light on a situation that we feel isn't right,&quot; James said. &quot;That's why we did that today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The game also marked the Heat debut of former Gonzaga University star Ronny Turiaf, who was with the Washington Wizards when he broke his hand in January and had not played since. The Wizards traded Turiaf last week to Denver, which waived him on Sunday. He then signed as a free agent with Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turiaf played 11 minutes and scored four points and grabbed four rebounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Sixers stay in first:&lt;/b&gt; Elton Brand scored 20 points, and Spencer Hawes had 12 points and 10 rebounds to help the 76ers remain in first place in the Atlantic Division with a 99-86 victory over the Boston Celtics in Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was a serious scare when Celtics guard Mickael Pietrus left on a stretcher and was to be hospitalized overnight after an awkward collision late in the first half. He was listed as having a &quot;closed head injury.&quot; No other details were available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Thunder survive Love's 51:&lt;/b&gt; Russell Westbrook scored 45 points, Kevin Durant added 40 points and a season-high 17 rebounds and the Oklahoma City Thunder overcame a career-high 51 points from Minnesota All-Star Kevin Love to beat the visiting Timberwolves 149-140 in double overtime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Lakers beat Trail Blazers:&lt;/b&gt; Andrew Bynum had 28 points and nine rebounds, point guard Ramon Sessions had 20 points and 11 assists in his first start for the Lakers, and host Los Angeles beat the Portland Trail Blazers 103-96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Hornets' Smith punished for foul on Griffin:&lt;/b&gt; Hornets forward Jason Smith was suspended two games for his hard foul Thursday on Los Angeles Clippers' star Blake Griffin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;b&gt;JETS RALLY TO KEEP PLAYOFF HOPES ALIVE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NHL:&lt;/b&gt; Tim Stapleton scored 2:37 into overtime, and the Winnipeg Jets rallied from three goals down and kept themselves in the playoff hunt with a 4-3 victory over the Capitals in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spencer Machacek scored his first NHL goal with 3:45 remaining in regulation to tie it, and the Jets went on to break a two-game losing streak and pull within four points of the final postseason spot in the Eastern Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Oilers slip past Panthers in shootout:&lt;/b&gt; Ryan Nugent-Hopkins scored the deciding goal in the fourth round of a shootout to give the Edmonton Oilers a 2-1 victory over the Florida Panthers in Sunrise, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Leafs top Devils in shootout:&lt;/b&gt; James Reimer made 43 saves and all three Toronto players scored in the shootout to lead the Maple Leafs to a 4-3 victory over the New Jersey Devils in Newark, N.J.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Blackhawks' Keith suspended:&lt;/b&gt; Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Duncan Keith was suspended for five games without pay for elbowing Vancouver star Daniel Sedin in the head during a game Wednesday night. The suspension will cost him $149,688.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;b&gt;HAMLIN WINS POLE AT AUTO CLUB SPEEDWAY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AUTO RACING:&lt;/b&gt; Denny Hamlin has won the pole at Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, Calif., with teammate Kyle Busch joining him in the top two spots for Sunday's Sprint Cup race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hamlin turned a lap of 186.403 mph in his Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota during a qualifying session, running low on the track while most drivers went high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;b&gt;BEARS RB BARBER SAYS HE WILL RETIRE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NFL:&lt;/b&gt; Chicago Bears running back Marion Barber, 28, said he plans to retire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His decision, posted on the team's web site comes one day after Michael Bush signed a four-year, $14 million contract to be part of a backfield that includes Pro Bowl running back Matt Forte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Seahawks agree to deal with Lumpkin:&lt;/b&gt; The Seattle Seahawks announced it had agreed to terms with backup running back Kregg Lumpkin, 5-foot-11 and 228 pounds, who spent the last two seasons with Tampa Bay. No details of the agreement were released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Saturday signs with Packers:&lt;/b&gt; The Green Bay Packers signed veteran center Jeff Saturday to a two-year deal. The Packers also signed former Colts defensive lineman Daniel Muir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Ravens make moves:&lt;/b&gt; The Baltimore Ravens strengthened their defense and special teams by signing a two-year deal with cornerback Corey Graham, a three-year contract with Brendon Ayanbadejo, and a one-year deal with safety Sean Considine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS - About 400 people shaken by the fatal shooting in Florida of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin huddled under umbrellas and a pavilion at Tower Grove Park Friday evening as rain poured down on the raucous vigil service while participants repeatedly yelled for peace and justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One by one, poets, politicians, pastors and activists stepped up to a microphone to speak out about the death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, Trayvon's story is a story with similarities of other lives violently lost,&quot; said Rachel Lee, 27, who organized the event. &quot;The man who admittedly murdered Trayvon - George Zimmerman - is still out there, and he needs to be arrested. That is what this is all about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was unarmed when he was shot and killed on Feb. 26 in his father's gated community in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman, 28, a neighborhood watch volunteer, said he shot Martin in self-defense and has not been charged. But the incident has spurred outrage across the country, particularly among frican-Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was black, and Zimmerman is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In St. Louis on Friday, there was a rally downtown and later at Tower Grove Park, where the crowd wasn't fazed much by the mud and rain. It seemed to build steam with each speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Francis Slay said he has long encouraged residents to be vigilant in their neighborhoods, but that it seems to be the &quot;opposite of what occurred in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vigilant neighbors are not and should not be vigilantes,&quot; he said. &quot;Vigilantes are worse than the problems that they purport to solve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monica Lavington, 45, of Ferguson, stood by a long puddle, holding a 5-month-old grandbaby in her arms and imagining her 25-year-old son in Martin's place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Something like this could have happened to him,&quot; she said. &quot;So I decided to come out no matter what - rain, sleet or snow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ryan Johnson, 17, the same age as Martin, said he wanted to see how people reacted to the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems like people are talking about it, but I wanted to see what people are going to do about it,&quot; said Johnson, a senior at Mel Carnahan High School of the Future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother, Susan Henry of University City, explained that she has tried to teach her son, who is black and wears dreadlocks, to think before he reacts to authorities who may confront him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you are asked a question, answer it and be careful with your words,&quot; said Henry, who has two teenage boys. &quot;That's the safest thing to do. Don't blurt out. Think, then speak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others had similar stories and fears. Some carried signs and banners, such as one that read: &quot;Please, sir, don't kill our children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As outrage from the shooting moved across the country, President Barack Obama said that if he had a son, &quot;he'd look like Trayvon.&quot; But the Rev. Starsky Wilson told the crowd at Tower Grove that that wasn't enough from an African-American president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Act like this is your daughter, like your son, and do justice,&quot; he said to cheers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Executive Charlie A. Dooley said he couldn't think of any black males who haven't been pulled over by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am 64 and I am stopped every now and again,&quot; he said, rallying the crowd. &quot;Now friends, we have come together for a common cause. Justice in America today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But St. Louis rapper Tef Poe blasted public officials from the microphone for trying to capitalize on the momentum behind the Martin killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This ain't no photo op!&quot; he yelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An earlier rally started with a march from City Hall to Soldiers Memorial, where Aldermanic President Lewis Reed told the group that the country needs a &quot;wake-up call.&quot; He also said St. Louis must begin to respond to shootings here with the same intensity as it has responded to Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many wore hoodies and carried Skittles or cans of iced tea, the items Martin was carrying when he was killed, to highlight their view that Martin was a normal teen who wasn't armed with anything that would make him a threat to Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward Williams, 40, of St. Louis, took a day off from his job at a grocery to be part of the event. He said he was surprised by how many people had turned out for the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apathy runs so deep in St. Louis,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't stand up, but this has touched a deep nerve. We need everybody to stand by this family.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SENJEM'S VIEW</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's misguided to blame the DFL for problems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all due respect, state Senate Majority Leader David Senjem's commentary on the current legislative session is disingenuous (&quot;Republicans invite DFL to stay on task, work for Minnesotans,&quot; March 23). He asks Democrats to &quot;resist bringing forward distractions.&quot; That's laughable. It's Republicans who have been distracting with their insistence on constitutional amendments and divisive politics. Senjem advocates for policies that would be disastrous for our state, including cutting revenue to the budget (while enriching the 1 percent with tax breaks), draining state reserves that we're just beginning to replenish and denying people the right to vote to &quot;solve&quot; nonexistent problems at the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are clearly more interested in promoting their ideology than in serving the people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAVID GREENE, MINNEAPOLIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Geoff Michel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politics and ethics go hand in hand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Geoff Michel, R-Edina, said that an ethics complaint against him is &quot;about politics and payback and has nothing to do with ethics&quot; (&quot;DFLers file ethics charge,&quot; March 20). But is there truly a division between ethics and politics? It seems to me that we would all be better off if those individuals who are in politics would recognize that you cannot separate ethics from what they do. Perhaps a lack of ethics is the source of problems at the Legislature and, for that matter, in Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a person who has taught communication for a number of years, I worked to get my students to understand the significance of ethics. Being ethical means you don't keep things under wraps if they might be harmful to your position. It also means that you don't cut down others with false or misleading statements. It means that you conduct yourself with honesty and integrity. If our legislators need help with this, perhaps they should enroll in an ethics course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LARRY SCHNOOR, MANKATO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer is a professor emeritus at Minnesota State University, Mankato.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DFL ethics complaint against Michel by state Sens. Tom Bakk and Sandra Pappas is more about a vendetta than ethics. Why do they want to waste the Senate's time and money? What good for the state will result? Does the public care? Here is what the filing will do: drive the wedge between Republicans and Democrats deeper to ensure even less chance of cooperation to pass legislation to further the state's business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our state needs people in elective bodies to see the big picture and rise above petty politics. For those in the public who decry the inability of the Legislature to be productive, these two senators provided a vivid reason why not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BARRY LAZARUS, MINNEAPOLIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STUDYING ABOARD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writer painted all such programs in poor light</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Vedder has written an inflammatory condemnation of study abroad with little evidence to support his views (&quot;Studying aboard -- education or financial racket,&quot; www.startribune.com/opinion, March 13). That approach is familiar in the political arena, but disheartening to read from a university professor. Study abroad expanded beyond foreign language majors many years ago and is now beneficial for any college student planning to work in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the globalized nature of most professions, we in higher education do our students an important service by teaching them about international perspectives and by immersing them in other cultures and languages. As with many academic programs, it's undoubtedly true that some study-abroad programs are more rigorous than others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of us in higher education work hard to increase academic standards across the curriculum. But to condemn all study-abroad programs in an assortment of unsubstantiated accusations does nothing to clarify problems or work toward what can be improved. If a study-abroad program is not academically rigorous, I would begin by examining the standards set by the professor teaching the program and the university sponsoring it. If programs at Ohio University are not in that category, perhaps Vedder should implement existing standards rather than condemn the entire enterprise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lessons to be learned in Florida teen's death</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's amazing how cavalier we have become with guns. The Florida shooting of unarmed Trayvon Martin went virtually uninvestigated until there was public outcry (&quot;Is 'Stand Your Ground' justified in teen's death?&quot; March 21). A young girl is shot in Washington County, and the deputy states that it did not appear that the shooters did anything wrong (&quot;Stray bullet hits girl: 'I thought it was a rock',&quot; March 21). Really? The first rule of gun safety on the NRA website states: &quot;... be aware of the area beyond your target. This means observing your prospective area of fire before you shoot. Never fire in a direction in which there are people or any other potential for mishap. Think first. Shoot second.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MICHAEL WRIGHT, MANKATO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vigilante who chased, shot and killed the Florida teenager, despite being told by an emergency dispatcher not to do so, hasn't been charged with a crime. That scenario could also have played out in Minnesota had our state's chief executive not listened to the unanimous voice of law enforcement organizations and vetoed a similar law earlier this month. Instead of caving into the NRA mouthpieces in the Legislature, Gov. Mark Dayton wisely rejected the misguided bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JAY HUMSEY, WOODBURY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is, Dayton ignored the bipartisan support for the bill and the wishes of a lot of law-abiding citizens in our state. He also ignored the facts that are not presented everyday by the media -- that law-abiding citizens don't shoot one another in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What law-abiding citizens want are the rights to bear arms and protect ourselves that are given to us in the Second Amendment and are taken away by criminals, the courts and leaders like Dayton. I am certain that the sponsors and supporters of the Minnesota bill did not intend it for the promotion of violence. I expect that they meant to give citizens better protection of the law and to promote firearm education, awareness, training, and good and lawful decisionmaking in the defense of themselves and their families.</SPAN></P>

Thousands rallied in the Florida town of Sanford where Martin was shot dead by volunteer neighbourhood watch guard George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW DELHI: Twelve people have died from swine flu in India since the beginning of March and nearly 110 others have been infected, India's health ministry said. The victims were from the western states of Maharashtra and Rajasthan as well as southern Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. More than 500 died from swine flu in India and more than 14 000 people tested positive in 2009. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONROVIA: Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace Laureate, yesterday defended her country's stand on gay rights. Sirleaf said she would not sign any law whatsoever relating to homosexuality. &quot;We've got certain traditional values in our society that we would like to preserve,&quot; she says. Many traditional African countries consider homosexuality &quot;un-African&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW: Russia's growing drug addiction problem can be controlled quickly and efficiently by imprisoning addicts, its Federal Narcotics Control Service chief said yesterday. The maximum penalty - about R115 - was not enough to deter addicts, director Viktor Ivanov said. &quot;I don't think that it should be a terrifying, cruel penalty. They could be sent to prison for six months or a year,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRUSSELS: The EU banned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's wife Asma from visiting the EU or shopping with European companies. The sanctions are notable for including London-born Asma, whose luxury shopping habit was laid bare in hacked e-mails. Once admired, she has turned into a hate figure for many Syrians, standing by her husband as he conducts a bloody crackdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAIPEI: An MP's suggestion that Taiwan men were &quot;abandoning&quot; local women for foreign brides sparked a protest by advocacy groups yesterday.

Groups representing women and immigrants that took part in the protest at the legislature demanded an apology from Chang.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABERDEEN TOWNSHIP, New Jersey: More than 900 students at a New Jersey middle school have been told not to hug. The district says Matawan-Aberdeen Middle School principal Tyler Blackmore made an announcement that pupils were in a &quot;no hugging school&quot; following some &quot;incidents of unsuitable physical interactions&quot;. Blackmore said students who hug will not be suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRUSSELS: The EU slapped fresh sanctions on Belarus yesterday to persuade President Alexander Lukashenko's authoritarian regime to free all political prisoners. EU foreign ministers agreed to freeze the assets of 29 companies, block accounts and ban EU travel for 12 individuals. Diplomats said the individuals would include nine police and judicial officials and three businessmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON: British MPs are calling for the tower housing Big Ben - the beloved London bell that chimes the quarter hour - to be renamed in honour of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TBO.com </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA A local Facebook group is organizing a rally today in protest over officials' handling of the Trayvon Martin case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Real Talk: Real Answers,&quot; a group of about 100 members, says the peaceful rally at Al Lopez Park is in support of the Justice for Tray movement and is modeled after the recent &quot;Million Hoodie March&quot; in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group says the public is welcome and encourages protesters to wear hoodies, and bring posters and signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants will meet at 10:30 a.m. at the park, 4010 N. Himes Ave., then proceed at 11 a.m. to North Dale Mabry Highway at Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gathering is expected to last until 1 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstration is among several across the country related to Martin, a Miami Gardens 17-year-old who was fatally shot while walking to his father's Sanford home from a convenience store by a neighborhood watch volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting has sparked national outrage because no criminal charges have been filed against the shooter, George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Dennis Baxley believes he did a good thing when he sponsored the legislation that eventually became Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law. He says he is proud of his work and he'd do it again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes that, even though the law was used by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman as justification for shooting 17-year-old Trayvon Martin to death in Sanford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was armed with a bag of Skittles and a cup of iced tea and apparently only was guilty of walking where Zimmerman could see him. Zimmerman was told in a 911 call to leave Martin be, but he didn't. Police bought Zimmerman's story that he felt threatened and decided not to arrest him, sparking widespread protests and a call from Gov. Rick Scott to review the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simply put, the law allows people to be immune from prosecution or civil action if they act in self-defense. People are not required to retreat in the face of danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baxley stands his ground, so to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is about the application of that law,&quot; Baxley said. &quot;The first thing I thought of when news came out about this is that there's nothing in the statute that authorizes pursue and confront. That's a disqualifying factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When a law-abiding citizen is confronted with attack, he should be able to defend himself. But (Zimmerman) was told by police he shouldn't pursue. Once he did that, he was on thin ice as far as this statute is concerned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has been referred to a grand jury, and the Sanford police chief has temporarily stepped aside. State and federal investigators are asking their own questions amid increasing calls for swift action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may not be that easy. Despite the outrage, the law offers Zimmerman several protections. Even though the 911 tape suggests he pursued Martin when the cops told him to stay away, he can claim he thought Martin was armed. There were reports that Zimmerman was bleeding from a head wound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, as Baxley observed, &quot;Why is someone who is supposed to be out there watching and reporting carrying a firearm?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because he can?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that plays out, consider these other ways &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; has been used to justify using lethal force in defense. Earlier this week, a Miami judge dismissed a second-degree murder charge against a man who chased another for more than a block before stabbing him to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And next month, a hearing is scheduled in Tampa over Trevor Dooley's claim that he was defending himself when he shot and killed David James on a basketball court in a Valrico park. According to testimony, Dooley tried to shoo a skateboarder away when James got involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dooley went to his garage and came back with something sticking out of his waistband. Witnesses said there was an argument, James tried to walk away, and Dooley pursued and pulled out a gun. There was a brief scuffle as James tried to get the gun away from Dooley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James was shot through the heart and died at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to look at the big picture,&quot; Baxley said. &quot;We can sit for hours and armchair-quarterback this, but when a victim is under attack he only has seconds to think. They have to know we're going to be with them, that they can protect their lives and their families. It's frustrating to me when I see the anti-gun lobby use this to attack the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People hurt people. There are murders in prison, where there are no guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, it's legitimate to ask Baxley about how people's interpretation of the law may differ from its intent. It's impossible to crawl inside people'sheads to see if they truly felt threatened. If a person is coming through your window in the middle of the night or has his hands around your throat, that's one thing. But what if someone is just paranoid and has an itchy trigger finger? Should the law protect that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to err on the side of supporting people's right to defend themselves,&quot; Baxley said. &quot;I am really quite comfortable with this statute. I think we've actually saved a lot of lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked Baxley if it would be worth looking at the law's language, to cover situations like the Sanford case. He said no, pointing out that about half the states have laws similar to the one in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are we open to legislative solutions? Of course we are,&quot; he said. &quot;But the law is carefully worded and it passed overwhelmingly in the Legislature. I hesitate to open this statute. A lot of work went into this. It was well-vetted and discussed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may be true, but that debate was held in the somewhat civil chambers of public policy in Tallahassee. Like it or not, there are some people who see danger in the eyes of every stranger, or think bullets are the best way to settle an argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They seem to think they have the law on their side. Maybe they do.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY DONNA KOEHN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tampa Tribune</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's one of the most utilitarian pieces of clothing hanging in just about everybody's closet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Green and white hoodies with the Bulls logo can be spotted all over the University of South Florida campus. Androgynous tween heartthrob Justin Bieber wears hoodies, and parents don't bat an eye. Bealls sells them as resort wear for grandmothers; Trendy Tummy Maternity offers one with concealed openings for breastfeeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when a young black man dons one, and pulls up the hood against the rain or cold, people get nervous. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unarmed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, was wearing a dark-colored hoodie on a drizzling night in late February when he was shot to death by a neighborhood watch captain in the Orlando suburb of Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the hoodie has become a symbol of injustice in a flash flood of protests against the shooting and the lack of an arrest of shooter George Zimmerman, who says he acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Tampa area supporters will pull on their hoodies for a rally starting at 10 a.m. at Al Lopez Park and moving to the corner of Dale Mabry Highway and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard at 11 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell people it could have been any of our kids or our nephews,&quot; says Jean Vixamar, who belongs to Real Talk: Real Answers, a local Facebook group behind the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook and Twitter have sparked with anger over the shooting, as supporters replaced profile pictures with photos of themselves or their children wearing hoodies. Twitter, which has higher usage rates among blacks than whites, has been inundated with tweets from users, including filmmaker Spike Lee and popular syndicated radio host and activist Michael Baisden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vixamar says the Real Talk: Real Answers event will mirror others across the country in which protesters have worn hoodies and carried Skittles, the candy Martin bought at a convenience store just before the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, it's going to be in the 80s, and it'll be hot out there with a hoodie on,&quot; Vixamar says. But there's a point to be made. &quot;The hoodie does have a negative connotation. Young black men have to be aware. Anyone else can wear it, and it's fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geraldo Rivera on the Fox News Channel on Friday urged black and Latino parents to forbid their children to leave the house in the hooded jacket. He said he believes the hoodie was as responsible as Zimmerman for Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time you see someone stick up a 7-Eleven, the kid is wearing a hoodie,&quot; said Rivera, on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends.&quot; &quot;Every time you see a mugging on a surveillance camera ... it's the kid with a hoodie. You have to recognize that this whole stylizing yourself as a gangsta -- you're going to be a gangsta wannabe? Well, people are going to perceive you as a menace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hoodie has a decades-long reputation as the bad boy of the closet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Created by Champion in the 1930s for laborers in the cold warehouses of New York, a sad, gray version became famous in the 1970s, when Sylvester Stallone wore it during training montages in the boxing movie &quot;Rocky.&quot; At about the same time, the hip-hop culture adopted it as a symbol of cool anonymity and vague menace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hoodie became forever linked with seedy, threatening criminality when it was depicted in FBI composite drawings of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, who began a mail bomb campaign in the late 1970s and was arrested in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graffiti artists, skateboarders and fans of punk music mimicked the scruffy look that announced the wearer as anything but mainstream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hoodie's importance as a fashion statement was noted recently by the Huffington Post, which reported that a crystal-studded hoodie made by rapper Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs had been acquired by the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet shopping malls in the United Kingdom and Australia have banned hoodies because of their nefarious past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearwater High School recently joined other middle and high schools in forbidding the jackets be worn on campus, despite their popularity with student athletes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teenagers and young adults in Sulphur Springs, a neighborhood off Nebraska Avenue in Tampa, feel incensed about the events in Sanford, but not surprised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody should be able to wear a hoodie,&quot; says LaRyanna Burns, 15, who says she wears one often. But, she says, a black girl can get away with it when a black young man cannot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dozen young people gathered Friday afternoon at Community Stepping Stones, a nonprofit neighborhood organization in Sulphur Springs that teaches teenagers art, to discuss the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked if they believed Zimmerman eventually would be arrested, only one boy, who was white, raised his hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether he (Martin) ran or tried to stand up to him (Zimmerman), he would have been shot either way,&quot; LaRyanna said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All agreed that if it were a black neighborhood watch captain who shot a white teenager, an arrest would have occurred immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 12, Elisha Edmond said he has seen police stop black males in his neighborhood for no reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They just looked for something to arrest him for,&quot; he said, adding that this makes young black men like him uneasy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody should be allowed to shoot somebody because they're wearing a hoodie and look suspicious,&quot; said Andrew VanBuren, 18, who is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laura McElroy, Tampa police spokeswoman, says officers would not profile someone just because he wore a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reality is, people who commit crimes utilize disguises,&quot; she says. &quot;That might be sunglasses or ski masks. Does that mean every-one in sunglasses is a suspect?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hoodies are popular with all elements. I just ordered mine from Eddie Bauer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, watch captain Zimmerman called police when he spotted Martin walking in his neighborhood, and mentioned that he looked suspicious and that he was wearing a dark hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A black hoodie also played a role this week in the trial of Nicholas Lindsey Jr., who is accused of shooting St. Petersburg Police Officer David Crawford in downtown St. Petersburg in February 2011. After Crawford tried to question the then-16-year-old about some car burglaries in the area, police say Lindsey shot the officer and ran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses recognized the black hoodie the shooter wore, and Lindsey's DNA was found on the jacket, which was held up in court as evidence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce Springsteen was taking roll call of his E Street soldiers, the musicians who follow him into rock battle night after night, decade after decade. After he name-checked his 16 loyalists at the Tampa Bay Times Forum on Friday, he asked the crowd to remember the two fallen warriors who weren't there: organ player Danny Federici and sax leviathan Clarence &quot;Big Man&quot; Clemons, their familiar places onstage illuminated by spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only thing I can guarantee tonight,&quot; Springsteen said of his late friends, &quot;is if you're here, and we're here, then they're here.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sold-out crowd of 17,591 amen'd to that, taking boisterous cues from the blue-collar bard himself, a man who sends off his angels not with a whimper but a roar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cue the celebration, the rock and the roll, a near-three-hour throwdown that showed the 62-year-old Jersey boy in full-on howl-at-the-moon mode. I've seen Springsteen a dozen times, but I've never heard him so loud, so loose, so happy to be here. He even introduced himself with self-deprecating fervor -- &quot;He's sexy and he knows it!&quot; &quot;He had the No. 1 album in America for one consecutive week!&quot; - setting the weekend-kickoff vibe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He howled between anthemic cuts from new album Wrecking Ball - including opening one-two wallop of We Take Care of Our Own and the title cut - with why-not rarities (Talk to Me, Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?) and know-'em-by-hearters (The Promised Land, Atlantic City, Thunder Road). He even nodded to a recent gig at Harlem's Apollo Theater with swingin' cuts from the Temptations and Wilson Pickett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Prove It All Night, he pointed to another hulking sax prodigy, a wild-haired young man named Jake Clemons, the Big Man's nephew. Every time the kid wailed on that mighty horn, the audience raised its hands, its collective voice, in welcome and remembrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Springsteen and his E Streeters have only been on the road for a few shows, but the set list is already a wild guessing game, and don't you know his band thrives on switching gears at the last second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mighty Max Weinberg pounded the drums like a man possessed during Radio Nowhere. Guitarist Nils Lofgren injected a searing solo into American Skin (41 Shots), originally written about the police shooting death of Amadou Diallo but taking on new resonance in the wake of the Trayvon Martin killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political speeches were kept to a minimum, although devastating new story-song Jack of All Trades, about a broken man trying to lift the spirits of his wife, was a chiller. Still, the messages were mostly delivered with gusto over gravitas: My City of Ruins, The Rising, the Celtic stomp of Death to My Hometown, for which Springsteen uncorked a militaristic jig.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The volume remained for the encore: Land of Hope and Dreams, Born to Run.Jake Clemons blew that fat sax line as his Boss stomped and howled and grinned. He invited a young girl onstage for Dancing in the Dark. In the middle of Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out, he stopped the song dead in its tracks to honor the Big Man. But it wasn't a moment of silence; it was a moment of mayhem. Some things change; the Boss, bless his immortal heart, stays the same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 24--TAMPA -- Word about the rally for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin didn't come from the church pulpit on a Sunday, but via Facebook and Twitter on a Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no Bull Connor or biting police dogs or fire hoses spraying the peaceful crowd of hundreds as it marched down a sidewalk along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in northwest Tampa on Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things have changed since the 1960s, said Orlando Davis, a morning radio personality with 94.1 FM, as he stood on a podium at the rallying point and addressed the crowd. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unarmed young black man was gunned down. Mostly black marchers, shouting the decades-old chant, &quot;No justice, no peace,&quot; demanded answers to why the white shooter, a neighborhood watch captain named George Zimmerman, had not been charged with a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis, speaking into a microphone, said that while watching CNN he heard Zimmerman's attorney say, &quot;Zimmerman was not claiming a stand your ground defense. ... He said he was attacked by Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Davis spoke, some of those who gathered shouted, &quot;Lies, lies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And though the Feb. 26 killing in Sanford has taken on racial overtones, Davis tried to play that down. He pointed out everyone &quot;has hoodies in your closet&quot; similar to the one Martin was wearing the night he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a black issue,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not a white issue. It is a young issue. A right issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally was organized through a Facebook page for a group called &quot;Real Talk: Real Answers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It [the Facebook page] was started about a year ago by a group of friends as a way to vent about issues,&quot; said Nina Range, 31, from Tampa, who organized the rally and began spreading the word through social media Wednesday night, then with press releases to traditional media the following day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wearing a black hoodie and dark sunglasses, Range said the Facebook forum gives members a way to talk about politics, religion and current events. Watching coverage of Martin's shooting, she said she decided to do something to bring awareness of the issue to the Tampa Bay area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police estimate between 600 and 800 people marched. For many of them, Martin's killing was felt on a personal, visceral level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was a bad shooting,&quot; said Steeve A. Jocelyn, 28, of Tampa, as he marched through Al Lopez Park carrying the hoodie-clad 3-year-old son of a friend on his shoulders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jocelyn said his conclusion, based on media reports that Zimmerman shot Martin after chasing him, was the result of experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a cop,&quot; he said, explaining he is an Air Force Reserve senior airman and member of the 927 Aerial Refueling Wing security force squadron. &quot;The 'Stand Your Ground' law is about defending yourself. But you have to be standing, not chasing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though it became increasingly hot as the march made its way from the park to the rallying point, Shirley Copeland, 59, said she wouldn't take off the black hoodie she was wearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't care if it's hot,&quot; said Copeland, holding a sign reading, &quot;I Am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am wearing this hoodie,&quot; Copeland said. &quot;My children wear hoodies. Wearing a hoodie doesn't mean you are a criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Martin was shot, he was wearing a hoodie, carrying an iced tea and a bag of Skittles candy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those factors resonated with a pre-teen who had the same last name but was not related. Holding up a sign with checkmarks for &quot;iced tea,&quot; &quot;Skittles,&quot; &quot;hoodie,&quot; &quot;black&quot; and the words &quot;Am I Next?&quot; Zion Martin, 11, said he could identify with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And for more than sharing a last name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am young and black,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin also has intimate knowledge of what the slain teen's family might be feeling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I was three years old, my dad was shot and killed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother, LaTonya Martin, said her son's father was killed Aug. 23, 2004, in New York while attending a friend's funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one has been arrested for killing my dad,&quot; Zion Martin said. &quot;I am waiting for justice, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No issue is as sensitive, explosive or fundamental to American politics and national self-perception as race. The United States has made titanic strides in the past two generations to overcome centuries of racial division and the bitter legacy of civil war. But every so often an incident occurs which not only highlights lingering prejudice and injustice but stirs atavistic emotions that are all too readily exploited by those seeking political advantage. The fatal shooting of a black teenager by a white vigilante in a gated community in Florida is one such incident, and has provoked the loudest racial uproar for 21 years, one whose echoes are now reverberating around the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To any reasonable person, the shooting looks like an inexcusably racist provocation. Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old black youth, was walking home when George Zimmerman, a white 28-yearold community guard, thought he was acting suspiciously. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although told by local police not to follow the hooded youth, he did so and, in circumstances yet to be explained, shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman was neither arrested nor accused of any crime. Under Florida's controversial &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; law, the lethal use of force is permitted in cases of self defence. In the five years since the law was passed, however, the number of &quot;justifiable homicides&quot; has tripled to more than 100 in 2010 from just over 30. And despite the vigorous support for the law by the National Rifle Association, critics, who include Florida's prosecutors, have said it encourages vigilante justice. The matter might have remained there, had it not been for the outrage that swept across the black community in Sandford and then spread rapidly, via social media, to the rest of the state and beyond. Many African-Americans see the incident as a blatant example of racial profiling and double standards: had the youth been white, they argue, his assailant would swiftly have been prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's authorities have reacted with commendable speed and balance. The prosecutor and police chief have stood down and the Governor has called for a thorough review of the law. Like the Rodney King beating in California in 1991, the incident has stirred passions across America and the Justice Department and the FBI have opened a civil rights investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is the reactions of President Obama that will matter more than anything else - first, because he is, as the nation's head of state and government, the man who must set the tone on issues of moral and political importance; and second because he is the first man of African descent to occupy the White House. As such, however, race is an issue of extreme sensitivity for him. A sharp condemnation of the events could trigger a political backlash in Florida, prejudice any inquiry and even trigger a distracting row over states' rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Mr Obama has reacted adroitly, expressing sympathy for the victim's family and calling on all America to engage in &quot;soul-searching&quot;. He himself made his finest campaign speech on race, in reaction to the row over his outspoken black pastor's remarks. And after his less happy intervention over a black professor mistakenly arrested as a burglar in 2009, he urged America, and himself, to draw the &quot;teachable moment&quot; from the incident. That was the right phrase. It is one that America must still draw, day in, day out, in its cities and in its politics. Florida has shown the lethal consequences of not doing so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama may be the first black president but he doesn't like to talk about it much. This reluctance to address America's deep racial divisions, from a man who knows that he is a lasting symbol of civil rights progress, is viewed by some as an act of political cowardice, a narrow calculation designed to secure re-election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of civil rights leaders and black writers have spent the past month calling on the White House to condemn the Florida police department investigating the death of Trayvon Martin, below. When Mr Obama finally broke his silence on the issue yesterday it was typically non-confrontational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight months before his bid for re-election he used the emotive words of a parent, rather than a president, to deliver a delicately balanced political pitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama must convince America's sceptical working-class white voters to give him another chance. Divisive arguments over race are unlikely to help his cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It began as a small-town shooting that inflamed first a family, then a community, then a country and now the world. In President Obama's first public acknowledgment of the uproar over the death of a black teenager in Florida, he said yesterday: &quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a powerful endorsement of the growing unease over the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the President backed state and federal inquiries and offered solemn reflection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon,&quot; he said. &quot;We are going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened ... every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly four weeks have passed since Trayvon, 17, set off on an errand from his father's home in a middle-class gated community in Sanford and got shot dead on his way back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gunman was George Zimmerman, 28, the Neighbourhood Watch captain who once took a college course in criminal justice, had a habit of prowling about with a gun in his waistband, and rang police minutes before the shooting to report &quot;a real suspicious guy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had said: &quot;This guy looks like he's up to no good or he's on drugs or something ... he's got something in his hands.&quot; He said he was pursuing the teenager. Trayvon, meanwhile, was on his mobile phone, telling his girlfriend of a strange man following him. Witnesses reported the two fighting and that Trayvon was shot dead. The &quot;something&quot; in his hands was a bag of Skittles sweets and a can of iced tea that he had been to buy for his little brother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was black. Mr Zimmerman is a light-skinned half-Hispanic, considered by many as white. He told Sanford police that Trayvon, who was unarmed, attacked him and that he exercised his right under Florida's Stand Your Ground law to shoot in selfdefence - an argument they accepted and let him go. However, in the background of 911 emergency calls made by other neighbours that night, it is Trayvon who is heard bellowing: &quot;Help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford is normally an uneventful community in terms of world news. It is 30 miles from the tourist sprawl of Orlando and Disney World and has a picturesque lakefront, historic centre, antiques shops and a thriving arts scene. Now it is a Deep South town on the march, stirred by the same racial outrage that Dr Martin Luther King fought to correct more than half a century ago. Ten thousand people rallied in Fort Mellon Park on Thursday night, demanding Mr Zimmerman's arrest and an end to what has long been perceived by some as racism by local police. Many people brought children clutching Skittles and cans of iced tea. &quot;Am I next?&quot; read a placard held by one black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of people pressed in on Martin Luther King III, son of the founder of the civil rights movement, as he tried to ease his way through the crowd after making a speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm encouraged that people would rally around injustice,&quot; he told The Times. &quot;I don't think my father would have been discouraged by what happened, he would have been encouraged by the reaction. We are the kind of nation that he wanted to see, with faith and justice and equality for all, but sadly we are not there yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents quoted from the Bible and thanked the public for their support. &quot;I stand before you not knowing how I am walking today, because my heart is hurting for my son,&quot; Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon's mother, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev Al Sharpton, patriarch of the civil rights movement, veered between rhetoric and humour as he led the rally, at one point telling the dignitaries around him to give Ms Fulton more space. He appealed for people to write cheques to help support the family. &quot;That's T-H-O-U-S-A-N-D,&quot; he spelt to the crowd. This, he said, was about every child in America, not just Trayvon, a sentiment echoed by many of those present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Bronzo, 53, who is white, had a sign that read: &quot;Hey Sanford police. Shame, shame.&quot; He said: &quot;This town is full of the old boys' network, white cops, old southern boys. It's sad and it's an embarrassment in front of the whole world. These people have been oppressed by a corrupt police force for years. Everybody should be out here, every colour, every man, woman and child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Lee, the Sanford police chief, has stepped aside &quot;temporarily&quot; to let passions cool. Mr Sharpton said that Mr Zimmerman should be &quot;in jail with his hands cuffed&quot; and added: &quot;Hey, there's a little fellow down the road he'd have shot too. Mickey Mouse - black, big ears, looks suspicious. Just lucky he doesn't have a hoodie on.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests are dubbed &quot;Million Hoodie Marches&quot; in memory of the victim, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was reportedly wearing a hoodie sweatshirt when he was shot last month in a gated community by a white volunteer security guard.<BR>Fritz Andre, 24, a data analyst, said he joined the rally because &quot;it s one of those one in a lifetime, generational moments.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Urging Americans to &quot;do some soul searching,&quot; President Barack Obama injected himself into the emotional debate over the fatal shooting of a teenager in Florida, turning the racially charged case into a personal matter for the nation's first black president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's words also catapulted the death in Florida of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin into the presidential campaign. Three Republicans seeking Obama's job all used the word &quot;tragedy&quot; to describe the shooting, as the president did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can only imagine what these parents are going through, and when I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANTORUM'S RURAL EDGE KEEPS HIM IN GOP CONTEST: Republican presidential nominating contests often reveal a rural-urban split in the party, but what sets this year's campaign apart is the emphasis Rick Santorum is placing on that divide and wearing his successes in small-town America as a badge of honor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To hear Santorum tell it, the ability of front-runner Mitt Romney to win in big-city suburbs is a mark of ideological weakness, not political strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gov. Romney does well in the counties where Democrats do well, and we do well in the counties where Republicans do well,&quot; Santorum said in West Monroe, La. &quot;That might give you some indication as to who the candidate is who best reflects the values of the Republican party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROMNEY SAYS OBAMA'S HEALTH LAW AN 'UNFOLDING DISASTER': Mitt Romney on Friday looked to pre-empt Supreme Court arguments that will shine a spotlight on a key vulnerability for him in the Republican primary - health care reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney called Democratic President Barack Obama's signature overhaul &quot;an unfolding disaster for the American economy, a budget-busting entitlement and a dramatic new federal intrusion into our lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney was marking the second anniversary of the signing of the health care law, which requires all Americans to pay insurance or face a tax penalty. That mandate to buy insurance has become a focal point for conservative anger, and critics say it represents unwanted or even unconstitutional government intrusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOCUMENTS SHOW NYPD INFILTRATED LIBERAL GROUPS: Undercover NYPD officers attended meetings of liberal political organizations and kept intelligence files on activists who planned protests around the country, according to interviews and documents that show how police have used counterterrorism tactics to monitor even lawful activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The infiltration echoes the tactics the NYPD used in the run-up to New York's 2004 Republican National Convention, when police monitored church groups, anti-war organizations and environmental advocates nationwide. That effort was revealed by The New York Times in 2007 and in an ongoing federal civil rights lawsuit over how the NYPD treated convention protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said the pre-convention spying was necessary to prepare for the huge, raucous crowds that were headed to the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FACEBOOK TAKES STEPS TO ADDRESS PRIVACY CONCERNS: Facebook has taken steps in recent days to address more worries about privacy, warning employers not to ask prospective employees for their passwords and trying to clarify its user &quot;rights and responsibilities&quot; policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the latter effort backfired when tens of thousands of users, mostly in Germany, misunderstood the clarifications and blasted the company, even though nothing substantive had changed. Their discontent showed that, no matter what Facebook does, privacy concerns are still the biggest threat to users' trust and to its growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is such an incredible level of scrutiny now about anything any company does about privacy,&quot; said Jules Polonetsky, director of the Future of Privacy Forum, an industry-backed think tank in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORLD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TENS OF THOUSANDS IN SYRIA CALL FOR FALL OF REGIME: Tens of thousands of Syrians braved tear gas and gunfire to protest across the country Friday, vowing to storm the capital Damascus to oust President Bashar Assad as the European Union ramped up pressure on the regime by imposing sanctions on his wife and other close relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security forces deployed in many cities to disperse protests, but opposition groups reported fewer protester deaths than in past weeks. Activists said more than 20 people were killed nationwide in army attacks on opposition areas or clashes with armed rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International condemnation and high-level diplomacy have failed to stop the year-old Syria crisis, which the U.N. says has killed more than 8,000 people, many of them civilian protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EUROPE FACES NEW HOMEGROWN JIHADIST THREAT: With France's deadly attacks, Islamic terror has apparently struck once more in the heart of Europe - and authorities say there is a dangerous twist: the emergence of homegrown extremists operating independent of any known networks, making them difficult to track and stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a different kind of jihadist threat emerging and it's getting stronger,&quot; Europol chief Rob Wainwright told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from The Hague. &quot;It is much more decentralized and harder to track.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France's motorcycle gunman traumatized a nation heading into presidential elections and spread fear across the continent that the specter of al-Qaida was once again threatening daily life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POPE ARRIVES IN MEXICO DENOUNCING VIOLENCE: Pope Benedict XVI set off on a pilgrimage to the New World on Friday, calling on Mexicans to conquer an &quot;idolatry of money&quot; that feeds drug violence and urging Cuba to leave behind a Marxism that &quot;no longer responds to reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benedict spoke to reporters aboard a special Alitalia flight carrying him to central Mexico, where a swelling crowd gathered along the route he would take from the airport later in the day. The pope said a lust for money was behind the drug violence that has claimed more than 47,000 lives in the country since 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Benedict will head for Cuba, and said it is &quot;evident that Marxist ideology as it was conceived no longer responds to reality,&quot; and he urged Cubans to &quot;find new models, with patience, and in a constructive way.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past few weeks, hundreds of thousands of social media messages have spread the word about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black teen was shot to death Feb. 26 by neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Racial tensions have rapidly escalated as civil rights groups have held rallies, calling the shooting unjustified. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman claims self-defence, saying he shot after Martin attacked him. Zimmerman's father is white, and his mother is Peruvian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. President Barack Obama chose a personal way to weigh in on the case Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said in Washington, adding that &quot;every aspect&quot; of the case should be investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was wearing the hood of his sweatshirt up, and Zimmerman told a police dispatcher he thought the 17-year-old looked suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Facebook, some protesters are wearing hoodies in their profile photos with the caption, &quot;Do I look suspicious?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami Heat basketball players joined the conversation Friday with similar visual statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dwyane Wade posted to his Facebook page a picture of himself wearing a hoodie. Later, LeBron James posted a picture on his Twitter account of the Heat team in hoodies, with the caption, &quot;#WeAreTrayvonMartin #Hoodies #Stereotyped #WeWantJustice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera had a different take on the hoodie debate, saying Friday that people who wear them are often going to be perceived as a menace and urging parents on Twitter to tell their kids not to wear them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll bet you money that if (Martin) didn't have that hoodie on, that nutty neighbourhood watch guy wouldn't have responded in that violent and aggressive way,&quot; Rivera said on Fox &amp; Friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments drew an immediate backlash online.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fear. You could smell fear all over the story of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Fear in the call that George Zimmerman, self-appointed neighborhood watchman, placed to the 911 dispatcher about a suspicious figure &quot;looking about&quot; in his gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fear in the phone conversation Trayvon had at the same time with his girlfriend, saying that a man was following him and that he'd put his hoodie on. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fear in the agonized pleas recorded in a neighbor's 911 call as Trayvon and Zimmerman apparently struggled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fear of the nameless, faceless menace of You Shouldn't Be Here. It's the fear that makes someone appoint himself neighborhood watchman in the first place, to make sure nothing Out Of Place shows up. Fear that what you don't know will hurt you. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fear, followed by rage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin looked younger than his 17 years. He was carrying iced tea and Skittles. George Zimmerman must have been terrifying - larger, older, armed. Instead, Zimmerman was, by his own account, terrified. He pursued, shot and killed Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately for the fearful, Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law has their interests at heart. To  kill someone, you need not prove that he or she intended you harm. All you need to prove is a real and reasonable fear that your life is in danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how many fears are reasonable? These days we're more frightened of public speaking than drowning, of spiders than driving. Florida law says that force is justified if someone &quot;reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.&quot; In a word - fear. If my fear is big enough, it can outweigh your life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This law terrifies me. I don't suppose I can shoot it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Zimmerman, the figure in the hoodie was a nameless, faceless menace. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he wasn't. His name was Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, &quot;Slimm&quot; or &quot;Tray&quot; to his friends. He wanted to be an engineer, the stories report. He was taking flying lessons. He got A's and B's and was majoring, said his teacher, in cheerfulness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Wolfe notes in &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; that every kid who dies unjustly and too early retroactively transforms into an honor student with presidential aspirations. This is not quite fair to a kid's memory, but it is the debt we owe the dead. Dead children, in particular, carry with them the burden of our outsize hopes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And hope can cast shadows as massive and false as those cast by fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We live in a terrified age. You can't ride a bicycle without a helmet. You can't knock on your neighbor's door. You can't talk to strangers online because People You Don't Know are Bad and Dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nice people don't harbor racism these days. They have localized fear, fear of life outside the gates. You go here. We'll go there. That is your street. This is my street. This is my school. That is your school. Stay where you don't look Out Of Place to George Zimmerman, and you'll be safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the world is worse than it used to be. Certainly the faceless menace of the Rapist, the Home Invader, the Terrorist, the Child Molester looms more threateningly than ever. But even in the first of these categories, the statistics belie the image. Most people know their attackers. But the Faceless Menace is easier to fear. The unknown is so much more frightening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was afraid of him,&quot; you say. &quot;I was entitled to shoot. You never know what might have happened if I hadn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If George Zimmerman hadn't, there would be one more face in the halls at Dr. Michael M. Krop High School in Miami-Dade, Fla. And after that, who knows?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin wasn't a saint or an allegory. Neither was he a faceless menace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was an aggressively normal kid, a threateningly typical teen. He looms over us, shadow fueled by rage and sadness. And George Zimmerman is getting real threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is where fear takes us, and it's a horrible place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department is investigating, after weeks of local law enforcement's apparent bungling and failure to press charges. But the standards for prosecuting someone for hate crimes are some of the highest set by law. (Trayvon was African American; George Zimmerman is Hispanic.) The standards for shooting someone? In Florida, fear is enough.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a warm day more for short sleeves than sweatshirts, the hoodie- and suit-clad group might have been a bit uncomfortable. The heat, they said, was a small inconvenience when they think of what happened to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the 17-year-old Florida teenager slain Feb. 26 by a neighborhood watch volunteer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 150 people gathered Friday for &quot;Hoodies on the Hill,&quot; a rally and prayer service outside the U.S. Capitol in honor of Martin. Associations of black, Hispanic and Asian Pacific Hill staffers, along with Greek fraternities, sponsored the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ja'Ron Smith, president of the Black Republican Congressional Staff Association, said that many on the Hill represent communities with similar issues, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This gives us the opportunity to educate about race relations,&quot; Smith said. &quot;I think racial profiling is a real issue in our country, and it comes from ignorance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith said he, too, has been racially profiled and wanted to support and pray for Martin and his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unfortunate that somebody could die so young and not be able to experience some of the things that high school students experience, like prom and graduation,&quot; Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olubunmi Ijose, an intern for Rep. Sanford D. Bishop Jr. (D-Ga.), called for shooter George Zimmerman's arrest and said people should have taken notice of the case long ago. The NAACP and African American leaders have a responsibility to stand for justice, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a community, we have to bring attention or awareness to this situation so something can be done to make it a movement,&quot; Ijose said. &quot;We can't let things like this go unnoticed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aaron Jenkins of Operation Understanding DC said that Martin's shooting can transcend the issue of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin incident isn't a black thing or a white thing or necessarily a Latino thing. It's a human thing,&quot; he said. &quot;A life was taken based upon the bias and discrimination that one person had towards another without knowing them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenkins expressed the need to examine &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws and to use the tragedy as an opportunity for conversation about the daily lives of teenagers. The case shows that the country has progressed in matters of racial prejudice, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm really glad to see the support the Martin family has received,&quot; Jenkins said. &quot;Any father, any mother- their fear would be to find out that their child has been killed. I think in that sense, the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case is universal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's difficult history with race relations has been central to the narrative of Barack Obama's rise to the presidency and has often complicated the ways in which he deals with the issue both as a candidate and as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the president's decision Friday to assertively insert himself into the controversy surrounding the fatal shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a black Florida 17-year-old, is evidence of Obama's evolution and rising comfort level in dealing with the matter of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new approach is at once deeply personal and completely universal, and avidly avoids taking sides in a political fight. His appeal Friday was to the parents. &quot;I can only imagine what these parents are going through,&quot; he said. &quot;And I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pulls together - federal, state and local - to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embedded in his remarks in the Rose Garden was a particular message about being a black parent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said. &quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was rare for Obama to directly broach a subject that has caused him more political problems than benefit, but this was not another Obama race speech or his off-the-cuff comments about the arrest of a black Harvard professor in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House officials almost certainly knew Obama would be asked about the Martin shooting soon. The case has stirred immense passion nationwidebecause of its racial element: Martin, who was unarmed, was killed by George Zimmerman, 28, a Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer, who told police that he shot the black teenager in self-defense. Zimmerman has not been charged in Martin's death. Obama did not deal with the details of the incident, managing to discuss the racially charged incident with deep emotion without saying the words &quot;black&quot; or &quot;race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His remarks followed the announcement of his pick to lead the World Bank, not a time when he usually takes questions, but clearly he was ready for one. It was not apparent earlier that Obama would get involved in the controversy. It is the kind of issue that Obama and his aides have bungled in the past. But on Friday, even Republicans running for president followed him into the issue, echoing his call for a full investigation into the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House aides had said repeatedly that they had no comment, calling it a local issue that needed to work its way through the courts. When the Justice Department opened a federal investigation into the case Monday night, senior White House officials kept quiet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all the while, according to White House press secretary Jay Carney, Obama was reading news stories about the case. Top Justice Department officials had informed White House aides in recent days that it wasn't improper for the president to speak out about the ongoing investigation into Martin's shooting, according to a government official with knowledge of those conversations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, an Obama ally who led a rally attended by thousands Thursday night at a park in Sanford, Fla., the city where Martin was killed, said he thought it was important for the president to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It really brings home to people that this kid is not some potential thug in a hoodie,&quot; said Sharpton, who said he had been in touch with the Justice Department but not Obama in recent days. &quot;It brings home the potential of who the son could have been rather than how he was treated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, described his clients as humbled by Obama's comments and struck by physical similarities between their son and the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can we thank him?&quot; Crump said they wanted to know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's comments and his approach to the Florida shooting varied greatly from his handling of a similarly racially charged issue early on in his administration: the arrest by a white police officer of his friend and Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr., who is black. Asked at a news conference in 2009 about the incident - which, at the time, had been dominating the headlines - Obama said police had &quot;acted stupidly&quot; in arresting Gates. His remarks created a political furor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement groups were angry that Obama commented even as he admitted that he did not know the details of the case. Civil rights groups sought to use the president's comments to create a national conversation on racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within days, Obama had to retract his statement and later invited both the police officer and Gates to the White House for a beer. Both liberal activists and political strategists generally panned the meeting, which was awkwardly called &quot;the beer summit,&quot; saying it achieved nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling Obama's response to the Gates arrest &quot;a disaster for the president&quot; because he passed judgment on what had happened, Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary for President George W. Bush, said Obama's message Friday was a welcome contrast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There really is an issue of whether if you are black in America today, if you are dressed the way you are dressed, that that can make you a victim,&quot; Fleischer said. &quot;These are society's most delicate issues, and I thought the president handled it delicately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Navigating race has been a complicated and layered task for Obama and his aides. He has spoken of race primarily in terms of the nation's history and progress rather than current events. At the same time, he has not shied away from embracing his unique role in reflecting the history of blacks in the nation. When he sings in public, he chooses Al Green's &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot; and does it on stage at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, and he has been praised by black radio hosts for his willingness to call into their shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama hit the right notes Friday, said NAACP President Benjamin Jealous, who was one of the activists calling on Obama to speak out about the Martin case, saying, &quot;Obama's words spoke both to the universal pain felt about this case, the specific pain felt by the family and the need for our nation to look at itself in the mirror.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida state Sen. Arthenia Joyner, chair of the state's legislative black caucus, said the president sent a clear message. &quot;I'm old enough to remember the Ku Klux Klan marching through the street,&quot; Joyner said. &quot;My perception of this man, who is our president, is that he gets it at every level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's calibrated answer first deftly avoided commenting on law enforcement or judging the actions of the shooter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made clear that he did not want to step on the legal process started by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. but was not at all reticent to talk about the victim and his family, saying that his main message was to Martin's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD: The Florida police chief who had been bitterly criticised for not arresting a Neighbourhood Watch volunteer in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager temporarily stepped down yesterday, saying he had become a distraction to the investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee and his officers decided not to arrest George Zimmerman after he shot dead 17-year-old Trayvon Martin on February 26. Martin was returning from a trip to a convenience store when Mr Zimmerman started following him, telling police dispatchers he looked suspicious. At some point, the two got into a fight and Mr Zimmerman pulled out his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman claims the shooting was self-defence. He told police Martin attacked him after he had stopped chasing the teenager and was returning to his four-wheel-drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting has ignited racial tensions. Civil rights groups held rallies in Florida and New York, saying the shooting was unjustified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lee said authorities were prohibited from making an arrest based on the facts and circumstances they had at the time of the shooting. He said he continued to stand behind his agency's investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``As a former homicide investigator, a career law enforcement officer and a father, I am keenly aware of the emotions associated with this tragic death of a child. I'm also aware that my role as a leader of this agency has become a distraction from the investigation,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents said Mr Zimmerman should be taken into custody. They said Mr Zimmerman was profiling their son and acted like a vigilante.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We want an arrest, we want a conviction and we want him sentenced for the murder of my son,'' Martin's father, Tracy, said to a crowd of about 1000 supporters in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters reacted to news of Mr Lee's decision to step aside by chanting: ``The chief is gone. Zimmerman is next.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some sold T-shirts that read: ``Arrest Zimmerman.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Attorney's Office is reviewing the case, which will be presented to a grand jury next month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only way I feel there's any hope of getting justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is a campaign of public support&quot; Occupy Chicago protestor Anton Ford said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This protest, one of dozens across the country and one of a number in Chicago itself is calling attention to the Florida case which has garnered national attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airickca Gordon-Taylor, a cousin of Emmitt Till said &quot;As a family, we want justice for them.. We're there for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members of the late Chicagoan Emmitt Till, who's death in 1955 was one of the defining moments of the civil rights movement, spoke in support of Trayvon's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do understand your pain and if Emmitt's mother were alive today she would definitely be there, as his mom's side going through this every step of the way with her,&quot; Gordon-Taylor said Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all have a Trayvon&nbsp;martin in our town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reverend Jesse Jackson at Rainbow Push headquarters also talked about the case, ahead of his trip to be with Trayvon's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So it is today that the people killing and walking free has to end Mr. Zimmerman has to be in jail for a long time,&quot; Rev. Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cook County Commissioner and former State Representative John Fritchey, who attended the rally, said the shooting in Florida of an unarmed teenager will have an impact on the debate over gun control in Illinois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to have to deal with this issue as being one of the only states in the country that doesn't have concealed carry,&quot; Fritchey said, &quot;This story, as stories like them, as people like that are trying to still pass it downstate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a debate that continues, as Chicago and the country look to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death and wonder its impact on their lives in the future.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Justice Department's investigation of an unarmed black teenager's shooting death in Florida may reflect a trend of more aggressive hate crime prosecutions during the Obama administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department has said it opened a civil rights probe into the Feb. 26 slaying of Trayvon Martin, 17. A neighbourhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, told police he shot Martin in self-defence. Authorities are looking into whether Zimmerman used a racial slur before pulling the trigger, the Washington Post reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were 66 federal hate crime prosecutions in the first three years of President Barack Obama's administration compared with 49 during the last three years of the Bush administration. The cases include physical assaults, cross burnings and attacks on houses of worship that were motivated by reasons such as race and ethnicity, prosecutors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This administration has proven it's very willing to pursue the most challenging cases even where they would not be criticized for walking away,&quot; said David Douglass, a former Justice Department lawyer in the unit that handles hate crime cases in the early 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department won't comment on whether it's pursuing the shooting in Sanford, Fla., as a hate crime, said Thomas Perez, the assistant attorney general who oversees the department's civil rights division, in a conference call with reporters Thursday. &quot;We're in the factgathering stage,&quot; Perez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglass and other former Justice Department lawyers said that's the department's likely focus. Yesterday, 14 Democrats on the U.S. House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder asking that he &quot;explore the applicability&quot; of the hatecrime statute and other federal laws. No charges have been filed against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finding evidence that proves race was a motivating factor may be difficult in the Florida case, said Douglass, a lawyer at Shook, Hardy &amp; Bacon LLP in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the White House Friday, Obama said it's &quot;imperative&quot; that &quot;every aspect&quot; of the case be investigated to determine what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rise in hate crime prosecutions is part of an &quot;across the board&quot; increase in civil rights enforcement by the Obama administration, said Xochitl Hinojosa, a Justice Department spokeswoman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 24--The fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old teenager, in Sanford, Fla., has reignited a fiery debate on laws across the country that allow people to use deadly force if they believe they could be killed or seriously hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was fatally shot Feb. 26 while walking back to his father's house after going to the convenience store to buy a bag of Skittles and a can of iced tea. George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, called police to report a stranger in the gated neighborhood and said Martin looked suspicious. He followed Martin in his car, even though the police dispatcher said not to, and got out of his car. An altercation happened, and then Zimmerman shot Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one witnessed the shooting, but someone is heard screaming for help in the 911 calls. Many believe that is Martin, but Zimmerman has said he was the one screaming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has not been charged because he claims self-defense. The case has been racially charged since Martin was black. Zimmerman's mother is Hispanic and his father is white. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the center of the debate is Florida's Stand Your Ground law, which has come under fire by critics who argue that the law, adopted in 2005, makes it too easy for people to pull the trigger instead of call police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law says that people who have a reasonable belief that their life is in imminent danger can use deadly force, no matter where they are, and they have no duty to see if they can escape the situation safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latasha Fuller, a sophomore at Winston-Salem State University, said she is bothered by the Stand Your Ground law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now you have a situation where the police should have arrested someone but did not because of what the person said to them,&quot; she said. &quot;When it should be the case, if you shoot someone, you should be automatically brought in, you should be arrested because you're a suspect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Carolina doesn't have a Stand Your Ground law, but the Republican-led General Assembly did pass laws that now allow people to use deadly force if someone threatens their lives not only at home but in their car and at their workplace. And they have no duty to retreat, meaning they don't have to see if there's a safe escape route, before using deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Bev Perdue said Friday that she wants to wait until all the facts come in about the Martin case before seeing whether any changes need to be made in North Carolina's law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ron Wright, a professor of law at Wake Forest University, said states have three different kinds of laws when it comes to using deadly force and a duty to retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The least common are states that require people to look around and see whether they can get out of a dangerous situation safety before using deadly force, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Carolina is among states that have laws based upon the Castle Doctrine, which refers to the idea that people's homes are their castles and they have the right to defend themselves if someone breaks into their homes, Wright said. Last year, North Carolina legislators approved a change that the National Rifle Association has championed that eliminates the duty to retreat under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they come in the front door with guns blazing, you can stay in your home and fight,&quot; Wright said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legislators also expanded the Castle Doctrine to apply to people's cars and workplaces, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If somebody jumps into your car, you can use deadly force to protect yourself, even if you can jump out the back,&quot; Wright said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, people have the right to use deadly force anywhere as long as they have a reasonable belief that their life is in imminent danger, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The standard in these cases is whether a reasonable person would be in fear of his or her life if put in the same circumstance, according to Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not just on the mind of this shooter,&quot; he said. &quot;It has to be a reasonable belief that you faced the threat of death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail Neely, the assistant director of North Carolinians Against Gun Violence, said the law in North Carolina is not as strong as the Stand Your Ground law in Florida but it is just as &quot;dangerously vague.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You just have to have a reasonable perception that you feel fear,&quot; she said. &quot;There's no duty to retreat. There's no second to think about if there's an alternative to pulling the trigger. It's very hard to define a reasonable feeling of fear, as we're finding out with this young man in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Stephen LaRoque, R-Lenoir, was one of the sponsors of the new North Carolina law. He said he believes what happened in Florida was an isolated incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's tragic that something like that happened,&quot; he said. &quot;It doesn't give me any pause for North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the law is based on a basic American principle that people shouldn't have to retreat from their own property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are some bad people out there and if someone is feeling threatened they have every right to protect themselves,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Valone, president of Grass Roots North Carolina, said that protections are built into the North Carolina and Florida laws. Zimmerman, he said, has no good case to say he acted in self-defense, considering that he pursued Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what's happened is that opponents of these self-defense laws think they have found a poster child to overturn laws that are working quite well in more than two dozen states,&quot; Valone said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The North Carolina and Florida laws require that people have to have a reasonable fear either of imminent death or great bodily harm before they can use deadly force, Valone said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, Valone said, people have no duty to retreat if they are in a place where they are lawfully allowed to be. In other words, you can't break into a house, shoot someone and then claim self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And only if the use of deadly force is deemed justified can someone be protected from criminal prosecution or a civil lawsuit, Valone said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no way that Zimmerman would have been able to escape prosecution under North Carolina law, he said. And he shouldn't get away with killing Martin under Florida's law, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The moment Zimmerman chased down Martin, he lost the use of the Castle Doctrine defense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, the 28-year-old man who was captain of his gated community's neighborhood watch association, told Sanford Police investigators that he shot Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police declined to charge Zimmerman, sparking outrage across the country. State and federal authorities are investigating, and Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee has stepped down temporarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Fuller thinks what happened to Martin could happen to other young black men, such as her brother or cousin, if someone sees them as suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fuller and more than 30 other Winston-Salem State students gathered Friday at Coltrane Hall on campus to discuss what they could do to raise awareness about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larry Little, a professor at Winston-Salem State University, and other faculty members and the Rev. Carlton Eversley, a member of the Ministers Conference of Winston-Salem and Vicinity, helped the students brainstorm ideas and urged them to fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon may not be physically with us, but we can win this battle for justice,&quot; Little said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winston-Salem State students are planning a rally Wednesday. The details are still being worked out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Wake Forest University Black Law Students Association is hosting a candlelight vigil at 8 p.m. Monday in the law school's courtyard. S. Wayne Patterson, the president of the local chapter of the NAACP, Forsyth District Judge Denise Hartsfield and Walter Marshall, a Forsyth County commissioner, will be among the speakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are joining others across the country who have held demonstrations, demanding that Zimmerman be arrested and charged in Martin's killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darryl Hunt, who was exonerated in 2004 after spending nearly 19 years in prison for a murder that he did not commit, urged Winston-Salem State students to continue fighting for justice in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of students participated in a &quot;Hoodie Walk&quot; at Millersville University in Lancaster County Friday, seeking justice for 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. The Florida teen was walking home when he was gunned down by a neighborhood watchman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, Martin was wearing a hoodie and carrying a pack of skittles and an iced tea.  &quot;Hoodie Walk&quot; participants in an effort to show support followed suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wear hoodies all the time,&quot; said Saresa Williams, Millersville Junior.  &quot;This is a Millersville's hoodie. It could happen to anybody on campus, off-campus, anywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants walked from the Student Memorial Center, to the gym, and ended at the campus pond with a moment of silence and candle light vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is our brother,&quot; said Fen Alankus, Millersville Alum.  &quot;We don't know him. We don't know what he was thinking that day but we know he's one of us and that we care about him and we're here because we care about him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many students signed a petition that will be sent to Florida.  Students say they hope George Zimmerman, the man who killed Martin, will be brought to justice.   Zimmerman told police he shot Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Teen's killing spurs protests, remarks over wider issue.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cathy Karim recently came home to find her son and a friend doing something many mothers fear: talking outside in evening hours, wearing sweatshirts with hoods pulled up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I explained to them that they are black, and they shouldn't be outside with hoods up,&quot; said Karim, of Ellenwood. &quot;I said, 'It makes you look like a suspect.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She recalled that encounter Thursday morning at a service commemorating Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed, hoodie-wearing black teen shot to death by a neighbor in Florida last month. More than 100 people attended the 5:30 a.m. service at Atlanta's First Iconium Baptist Church. Afterward, many boarded buses for the eight-hour ride to an evening rally in Sanford, Fla., the community thrust into the national spotlight by Martin's killing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 17-year-old was shot on the evening of Feb. 26. He was returning to the home of his father's girlfriend from a nearby convenience store, where he had bought iced tea and Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corliss Burnett said his death struck her to the core because the circumstances were so ordinary. &quot;It just really puts in your face that it happened to this child, so it could happen to your child,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As protests over the killing swelled across the country in recent days, hoodies and Skittles have emerged as symbols of activism. Many at Atlanta's events brought the candy and wore sweatshirts that read, &quot;My hoodie does not mean I'm a criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That baby was crying for help,&quot; said former Atlanta City Councilman Derrick Boazman, referring to cries heard on 911 tapes of calls neighbors placed during the confrontation between Martin and the man who shot him, George Zimmerman. &quot;From Atlanta, from First Iconium Baptist Church, help is on the way,&quot; said Boazman, who coordinated the trip to Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman --- who told police he acted in self-defense although he was armed and Martin was not --- has not been charged with a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon is an episode in a series of injustices,&quot; said Marcus Coleman, president of the National Action Network Atlanta, which hosted another Atlanta rally Thursday night at Providence Missionary Baptist Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred people turned out at Thursday night's gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pastor Gerald Durley of the Providence Missionary Baptist Church said the slaying is not just about racism in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not about black and white, it is about right and wrong,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers urged supporters to call the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division about the case and to sign a petition on change.org demanding prosecution of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's killing has drawn comparisons to such infamous cases as the murder of Emmett Till, who was slain in Mississippi in the 1950s after reportedly flirting with a white woman. Thursday, others spoke of Ariston Waiters, who was shot twice in the back by a Union City police officer in December. No one has been charged in his death, and the Waiters family disputes police statements that their son was shot after a struggle for the officer's weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mothers attending the early morning event spoke of the rules they try to teach their children about living as blacks in America. Among them: always have your driver's license, registration and car insurance information on hand. Wearing a suit is safer than wearing casual clothes. Don't run down a street. Never run from police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's something we blacks have always lived with ... our children always have to be on guard,&quot; said Burnett, of Lithonia. She said she first taught her son about these issues when he was a boy. He is 38 now &quot;and he still goes by the rules.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beverly Dumas drove from Henry County to Atlanta well before dawn Thursday because &quot;to just complain and feel bad isn't enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is my son, he's my grandson. He's my brother, my nephew, my uncle, my fiance,&quot; she said. &quot;There are still people who fear African-Americans --- it's real and it's not going away as much as we want to ignore it or shy away from the subject.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Blackman, who is 72, said he was saddened, but not shocked by Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing surprises me at this age,&quot; said Blackman, of Stone Mountain. &quot;It just doesn't seem to be getting any better.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aftershocks of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's killing continued to reverberate Thursday from Sanford to South Florida, as the embattled police chief and state attorney overseeing the investigation stepped down hours after more than 1,000 Miami-Dade high school students staged a walkout to protest the lack of criminal charges in the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Corey, the state attorney for Duval, Nassau and Clay counties, will serve as special prosecutor in the case, Florida Gov. Rick Scott's office announced Thursday night. The government's statement suggested that Brevard-Seminole State Attorney Norm Wolfinger was forced out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott also created a statewide citizen task force to review Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor's news was welcomed with cheers by thousands of people gathered in a Sanford park to attend a rally with the Rev. Al Sharpton. Flanked by Trayvon's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, the celebrity activist said Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee's decision to temporarily step down was not enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't come here for a temporary leave of absence,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;We came here for permanent justice. Arrest Zimmerman now!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 28, was the neighborhood watch captain at the Retreat at Twin Lakes, a townhouse complex in the small town north of Orlando. A Hispanic former insurance agent with a history of reporting the presence of suspicious men to police, Zimmerman shot Trayvon in the chest Feb. 26. The killing came after Zimmerman called police saying he saw someone in a hoodie walking too slowly in the rain, peering at houses. He told police he was attacked and fired in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A general studies major at Seminole State College, Zimmerman was kicked out of the school Thursday &quot;due to the highly charged and high-profile controversy,&quot; the school announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanford Police Department is under fire for its handling of the investigation and for accepting the shooter's self-defense claim. Accused of lying to reporters and Trayvon's parents, protecting the shooter and ignoring key witnesses, Lee decided to step aside Thursday. His decision came a day after a 3-2 Sanford city commission vote of &quot;no confidence&quot; in the chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a former homicide investigator, career law enforcement officer and a father, I am keenly aware of the emotions associated with the tragic death of a child,&quot; Lee said at a brief news conference. &quot;While I stand by the Sanford Police Department, its personnel and the investigation that was conducted in regards to the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, it is apparent that my involvement in this matter is overshadowing the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two captains will run the department until an interim chief is chosen, City Manager Norton Bonaparte Jr. said. It was unclear whether Lee planned to return to the $102,000-a-year post.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager in Florida this week has triggered an anguished national dialogue, one that reached Pittsfield yesterday in the form of a rally at Park Square. The shooting raises uncomfortable questions about racism and justice in America, as well as the dangerous folly of permissive gun laws that invite needless tragedy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin, 17, was returning to a gated community in Sanford, Florida after a trip to a candy story when he was gunned down by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain who claimed that he was acting in self-defense. Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; gun law, like similar laws in 20 other states, enables gun owners to shoot first because they think they are threatened, which is basically a license to kill indiscriminately. Mr. Zimmerman has not been charged with a crime, which is, as Ty Allan Jackson, the organizer of the Park Square rally said in The Eagle, a &quot;slap in the face for people of color.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama said Friday the nation has &quot;some soul-searching&quot; to do and it begins with the racial stereotyping and paranoia that poison America. Americans must also ask why, in a nation where horrific gun violence is a routine event, the states and Washington continue to re spond with increasingly lenient gun laws that make it easy for fools and murderers to get weapons and use them on innocents. America must take back its streets from the killers and their misguided legislative enablers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PITTSFIELD -- Local residents, many in hooded sweatshirts and carrying signs, rallied Friday evening in support of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old Florida teenager who was gunned down by a neighborhood watch captain in February as he walked home from a convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As traffic passed around Park Square in Pittsfield, cars and trucks honked while many gave thumbs-up signs out their windows at the crowd of nearly 100 residents who held up signs that read &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot; and shouted &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;justice for Trayvon.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm here to show my support for Trayvon and his family,&quot; said city resident Sherrie Bethel McGregor. &quot;This could have been anyone's child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally was one of many that have been held across the nation as anger grows at the failure of Florida authorities to charge the shooter, George Zimmerman, 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman claimed self-defense in the Feb. 26 killing of Martin, who was unarmed at the time. The incident took place in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., a suburb of Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, on the phone with police dispatchers, told them that Martin looked suspicious. Against the dispatcher's advice, Zimmerman began following the young man who was wearing a hooded sweatshirt. After a confrontation between the two, Martin was shot and killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many at Friday evening's rally wore hooded sweatshirts, popularly known as &quot;hoodies&quot; to express solidarity with Martin and his family. They also passed out Skittles candies and canned ice tea -- the items that Martin was carrying when he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those at the Pittsfield event included the very young -- one woman had attached a sign to her baby stroller -- to the elderly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel bad,&quot; said Ajayi Jackson, a 12-year-old from Pittsfield. &quot;The guy hasn't even been arrested yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said many of his friends came to the rally to show their support for Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zimmerman should be charged with murder,&quot; said Eddie Taylor of Pittsfield, the executive director of S.E.E.D Network, the nonprofit social resource network that helped organize the event through its Facebook page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ty Allan Jackson, of Pittsfield, a local author who spearheaded the event, called Martin's killing &quot;a polarizing subject.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I knew it would be a good turnout,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event was to both bring awareness to the injustice done to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, but also to injustice in general, according to Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not an isolated incident, it's just a well-publicized one,&quot; he said. &quot;Injustice is happening every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also wanted the rally to provide a chance for the people of Berkshire County to know they have a voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They don't have to be afraid,&quot; said Jackson. &quot;It's a chance for them to be heard and be seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melissa Hosley, also of Pittsfield, said she came to bring awareness for equality, as well as justice for Martin. But beyond that, she said, Martin's killing touches upon many other areas, including gun control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot has to do with guns,&quot; she said. &quot;There needs to be more regulation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in attendance on Friday was Berkshire County state Rep. Tricia Farley-Bouvier, D-Pittsfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is my district. I represent all these people. They are out here seeking justice in a peaceful way,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm always willing to support that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama weighed in Friday, calling the shooting death a &quot;tragedy&quot; and saying every aspect of the case should be investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor said he was happy the president was &quot;stepping up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president realizes 'but for the grace of God, goes my child,' &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department and FBI have opened a civil rights investigation, and a grand jury is set to convene April 10 to determine whether Zimmerman should be charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Material from The Associated Press was used in this report.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Carolina bill would remove a right to deadly force</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - A newly proposed bill in South Carolina would remove a legal protection giving people the right to use deadly force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denmark Rep. Bakari Sellers said Thursday he wants to remove the &quot;stand your ground&quot; provision from the state law that deals with personal property protections. Sellers' bill would strike language saying someone who isn't breaking the law and is somewhere he has the right to be, like where he works, has the right to use deadly force to protect himself or someone else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provision became law in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sellers said he was inspired to introduce the bill after the death of Trayvon Martin. The black Florida teenager was shot to death by a Hispanic neighborhood watch captain who has not been charged and said he shot in self-defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1206 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 23--Over 9,000 people are murdered in the United States every year. Therefore, it takes extraordinary circumstances -- like a mother (Casey Anthony) killing her child -- for any of them to become a cause cel&Atilde;&uml;bre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances surrounding the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin are extraordinary to say the least. (One can be forgiven for thinking he was only 11 based on pictures that have been popping up everywhere this week....)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, the facts are very straightforward and undisputed:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was shot dead on February 26 just yards from his home in Sanford, Florida by George Zimmerman, a trigger-happy neighborhood watchdog. Zimmerman claims that he feared Trayvon was an armed burglar on the prowl. In fact Trayvon was just walking home from a neighborhood store armed with nothing but his mobile phone, some skittles candy, and an iced tea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason these facts are undisputed is that a number of eyewitnesses called 911 when they heard Trayvon crying out in despair as cop-wannabe Zimmerman was attempting to detain/arrest him. Indeed, that Trayvon could be heard crying &quot;help, help&quot; on the 911 tapes is what gives this case its heart-wrenching pathos. It is also what belies Zimmerman's claim that he shot Trayvon in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to mention that Zimmerman's own call to 911 indicts him. Because no matter the wild-west nature of Florida's &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; self-defense law, that Zimmerman clearly stalked and then confronted Trayvon -- after being told by the 911 operator not to -- impeaches his claim. And this is so even if Trayvon managed to knock him on his ass and bust his nose before Zimmerman shot him dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is an excerpt from that damning 911 call:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: Hey we've had some break-ins in my neighborhood, and there's a real suspicious guy... This guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dispatcher: Okay, and this guy is he white, black, or Hispanic?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: He looks black... they always get away... he's running...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dispatcher: Are you following him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: Yeah</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dispatcher: Okay, we don't need you to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: Okay... (Mother Jones, March 18, 2012)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, we now know that he lied. Because he continued following Trayvon in &quot;hot pursuit&quot; -- as if he were in fact a police officer. Which makes this provision in his own Neighborhood Watch guide so relevant:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manual from the Neighborhood Watch program states: 'It should be emphasized to members that they do not possess police powers. And they shall not carry weapons or pursue vehicles.' (ABC News, March 20, 2012)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, there was late-breaking news on Wednesday that Trayvon was on the phone with his teenage girlfriend from the time Zimmerman began following him to when he physically confronted him. According to reports, she says they were merely engaging in puppy-love talk before he expressed concern about some man following him, and that it was she who told him to run home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point is that her account belies all of Zimmerman's alleged suspicions about Trayvon casing places to burglarize. Not least because it includes her actually hearing Zimmerman commanding to know &quot;what are you doing around here?&quot; and Trayvon repeatedly pleading &quot;why you following me?&quot; ... until a scuffle breaks out and Trayvon's phone goes dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given these facts and circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the failure of the Sanford police to arrest him has caused such national and international outrage. Never mind that, but for this story going viral on social media, the local police chief would probably have gotten away with declaring this shooting justified. As things stand, however, Zimmerman is now almost as much a wanted man as Joseph Kony ... remember him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt this notoriety and calls for protesters to march on Sanford are what forced not just the Florida state attorney general but even the Department of Justice on Wednesday to announce plans to launch separate investigations. And I am convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that the outcome will be Zimmerman's arrest, trial, and conviction in due course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incidentally, his attorney is bound to assert an insanity defense given Zimmerman's psychotic suspicion of black males -- evidenced by reports that he made over 40 false-alarm calls to 911 over the past year to report blacks on the prowl. But there's a legal chasm between being certifiably insane and being a vigilante bigot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His insanity defense will fail; not least because he not only knew the difference between right and wrong, the 911 made it clear to him that just following this kid was wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, his family members are laboring to disabuse the public of the reasonable suspicion that Zimmerman was racially motivated. They cite his Hispanic heritage, black family members, and black friends as evidence in this respect. Except that anyone who does not think Hispanics can be racist towards Blacks should speak with blacks who experience this form of racism every day in certain areas of Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I must confess though that much of the outrage fueling blacks like me is the Jim-Crow realization that there but for the grace of God, go I ... or my son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the same, I am concerned about firebrands like Reverend Al Sharpton making this more a case about black civil rights than about the murder of an innocent black kid -- in a cold-blooded case of vigilante justice. After all, the last thing this country needs is to have blacks and Hispanics becoming polarized along racial lines in this case the way blacks and whites were after O.J. Simpson murdered his wife and her best friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to mention that proving this was a civil rights violation instead of manslaughter is fraught with legal hurdles and factual uncertainties (i.e., his racial profiling and epithets do not necessarily amount to race-based malice in this case).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, I urge Sharpton to enlist Hispanic leaders to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with him at his &quot;no justice, no peace&quot; rallies to diffuse any sparks of racial conflict between these two minority groups before race-based emotions explode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, perhaps the only good thing that will come out of this case is that the Florida legislature (with prodding from the Department of Justice) will be compelled to modify its stand-your-ground law, which emboldens people to shoot to kill based merely on their subjective fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Especially since the Sanford police seem to think that it's okay to use deadly force even if that fear is not of personal bodily harm, but of black kids just walking home in their own neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, given the way this police department botched (or covered up) this case, it was hardly surprising that Sanford's Police Chief Bill Lee was forced to resign &quot;temporarily&quot; just yesterday. He stands by his investigation, but he would be hard-pressed to explain why, amongst other things, he ordered the dead boy to be tested for drugs and alcohol but not the shooter...?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frankly, this police chief is delusional if he thinks he'll be a police chief in Sanford (or any other city in America) ever again.</SPAN></P>

We need to ask whether 'Stand Your Ground' measures make people trigger-happy. And we need to think about the most common victims of lax gun laws: African Americans.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a big cloud gathering, just beyond the horizon. It started a few weeks ago over Sanford, Fla. Now it's everywhere, darkening with anger and outrage. You might even call it a storm cloud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm referring to the burst of Tweeting, Facebooking, and other social networking to protest the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by George Zimmerman, captain of an informal neighborhood watch group, in Sanford on Feb. 26. Without the cloud, most of us wouldn't know that Martin was African American, and Zimmerman isn't. And far fewer people would be up in arms about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I also fear that it might be clouding the real arms issue - that is, the problem of firearms. This tragedy is about race, of course, but it's also about guns. And by focusing so heavily on the former, I fear, we're blinding ourselves to the latter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, we've heard criticism of the Florida &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which allows citizens to use deadly force if they have reasonable fear of harm or death. And we're sure to hear more debate over the next few weeks about whether Mr. Zimmerman, who says he acted in self defense, had any real reason to fear Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, who was carrying nothing more dangerous than iced tea and Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if you look at the social-media protests about the event, almost none of them target Florida's gun law itself. Signed by nearly 1.5 million people, the most popular online petition simply calls for charges to be filed against George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ditto for the loud public demonstrations unleashed by the furor on the Net. In New York, a &quot;Million Hoodie March&quot; echoed the petition's demand for Zimmerman's arrest. And in Florida, a protest urged state officials to withdraw his concealed weapons permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Got that? The problem isn't that Florida lets people carry concealed weapons, or that it allows them to kill on questionable pretexts. Instead, it just let the wrong guy have a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we need to ask whether any private citizen should be carrying a concealed weapon, and whether &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; measures make people trigger-happy. And most of all, we need to think about the most common victims of our lax gun laws: African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationwide, blacks are far more likely to die from firearms than are white people. Not surprisingly, then, African Americans also favor gun control more than whites do. In a 2010 poll by the Pew Research Center, asking people whether it was more important to &quot;protect gun rights&quot; or &quot;control gun ownership,&quot; 53 percent of whites chose gun rights and 39 percent selected gun control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among African Americans, by contrast, just 27 percent deemed gun ownership rights more important; meanwhile, a whopping 64 percent called gun control the more important goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These numbers don't sit well with the gun lobby, which has often suggested that strict gun control actually discriminates against racial minorities. Its evidence? Some of our earliest restrictions on guns barred African Americans from owning them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's true. And it's also irrelevant. Especially in the years right after the Civil War, racist whites strove to keep guns out of black hands. But it hardly follows that today's gun-control laws are racist, or that African Americans would be safer if they armed themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ditto the irrelevancy of the often-cited facts that the militant Black Panthers protested California's gun-control laws, and that even the famed pacifist Martin Luther King, Jr. applied for a gun license in the late 1950s after his house was firebombed. Not surprisingly, the white-supremacist government in his native Alabama rejected the request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that same state racism was precisely the reason that King wanted a weapon. Today, 40 years after the civil rights revolution, it's hard to argue that our governmental institutions purposefully menace black Americans; indeed, we have a black American in the White House. The real danger to blacks lies in the private sphere - especially in gun-carrying citizens like George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because we share the same last name, I've received a barrage of emails asking if I'm related to Zimmerman. So far as I know, I'm not. But he and I live in the same nation, the United States of America, where it's easier to get a gun than in almost any other developed country on earth. And racial minorities pay the highest price for that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I hope our Tweeters and Facebookers keep pressuring authorities in Florida and the US Department of Justice, which recently announced an investigation of the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. We need to know what really happened in Sanford on Feb. 26, and nobody should rest until we do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, though, I also hope social networkers will demand tighter controls on the purchase and use of firearms. As gun lobbyists like to say, guns don't kill; people do. But people are more likely to kill if they have a gun, and black people are more likely to get killed as a result. We need a break in the cloud, to make room for that discussion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One sentiment was clear among the thousands who rallied Thursday night for action in last month's fatal shooting of an unarmed Florida teenager: justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader Al Sharpton helped lead the charge, demanding the arrest of neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's killing in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot allow a precedent when a man can just kill one of us ... and then walk out with the murder weapon,&quot; Sharpton said, flanked by Martin's parents and a stage full of supporters. &quot;We don't want good enough. We want George Zimmerman in court with handcuffs behind his back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN PICTURES: Trayvon&nbsp;Martin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally came the same day that bitterly criticized Police Chief Bill Lee stepped down temporarily, he said to help quell the rising passions surrounding the case. Hours later, Gov. Rick Scott announced that the county prosecutor also had recused himself from the case and that a state attorney from Jacksonville would take over the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton attended the rally just hours after the death of his mother. &quot;This is where she would want me to be,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was joined by Martin's parents, Martin Luther King III and nationally syndicated radio host Michael Baisden whose encouragement to his Twitter followers helped escalate attention on the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin lived in Miami and was in Sanford visiting family Feb. 26 when he went to a convenience store. He was walking back carrying a bag of Skittles candy and can of iced tea, the hood of his jacket pulled over his head because it was raining. He was approached by the 28-year-old Zimmerman, who told a police dispatcher he thought Martin looked suspicious. Zimmerman shot Martin following a chase and fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman says he shot Martin in self-defense, and Sanford police officials say there is no evidence that contradicts that. Some neighbors in the gated community have praised Zimmerman for taking a stand against crime in the neighborhood that is 57 percent white and 30 percent black. Police say Zimmerman is white; his family says he's Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, believe Zimmerman should have been arrested. They claim he was profiling their son and acted like a vigilante.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally was initially planned for a 400-seat church. But it was moved to downtown to make room for all the people who stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Fort Mellon Park, many holding signs with everything from &quot;Justice For Trayvon&quot; to &quot;Chief is gone, Zimmerman is next.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fulton was teary-eyed when she addressed the crowd, telling them &quot;we want justice for Trayvon&quot; before referencing a popular Bible verse when she said she had been reminded to &quot;trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not on thy own understanding&quot; during the past month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Martin thanked the rally goers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Trayvon were here, he would have been here tonight,&quot; he said. &quot;He was a people person. Let's get justice for your son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Familiar chants like &quot;No justice, no peace&quot; were also sung throughout the night. At least four charter buses from Atlanta brought rally goers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents both spoke to the crowd just hours after they sat down with Scott who announced that the local state attorney, Norman Wolfinger, had recused himself from the case. In a letter to Scott, Wolfinger said that while he thought he could fairly oversee any prosecution that develops in the case, his recusal was aimed at &quot;toning down the rhetoric and preserving the integrity of the investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott appointed Angela B. Corey, the state attorney for the Jacksonville area, to take over the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That announcement by the attorney for Martin's parents brought a loud cheer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've still gotta hold everybody accountable until there's an arrest,&quot; attorney Benjamin Crump beckoned the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton took up an impromptu monetary collection for Martin's parents. He started it off with a $2,500 pledge and he was joined by Greg Mathis and Baisden who both pledged $10,000 each. Former New York Gov. David Paterson also gave $2,000. Paterson was among several state and national politicians at the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buckets were also passed throughout the crowd with Sharpton telling them &quot;Y'all show the world we're gonna finance our own movement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a brief moment of booing, when Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett addressed the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown quickly quieted it when she told them how Triplett flew to Washington, D.C., and met with congressmen for five hours about the case and helped get the 911 tapes released to the public, which generated a social media buzz that propelled the case nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now we are working on this issue,&quot; she said. &quot;And everybody didn't want him working on this issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN PICTURES: Trayvon&nbsp;Martin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown also announced that they hope to have hearings in Washington with the Justice Department about the case as early as Tuesday. The FBI is looking into what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dick Gregory, a comedian who uses humor to convey his civil rights message, said the steady pressure should be the goal going forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All you have to do is be a turtle,&quot; he said. &quot;Hard on the outside, soft on the inside and willing to stick your neck out.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE EMBATTLED police chief of Sanford, Fla., stepped aside Thursday amid international condemnation of his refusal to arrest the man who shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am aware my role as leader of this department has become a distraction,&quot; Police Chief Bill Lee said in a brief statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said &quot;temporarily removing&quot; himself would restore a &quot;semblance of calm to the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee is the second Sanford chief to step down in a racial furor in just 10 months: The previous chief was forced out after he didn't arrest a white cop's son who beat up a black homeless man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford city commissioners voted 3-2 Wednesday that they had lost confidence in Lee, who insisted there was no probable cause to arrest George Zimmerman, the Hispanic neighborhood watchman who killed Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old, on Feb 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee's announcement came just hours before thousands rallied in the Orlando suburb, and did not mollify the angry crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did not come here for a temporary leave of absence,&quot; said the Rev. Al Sharpton. &quot;We came here for an arrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zimmerman should have been arrested that night,&quot; Sharpton told the teeming crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot allow a legal precedent to be established in this city that allows anyone to kill us, tell any story he wants, and walk out with the murder weapon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was joined by most of the nation's leading civil rights activists and a raft of elected officials and pastors who donated more than $50,000 for the Martin family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are our strength,&quot; Trayvon's father, Tracy Martin, told the crowd, which chanted &quot;we want an arrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With national outrage over the killing still growing, Florida Gov. Rick Scott replaced the state attorney probing the case with a special prosecutor. He also said a task force would reexamine the state's controversial law that allows a person to shoot to kill if they say they feel threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman said Trayvon jumped him and claimed self-defense. Cops never took him into custody or tested him for drugs or alcohol - though they tested the teen's corpse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee continued to say cops did the right thing even after it emerged that calls to 911 from worried neighbors captured the teen's desperate cries for help and a single gunshot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman can also be heard on tape telling a police dispatcher he was following the boy, who had gone out to buy candy wearing a hoodie on a drizzly Sunday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though his voice is muffled and the tape scratchy, some believe they can make him out swearing about &quot;coons&quot; on the tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police are accused of overlooking more evidence: even though they had the dead boy's cell phone, it was Trayvon's father who discovered by poring over phone records that his son was talking to his girlfriend moments before he died. The girlfriend confirmed that Trayvon said he was being followed and was scared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though he lost his mother late Wednesday, Sharpton said he had to come to the rally to support Trayvon's mother, Sybrina Fulton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My mother raised me to stand up for justice,&quot; he said. &quot;Sons are supposed to bury their mothers. Mothers are not supposed to bury their sons.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old &quot;captain&quot; of his neighborhood watch, shot and killed an unarmed 17-year-old black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin, watching a basketball game in a home in a gated community, decided to walk to a store to buy iced tea and candy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He never returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the shooting happened almost a month ago, the police have neither arrested nor charged the shooter. But pressure to do so grows more intense by the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One petition calling for Zimmerman's arrest has drawn a million signatures. A Million Hoodie March - Martin was wearing one when shot - just took place in New York, where protesters demanded Zimmerman's arrest, and some want him charged for a racially-motivated murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department announced an investigation, and a Florida grand jury will also examine the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many already call Zimmerman a murderer, protected by an insular, close-minded, small-town law enforcement community. But, understandable emotion aside, whether a prosecutor can persuade a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman is a murderer is not an easy proposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman apparently volunteered for the job to watch the neighborhood and had called 911 multiple times in the previous months to complain about suspicious activity. In Zimmerman's 911 call that night, he described Martin as black - in response to the dispatcher's question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman also told 911 that &quot;these a--holes always get away.&quot; He mutters, under his breath, something that might be a racial slur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More problematic for Zimmerman is that he was in his car following Martin while talking to 911 - and the dispatcher told him not to leave his car to pursue, and to let the police handle it. But he got out of his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a scuffle. Martin's girlfriend, who was on the phone with him as Zimmerman was following the teen, says that Martin was attacked without provocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida is a &quot;shall issue&quot; state that allows citizens to apply for a permit to carry a concealed weapon. Zimmerman had a permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, Florida is one of almost two dozen other states with a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law. Florida's law, passed in 2005, says a person who is attacked in a place &quot;where he or she has a right to be&quot; can use deadly force &quot;if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it illegal to follow someone in public? Is it illegal to get out of a car and pursue when advised not to? Did Zimmerman reasonably believe his life in danger when he shot?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Absent more, do a white shooter and black victim automatically mean hate crime?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a lot we do not know. This should be about justice - and not about &quot;my race right or wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, it seems, no rejected idea bad enough that it won't keep rearing its head over an over again with lawmakers. Maybe lobbying groups think if you just keep repeating the same words over and over again -- words like &quot;personhood amendment&quot; or &quot;concealed carry reciprocity&quot; -- folks will get confused into thinking such well-worn terms are already law. Perhaps then they will pass them, if only due to exhaustion.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, a bill that would force every state to honor any other states' laws regarding concealed carry permits for guns -- no matter how weak those laws are -- is being considered in Congress. Thus the weakest laws in the nation would trump the laws of every other state.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Actually, make that two competing bills. Talk about repetition.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Both bills are presented by Senate Republicans with the backing of the National Rifle Association.<BR><BR><BR><BR> We urge Sens. Mark Udall and Michael Bennet to voice their opposition to these bills. Similar bills have failed in Congress in the past.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Consider Colorado's laws: You can get a permit to carry a concealed weapon within the state. Within our borders, so can permit holders from the majority of American states, which have laws that meet or exceed our concealed carry rules. Some of them: You have to be 21 or older, you can't have been judged mentally incompetent, you can't have said you want to murder a bunch of people or be a chronic alcoholic. There are 18 states with lax permit rules, and we don't recognize those permits. If these bills pass, people who haven't had a background check and those who wouldn't get a permit in Colorado -- no way, no how -- can just bring in their hidden, loaded guns from out of state.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Much more importantly, one could obtain a permit from any old state, with Colorado being forced to honor it. Utah saw 70 percent of its permits in 2010 issued to people who don't live in Utah, according to of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, more than 625 mayors representing more than 50 million Americans, who oppose the national reciprocity bills.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Boulder Mayor Matthew Appelbaum, and Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock are part of that group.<BR><BR><BR><BR> The tragic case of the Florida neighborhood watchman with a violent criminal record, George Zimmerman, who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager, Trayvon Martin, should be a wakeup call. On Thursday, the Sanford, Fla., police chief Bill Lee said he was stepping down temporarily and the case is headed for a grand jury.<BR><BR><BR><BR> But what the tragedy should illustrate is how carefully many gun laws are written just to protect gun owners -- the quick, but not the dead. Florida issues concealed carry permits to residents and non-residents online and through the mail. While Colorado recognizes Florida residents' concealed carry permits, it doesn't allow any non-resident holders of any state's permits to walk around with hidden, loaded guns here. If these bills pass, that won't matter at all.<BR><BR><BR><BR> -- Erika Stutzman, for<BR><BR> the Camera editorial board  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A FLORIDA state prosecutor has joined the local police chief in stepping down over the decision not to arrest a neighbourhood watchman who shot dead an unarmed black teenager on his way home from a convenience store. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governor Rick Scott made the announcement after more than 10,000 people gathered in Stanford to protest at a &quot;blatant disregard for justice&quot; in the city's response to the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader Al Sharpton, whose TV show helped bring the killing to national attention, told the crowd: &quot;Trayvon represents a reckless disregard for our lives that we've seen for too long. Investigate the entire police department now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's father, Tracy, said: &quot;We want an arrest, we want a conviction and we want him sentenced for the murder of my son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was killed on February 26 by volunteer warden George Zimmerman, 28, who claimed he shot in self-defence under Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law that enables people to use deadly force when they believe they are in danger in a public place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the protesters carried signs saying: &quot;100 years of lynching, justifiable homicide. Same thing.&quot; Others sold T-shirts that read: &quot;Arrest Zimmerman.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has reignited the debate over race in the US after the teenager was found to be carrying only some sweets called Skittles and a can of iced tea; witnesses reported that Zimmerman chased Martin through a housing estate. Zimmerman had called police to report a &quot;suspicious guy&quot; and followed him despite the dispatcher's advice not to do so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told police Martin attacked him after he had given up on chasing the teenager and was returning to his sport utility vehicle. Police say Zimmerman is white, his family say he is Hispanic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Lee, chief of Stanford Police, said he was temporarily standing aside &quot;to restore some semblance of calm to the city which has been in turmoil.&quot; He had suffered a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote from the city commission on Wednesday over his handling of the case. Governor Scott told reporters that state attorney Norman Wolfinger will step down and he had also formed a task force to review the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law in light of the shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dubbed the &quot;shoot first, ask questions later&quot; law by critics, it is seen by some as encouraging vigilante justice. A Florida grand jury is considering whether there is enough evidence to press charges, and the US justice department has launched an investigation into the police handling of  the case. Nearly a million people have signed online petitions calling for  justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year another Sanford police chief had to resign after a white policeman's son was captured on video sucker-punching a black homeless man outside a bar.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Attorney Angela Corey of Jacksonville will take over the investigation into the shooting death in Sanford of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Gov. Rick Scott's office announced Thursday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a news release by Scott's office, the governor and state Attorney General Pam Bondi asked State Attorney Norman Wolfinger to step aside in favor of Corey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe Gov. Scott is very comfortable with the level of homicide prosecution that I have done myself,&quot; Corey said, &quot;and he knows that we handle a lot of homicides and a lot of issues with justifiable use of deadly force.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfinger cited his reason for stepping down from the investigation as arising from a &quot;conflict of interest,&quot; which Corey said is common and can come from a variety of circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey said she has assigned two of her top prosecutors, Bernie de la Rionda and John Guy, to conduct the investigation along with one of her most experienced investigators. The team is traveling to Sanford today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda said he would not speculate on his plans in the investigation, particularly in regard to Wolfinger's decision to have a grand jury review the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it's appropriate for us to comment about the facts until we know the facts,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey said she has so far spoken only to the governor, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the attorney general but has not yet spoken to Wolfinger or any other authorities in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All cases where self defense is claimed are a challenge, Corey said. &quot; ... Anytime there's remotely a possibility of any affirmative defense in a homicide case, we like to get right on top of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee temporarily stepped down Thursday, saying he had become a distraction to the investigation. Lee has been heavily criticized after his officers decided not to arrest George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who shot the unarmed black teen to death on Feb. 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott also asked Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll to head a task force that will review the state's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task force, Scott said in a statement, &quot;will thoroughly review Florida's 'Stand Your Ground' law and any other laws, rules, regulations or programs that relate to public safety and citizen protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As law enforcement investigates the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Floridians and others around the country have rightly recognized this as a terrible tragedy,&quot; Scott said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, a Miami-Dade judge cited the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law in tossing out the case of a man who chased down a suspected burglar and stabbed him to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee's decision to step down temporarily came less than a day after city commissioners gave him a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote, and after a couple of weeks of protests and uproar on social media websites. Lee has said evidence in the case supported Zimmerman's claim that the Feb. 26 shooting of Martin was self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do this in the hopes of restoring some semblance of calm to a city which has been in turmoil for several weeks,&quot; Lee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was returning from a trip to a convenience store when Zimmerman started following him, telling police dispatchers he looked suspicious. At some point, the two got into a fight and Zimmerman pulled out his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told police Martin attacked him after he had given up on chasing the teenager and was returning to his sport utility vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting ignited racial tensions in the town near Orlando. Civil rights groups have held rallies in Florida and New York, saying the shooting was unjustified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't clear how long the police chief would step aside.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Governor Rick Scott appointed a task force on Thursday to investigate the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin as calls grew for charges to be filed against the neighbourhood watch volunteer who killed him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the state prosecutor who had been handling the investigation will step aside from the probe, Scott said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to examining the Martin incident, the task force &quot;will thoroughly review Florida's 'Stand Your Ground' law,&quot; Scott said. The 2005 law, which has come under national scrutiny since the Martin killing, allows someone in fear of &quot;great bodily harm&quot; to respond with deadly force, and removes any duty to retreat if possible to avoid confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier on Thursday, the police chief of Sanford, the town where Martin was killed, announced he would temporarily step down from his job, saying his role in the investigation had become too much of a distraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee had been heading up the investigation into the killing of 17-year-old Martin by neighbourhood watch captain George Zimmerman, 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have declined to arrest Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee, who has been on the job less than a year, said it had become &quot;apparent that my involvement in the matter is overshadowing the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee's decision to step down comes a day after he received a vote of &quot;no confidence&quot; by Sanford's city commissioners and follows calls for his resignation by civil-rights groups angered over the police department's handling of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turner Clayton, president of the Seminole County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said he was relieved to see Lee step aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The city commission made a good start last night,&quot; he said. &quot;Based on that, the chief had no other recourse but to remove himself. We hope it becomes permanent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee previously said he had no choice under Florida's controversial Stand-Your-Ground law but to let Zimmerman go free. The 2005 law allows someone in fear of &quot;great bodily harm&quot; to respond with deadly force, and removes any duty to retreat if possible to avoid confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Feb. 26, Martin was returning to a gated community from a candy run at a convenience store when Zimmerman, carrying a licensed handgun in his role as a neighbourhood watch captain, saw him. He called police to report a &quot;suspicious guy&quot; and followed him despite the dispatcher's advice not to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbours said they heard a scuffle, cries for help and then a gunshot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President urges authorities to look into 'every aspect' of teen's death and says: 'If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon' <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama made his first public remarks on the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, saying that the Florida teenager's death was a &quot;tragedy&quot; that needed to be fully investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a personal message delivered from the White House, the US president likened Trayvon&nbsp;Martin to his own children, and said: &quot;If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama vowed that authorities would look into &quot;every aspect&quot; of the shooting of the unarmed 17-year-old by neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman, and called on federal, state and local authorities to work together as part of the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was killed on February 26 in circumstances that have yet to be fully explained. Although Zimmerman admits he killed the teenager, he says it was in self-defence, citing Florida's controversial &quot;stand your ground&quot; law that allows the use of lethal force in certain circumstances. Zimmerman has not been arrested, sparking growing anger that has spread beyond Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's intervention was prompted by a question from reporters during a White House announcement on its nominee for head of the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously this is a tragedy. I can only imagine what these parents are going through,&quot; he said from the White House Rose Garden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids, and I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said that all of America had some &quot;soul searching&quot; to do over the incident, adding: &quot;If I had a son he would look like Trayvon and I think they [his parents] are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney later joined the president in calling for a &quot;thorough investigation&quot;. He added that a full inquiry was needed so that &quot;justice is carried out with impartiality and integrity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera sparked outrage on Friday when he claimed that Martin was singled out for attention because he was wearing a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling on parents of black and Latino youngsters to prevent their children going out onto the streets in hooded sweatshirts, Rivera added: &quot;I think the hoodie is as much responsible for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death as George Zimmerman was&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement received an immediate backlash online, as critics took to twitter to vent their anger. Rivera later tweeted that his son had messaged him to say he was ashamed of his position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus on black and Latino youths by Rivera also reinforced the view held by some that the incident may have had a racial element to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford's police chief Bill Lee stepped down temporarily on Thursday. The announcement was followed by news that Florida state attorney Norman Wolfinger had also recused himself following criticism of his handling of the case. But neither move appeared to soothe the growing discontent or quieten calls for Zimmerman to be arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday night a rally was held in Sanford, the city in which Martin was shot dead as he returned to the home of his father's girlfriend after a trip to a local convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the demonstration, the 17-year-old's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, were joined by civil rights leaders including the Rev Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton told those gathered: &quot;We cannot allow a precedent when a man can just kill one of us and then walk out with the murder weapon. We want George Zimmerman in court with handcuffs behind his back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10.15am: Good morning, it's Friday, a lovely day for politics. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tom McCarthy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> here in New York and welcome to our live blog coverage. My colleague </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ryan Devereaux</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> starts us off with a survey of the latest developments:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[#xfffd] </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rick Santorum is on his way to a substantial victory in tomorrow's Louisiana tomorrow</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - that's the prediction of the Democratic polling organization Public Policy Polling. Their poll has Santorum up 42%-28% over Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[#xfffd] </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mitt Romney has an op-ed in USA Today calling for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - known to its enemies as Obamacare - regardless of whether the Supreme Court strikes the legislation down. You can read it here. In 2009, Romney penned an op-ed in the same paper on the same issue, urging Obama to look to Massachusetts as a model. This time around, Romney has streamlined his argument. He writes, &quot;When I was governor of Massachusetts, we instituted a plan that got our citizens insured without raising taxes and without a government takeover. Other states will choose to go in different directions. It is the genius of federalism that it encourages experimentation, with each state pursuing what works best for them. ObamaCare's disregard for this core aspect of U.S. tradition is one of its most egregious failings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[#xfffd] </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The failed presidential campaign of Rep. Michele Bachmann is $1 million in debt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maybe she can turn to Mitt Romney, who helped take care of former rival Tim Pawlenty's presidential campaign debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[#xfffd] </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ron Paul has inserted himself into the Etch A Sketch controversy that has consumed the GOP race of late.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a powerful 41 second video posted yesterday, the Paul campaign suggests the growing concern over the child's toy might actually be less important than other &quot;problems&quot; facing the country right now. The ad asks the viewer, &quot;Tired of the games? . . . Ron Paul 2012: A serious plan to restore America now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10.22am: In an announcement at the White House moments ago, President Obama tapped Dartmouth President Jim Yong Kim to be the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">new head of the World Bank</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Kim had not been widely named as a leading candidate for the post, but his selection was hailed as a creative and canny move by the president. Here's Slate economics writer Matt Yglesias:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I still wish the Obama administration had gone outside the box and tapped a non-American to lead the World Bank, but their actual selection Dartmouth President Jim Yong Kim seems like a very strong dark horse candidate. As a former director of the Department of HIV/AIDS at the World Health Organization he has some of the necessary experience with international organizations, and his general expertise in the field of public health and infectious diseases is rightly focused on the area where development assistance has the clearest track record of success and potential for future gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, though he's lived in the United States since the age of 5, he was actually born in South Korea so there's at least a little crack in the door of the American monopoly on the Bank Presidency. Given that the developing world's two candidates for the job at the moment are coming from Africa and Latin America, nominating an Asian-American also seems like a potentially clever nod in the direction of Asia's rising importance in the global economy while maintaining the basic EU/US hegemony over the Bretton-Woods institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10.31am: After announcing his pick for the new head of the World Bank, President Obama spoke about the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Trayvon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Martin,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the black teen shot dead by a neighborhood watch zealot in Sanford, Florida. The shooter, George Zimmerman, was allowed to leave the scene of the killing and has not been arrested. My colleague </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Matt Williams</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has the president's remarks:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously this is a tragedy, we can only imagine what these parents are going through. And when I think about this boy, I think about my own kids and I think every person in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative we investigate every aspect of this to find out exactly how this tragedy happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of us have to do some soul searching to discover how something like this happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I had a son he would look like Trayvon, and I think they (his parents) are right to expect that all of us as Americans will watch this with the seriousness it deserves and we will get to the bottom of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10.50am: Here is video of President Obama's remarks on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Trayvon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Martin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11.16am: Let's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">check in on the candidates</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (still plural) for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. For once they're easy to find: All four are in Louisiana, campaigning away in advance of tomorrow's primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Here's a stumper: When was the last time all four candidates were in one state together on the same day? Ron Paul is the tough one to pin down; remember he skipped Florida. Let's crowd source this: let us know in the comments when the last time was that the stars aligned this way and... and then we can all pat ourselves on the back.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney got off to a quick start this morning by taking the stump and committing embarrassing dad moment No. 14,293. He dropped a &quot;y'all&quot; - and then stutteringly corrected himself and said he wasn't trying to pretend he was from Louisiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will there be a tipping point, after which Romney's helpless inability to avoid these kinds of awkward moments will become sort of endearing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After saying &quot;Y'all,' Romney corrections himself: &quot;Y'all. You all. I mean you all. I'm not trying to pretend like I'm from Louisiana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Ashley Parker(@AshleyRParker) March 23, 2012</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11.29am: As for Rick Santorum, he's hosting a rally at Ouachita Sheriff's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Shooting Range</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Monroe, La. The candidate is handling guns for the cameras. For better or for worse (let's just say for worse) this kind of posing has become the norm for American politicians courting the NRA vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the optics are different this morning. Santorum is at a shooting range and talking about fundamental freedom while the president is at the White House talking about the killing of an unarmed kid by a zealot packing a legal concealed firearm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poignant juxtaposition - or maybe not; maybe just a meaningless accident of timing. But then someone in the audience at the firing range draws a connection that completes the circle - guns and politics and race and violence - urging Santorum preparing to fire at a target to &quot;pretend it's Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santorum has spoken before about his rules for managing or correcting an audience. In January a woman at a Florida Santorum event stood up and said of the president, &quot;He is an avowed Muslim and my question is, why isn't something being done to get him out of our government?&quot; Santorum responded: &quot;Believe me ... I'm doing everything I can to get him out of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later Santorum explained why he hadn't corrected the woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not my responsibility as a candidate to correct everybody who makes a statement that I disagree with,&quot; Santorum told reporters. &quot;There are lots of people who get up and say stuff in a town hall meeting and say things that I don't agree with, but I don't think it's my obligation, nor should it be your feeling that it's my obligation to correct somebody who says something that I don't agree with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12.06pm: Fellow Republicans have opened fire on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rick Santorum</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for his comments yesterday equating a vote for Mitt Romney to a vote for President Obama. Conservative blogger Ed Morrissey took Santorum to the woodshed in an animated post this morning:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that Senator Santorum has forgotten the purpose of the Republican primary. It's to choose the most successful candidate to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">beat Obama in the general election.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It isn't to test a few candidates to see whether the goal of beating Obama is worth the bother. [emphasis in original]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santorum devoted part of his stump speech in Louisiana this morning to beating back the notion that he would ever equate Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santorum: &quot;I would never vote for Barack Obama over any Republican and to suggest otherwise is preposterous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Ethan Klapper (@ethanklapper) March 23, 2012</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You be the judge. Here's what Santorum said yesterday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You win by giving people the opportunity to see a different vision for our country, not someone who's just going to be a little different than the person in there. If you're going to be a little different, we might as well stay with what we have instead of taking a risk with what may be the Etch A Sketch candidate of the future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom, you're doing a fine job but we're concerned about Richard Adams. Is he scouring the planet for the last remaining jars of that fake Vegemite stuff from New Zealand? (I think they actually call it Marmite, but calling it Marmite doesn't make it Marmite. Not genuine Marmite.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good question! We did see Richard last week and can gladly report that he appeared a vision of health and good humor. Not an unusual state of play for Mr. Adams, but heightened perhaps by the fact that he was about to head off on holiday - whether to his palatial Hamptons estate or another of his various international compounds is unclear - to return a week Monday. There was no mention of Marmite, thankfully. We hope that whatever he's up to proves extravagantly restful, because we have the feeling that it's going to be a humdinger of a summer/fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.43pm: Newt Gingrich spokesman </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">R.C. Hammond</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> turns on the media:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our traveling press corp. so close to the ocean, yet I can't push them in.instagr.am/p/Iha6S-xZl-/</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- R.C. Hammond (@rchammond) March 23, 2012</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.17pm:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Is President Obama a Muslim?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We posed the question earlier this week in a post about a poll that found (pdf) more Illinois Republicans (39%) say the president is a Muslim than say he is a Christian (24%). Poll respondents strongly motivated by ideology can give poll responses they don't really believe, Guardian forecaster Harry J Enten pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anonymous poll respondents are one thing. But what about presidential candidates?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newt Gingrich today said &quot;the way&quot; President Obama &quot;behaves&quot; makes people think he's Muslim. We assert that the president or any other politician's religion ought not be a matter for public mastication. May each person's soul take care of itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So anyway Newt Gingrich's current stump speech includes a line about how - well it is so wrong-headed in so many ways that it's tricky to paraphrase so we'll just quote him as Politico's Ginger Gibson does:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have said publicly several times that I believe Obama is a Christian. He went to a Christian church for over 20 years. He was listening to the sermons. The fact is I take him at his word but I think it is very bizarre that he is desperately concerned to apologize to Muslim religious fanatics while they are killing young Americans while at the same time going to war against the Catholic Church and against every right to live Protestant organization in the country. I just think it's a very strange value system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gingrich was asked today about the polls that show voters think Obama is a Muslim. Gingrich was asked whether rhetoric like the above might be just the kind of horseshine that contributes to the misconception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gingrich responded:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why does the president behave the way that people would think that? You have to ask why would they believe that? It's not cause they're stupid. It's because they watch the kind of things I just described to you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gingrich knows what he's doing here; he's working a political angle, digging into that wide area of suspicions some voters have about the president because they just do. Gingrich sees political gain in applying his knife to an area of the national spirit left raw from a decade of wars of words and of arms. So he does it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.13pm: Newt Gingrich press secretary </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">RC Hammond</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was our favorite presidential candidate spokesman for a hot minute today. Now he's out with this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flack doubles down on newt's obama/islam comments RT @rchammond: as long as the President gives peope reasons to doubt - they will doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Alex Burns (@aburnspolitico) March 23, 2012</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a political professional RC Hammond doubtless sees this kind of thing as rather innocent verbal swordplay. In the context of the daily three-ring circus that is a presidential campaign, it may well be. &quot;As long as President Obama gives people reason to doubt that he's a Christian, they'll doubt that he's a Christian&quot; - that's all he's saying. No harm, no foul, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in any context that is broader than this political race, RC Hammond's words flow into a churn of dark currents of national suspicion and historical pain. What the words do is apply pressure to prove one's religious membership with the majority and rejection of the minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, we're not saying RC Hammond is proposing that the president be required to prove that he is a Christian. Because how would you prove that anyway and wouldn't just bringing up the notion be so evocative of certain miserable historical moments that no thinking person - not to mention the representative of a man who has put himself forward as a national leader - would go there?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wait... no yes that's what RC Hammond is saying.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.29pm: OK let's talk about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">something else.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's a Huffington Post report on the Five Steamiest Passages in Arlen Specters's Memoir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specter's name has been bouncing around lately because Rick Santorum was very buddy-buddy with him when they were both Republican senators from Pennsylvania. That's bad because Specter switched to being a Democrat in 2009 because he realized he couldn't beat the Tea Party candidate that was ready to challenge him in the 2010 Republican GOP primary in PA. He lost anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friendships with and support for politicians who switch to the Democrats just does not fly with today's GOP. It's like there's some purity test with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1 on the list of the Five Steamiest Passages in Arlen Specters's Memoir is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ted Kennedy in the Hot Tub</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was in the whirlpool at the Senate gym in 2008, recovering from Hodgkin's, when Ted Kennedy came over and climbed into the bath. Kennedy was one of the Senate's giants, in many ways. It was as though a gigantic walrus had plunged into the sea, causing the level to swell. I'd never seen two men in the whirlpool before, but the tub was big enough for two or more. There was a sign that you had to shower before entering. I hadn't checked that out with Kennedy, but I had neither an objection nor compunction about his coming into the bath. We chatted.</SPAN></P>

How else to think of the week since the candidate got demolished in the Illinois primary? As pressure has mounted on him to get out of the race, Santorum's discourse has become increasingly grandiose and his off-the-cuff remarks increasingly prickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week Santorum started filling his speeches with overblown talk about the future of freedom and the American Revolution and the Civil War. On Thursday he recklessly equated a vote for Mitt Romney with a vote for President Obama. When asked about the line he scolded reporters for siding with Romney.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party establishment is calling on him to leave, and not too politely. Jeb Bush says it's time to unite behind Romney. Romney spokesman Ryan Williams labeled Santorum a #disgrace. Even a group whose support he might have thought he could count on, Tea Party founders FreedomWorks, got behind Romney. One can only imagine the pressure he's putting up with behind the scenes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Santorum knows what it's like to be unpopular. It's the position from which he has conducted his political career (although not his life: &quot;Rick was a funny guy. He sported a bushy moustache for a time, wore Hawaiian shirts and smoked cigars&quot;). For his unpopularity Santorum is loved and hated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Rick Santorum is planning a miniseries called &quot;Obamaville.&quot; Today his campaign released a teaser. It features a scene in which the heads of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad and American President Barack Obama flicker on a television screen, one replacing the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This video has been produced by a candidate who is most likely on the way off the national political stage. It's offensive. But take it on its own terms, as a campaign blow against Barack Obama. Is it effective? Didn't McCain-Palin try this kind of thing in 2008? It didn't work then.

The court is expected to rule on whether the provision of the law requiring Americans to carry health insurance is constitutional. It's a high-stakes hearing for the court and the president, not to mention the country. here's Chris:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a few things both sides agree on in the coming Supreme Court battle over Barack Obama's signature healthcare reforms. One of them is that it is likely to prove the most politically significant constitutional decision in years, and the outcome could shape the future of Obama's presidency. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court will hear a challenge by the attorneys general of 26 states and private business interests who argue that the healthcare law violates the constitution and tramples on individual freedoms by requiring almost all Americans to buy health insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an election looming and the public sharply divided on the healthcare reforms, the hearings are the most politically loaded since the court handed George Bush the presidential election over Al Gore in 2000.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last decade in the United States we have seen more natural disasters occur more frequently and intensely, due to climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steps need to be taken to prevent a catastrophe in our own back yards. It's interesting to me that newspapers will publish daily crime logs, but rarely do you see reports of emergency reactor shutdowns, which do occur, and/or the reasons for it. The public has a right to be informed on these matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Wikipedia, &quot;In 2010, Project Censored, a non-profit, investigative journalism project, ranked the safety issues at Shearon Harris the fourth most underreported story of the year, because of the risk of fires at what are the largest spent fuel pools in the country.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next time you see a police officer, or you have an opportunity to chat with your local politician, ask them what the nuclear reactor emergency plans are if we have an accident in our own backyard. I believe that question will be met by a blank stare.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and bias in prosecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tragic story of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death while walking black offers a vivid picture of how justice often works in this country. You might rightly question why the prisons are filled with black and Hispanic inmates to a degree far out of proportion to their criminality compared to Caucasian offenders. This story offers a peek into how that system works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one can argue that, if Martin had shot the white guy while claiming self defense, he would not have been immediately charged and jailed. The two major factors in play in this story are white fear of black folks and laws that make it easy and quite justified in a lot of people's minds to shoot someone if you &quot;feel threatened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Structured sentencing was designed to give judges little leeway in handing sentencing, in the hopes of taking bias out of the equation. Studies show that, statistically, minorities get the longest sentences allowed, while whites get the shortest. That begs the question as to who gets prosecuted. Prosecutors realize it is easier to get convictions of blacks and Hispanics due to built in jury biases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Tracy Cline, they often make up their minds as to guilt and ignore any contrary information. Prosecutors can hold poor people (mostly minorities) indefinitely by setting a bond so high they can't get out. They then offer a plea bargain to simply get out of jail. Only 5 percent of criminal charges are actually tried. Martin' death is a sad statement of that bias.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was proud to be a Durham Republican at our convention last Saturday when we debated the marriage amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ask yourself, has any other group actually asked its members to decide how they stand on this issue, other than Durham Republicans? We debated a resolution supporting the amendment and did not end debate until everyone in opposition had a chance to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We heard pro arguments based on popular sovereignty and on traditional values, and con argument based on minority rights and on libertarian values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't matter so much how the final vote came out (pro Amendment) as that Republicans honor the divide on this issue and are willing to hear different opinions. Do you see the opponents of the amendment willing to tolerate differing views?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So when you consider your vote on this amendment, remember that one side cherishes many voices while one side tries to use shaming tactics to suppress political differences. Who do you think best represents your values?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I rarely agree with columnist Leonard Pitts about anything, but he has a point with his column on the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the evidence indicates that he left his father's house to buy snacks. An overzealous neighborhood watch captain apparently followed him and started a confrontation which resulted in the young man's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have long advocated the right of citizens to keep and bear arms, even to use them in their defense. That will never change. Our founding fathers were wise to include the Second Amendment in the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However; the right to bear arms is not a license to stalk, harass or kill a person that is doing nothing wrong. Seemingly, the block captain was far too aggressive. The police had told him to stay in his vehicle but he followed him, got out and provoked a confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many of us would appreciate being followed as we walked home and were doing nothing wrong? Black kids wearing hoods are suspicious? Not hardly. Black and white kids with hoods walk by my house every day and have never bothered me.</SPAN></P>

For only the cost of a subscription, we are regularly offered the remarkable comedic stylings of John Hood and his Right-Wing Reactionary Tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His latest (March 18) article was priceless. In it, he offered yet another riotous defense of the indefensible supply-side economic model that has been widely credited with being a major cause of our current economic woes. Undeterred, Hood dove right back into the murky morass of that failed theory. His only misstep was to not accurately label his diatribe a whimsical send-up of what is popularly known as &quot;trickle-down&quot; economics. Such a mythology and sleight of hand didn't work 30 years ago when Hood's autocratic progenitors foisted that model upon the nation and it will not work today. But God love the man for rolling out one of the classic absurdist routines of our age yet again for the amusement of all in our community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it be the clever and incisive humor of Gary Trudeau or the much more simple-minded but nonetheless funny ramblings of John Hood, The Herald-Sun editorial page is always appreciated in our home.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. ? The police chief and prosecutor who have been bitterly criticized for not arresting a neighborhood watch volunteer in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager both left the case Thursday, with the chief saying that he is temporarily leaving his job to let passions cool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee's decision came less than a day after city commissioners gave him a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote, and after a couple of weeks of protests and uproar on social media websites. Lee has said evidence in the case supported George Zimmerman's claim that the Feb. 26 shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do this in the hopes of restoring some semblance of calm to a city which has been in turmoil for several weeks,&quot; Lee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About three hours later, Gov. Rick Scott announced that the local state attorney, Norman Wolfinger, had recused himself from the case. In a letter to Scott, Wolfinger said that while he thought he could fairly oversee any prosecution that develops in the case, his recusal was aimed at &quot;toning down the rhetoric and preserving the integrity of the investigation.&quot; Scott appointed Angela B. Corey, the state attorney for the Jacksonville area, to take over the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott also appointed a task force led by Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll to conduct hearings on the case and to make recommendations for any changes to state law or procedures. Carroll is African-American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was returning from a trip to a convenience store when Zimmerman started following him, telling police dispatchers he looked suspicious. At some point, the two got into a fight and Zimmerman pulled out his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told police Martin attacked him after he had given up on chasing the teenager and was returning to his sport utility vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting ignited resentment toward the police department in this Orlando suburb for not making an arrest. Civil rights groups have held rallies in Florida and New York, saying the shooting was unjustified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief continued Thursday to stand behind his agency's investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a former homicide investigator, a career law enforcement officer and a father, I am keenly aware of the emotions associated with this tragic death of a child. I'm also aware that my role as a leader of this agency has become a distraction from the investigation,&quot; Lee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't immediately how long the police chief would step aside. Martin's parents said that wasn't enough, and that Zimmerman should be taken into custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want an arrest, we want a conviction and we want him sentenced for the murder of my son,&quot; Martin's father, Tracy, said to fiery crowd of about 1,000 supporters in downtown Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people believed the police chief should step down for good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they wanted to defuse a potential powder keg, he needed to resign,&quot; said pastor Eugene Walton, 58, who was born and raised in Sanford. &quot;His inaction speaks loudly to the black community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of the police chief's decision to step aside spread quickly among the protesters, many of whom showed up more than two hours before the start of the rally. They chanted &quot;The chief is gone. Zimmerman is next.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some carried signs that said: &quot;100 years of lynching, justifiable homicide. Same thing.&quot; Others sold T-shirts that read: &quot;Arrest Zimmerman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the norm around here, where anything involving black culture, they want to wipe their hands of it,&quot; said Shella Moore, who is black and grew up in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department and FBI have opened a civil rights investigation, and the local prosecutor has convened a grand jury April 10 to determine whether to charge Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the rally, Martin's parents met with the local U.S. attorney, the deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights in Washington and the head of the FBI's Tampa office to discuss the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We listened carefully to the concerns of the family and their representatives,&quot; Special Agent Dave Couvertier, an FBI spokesman, said in a statement. &quot;We continue to extend our deepest condolences to Trayvon's family for their loss.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">890 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the advice that he who is without sin should not be the first to cast the stone, we have for a very long time seen some members of the international community in the forefront of attacking Zimbabwe's security and judicial systems, labelling them as partisan. This means that they have passed a no-confidence vote on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since these are systems that we use and rely on everyday, when they face such criticism, especially from foreign nations, it is interesting to see how these nations' own systems operate, and draw parallels. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On both sides of the Atlantic, the world has witnessed two killings which have been dealt with very differently, despite the fact that both parties would want to look at the Zimbabwean situation from a similar point of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 26, a 17-year old black boy was shot dead by a member of the neighbourhood watch committee in Florida in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The guard claimed that he shot the teenage boy in self-defence, although there are strong indications that the boy was not armed. The US media in particular has not taken the case very seriously, making us wonder whether they would have reported it differently if a black man had shot dead an un-armed white teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a number of issues and lessons to be drawn from the case, racism being the major one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The February 26 incident, occurring during the month when people in the US celebrate Black History Month has made the world question what it means to have a superpower electing its first black president, and the ordinary black person continuing to be an object of ridicule and racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes the case also very interesting is that the perpetrator who was initially fingered as white, but is in fact a Hispanic has not been arrested, and the police are now intending to carry out investigations just because some people have voiced their concerns at the callous murder of an innocent civilian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is the US police force protecting the perpetrator, and why is President Barack Obama silent on the issue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he is national president, Africa in some cases would want him to realise that he is first of all a black man, who lives in a world that has tagged black men as criminals, drug addicts and, living on social welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, President Obama represents and protects a variety of interests, but the murder of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is one of those interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why should issues about people of colour be issues after people have protested? Why did the law not take its course then?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also ask the same questions to the US Ambassador to Zimbabwe who is not only a black man, but also knows the racial challenges that African-Americans face in their own country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No amount of glossing will remove those problems. President Obama in particular cannot afford to be colour-blind just because he wants to play the &quot;Mr Nice Guy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the days of slavery up to the time when the likes of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr stood up against a system that had oppressed black people for more that three hundred years, the whole notion in the civil rights movement was not to have people compromising themselves against the very issues they struggled for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The objective was to see the African-American man and woman standing their ground, and on par with people of other races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rodney King saga in the early nineties should have been one major lesson. However, when there is a system that makes it is easy to accuse black people of every misdemeanour, it becomes a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are too many cases to recount, just as the many black men in US prisons and some on drugs. We thus ask President Obama not to be so colour-blind, but instead to be his own brothers' keepers, for he knows what it means to be black in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African-American community in less than two years lost two of their most talented artists -- Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One minute they lived in that bubble-land as millionaires, and the next minute they were either broke and/or depending on drugs which also killed them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This should not have happened, especially after the US elected its first black president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, president Obama, when the celebrated Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr was treated as a common thief by a white police officer while trying to enter his own home, you were angry, but later just swept that racism under the carpet and pacified the aggrieved parties at a &quot;beer summit&quot; at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family and other black people the world over are keen to know how you will deal with this case, for, you have been quick to condemn and judge other people's systems not knowing that there is as much muck in your own backyard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have to make the contrasts although it hurts us. When a gunman killed some Jewish children and their rabbi in France, French president Nicholas Sarkozy was quick to respond and was with them through and through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He even called for a minute of silence to remember the slain children. So too, the French police!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We ask president Obama why he seems to distance himself when ordinary black people in his country would want to see him taking action, the sort of action he takes when dealing with governments that are not in his favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change that African-Americans want is that when one of their own is in a position of authority, he or she will stand up for their cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, anyone with a public platform agrees, is a tragedy. The 17-year-old boy from Sanford, Florida was shot and killed by George Zimmerman on February 21, after Zimmerman called the police to report a suspicious looking figure wearing a hoodie. He felt threatened, and under Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, he had the right to defend himself against an aggressor. Martin, it would turn out, was armed with just an iced tea and a bag of Skittles he had bought for his little brother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has yet to be arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story -- and outrage -- has exploded this month, as more details have come out about Zimmerman's history of false-panic 911 complaints and an alleged racial slur made duringthe fateful Martin-related call. Using its clout and megaphone, Hollywood has become a player in creating the sort of public awareness required to keep the case in the spotlight and move it forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks ago, the Stop Kony video was tweeted out by dozens of stars, urging fans to watch an in-question documentary about a warlord in Africa. Now, there is more urgency in their social media messages, as they push for justice, circulating a petition on Change.org that has reached 1.4 million signatures and using the Twitter hashtag #Justice4Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spike Lee has been at the forefront of the movement, tweeting messages such as&quot;America The Beautiful,A Country Where A Black Teenager Can Be Shot And Killed Coming From A 7-Eleven Buying A Ice Tea And A Bag Of Skittles,&quot; and retweeting -- often with commentary -- messages from fans and other advocates for legal action against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee, along with The Roots drummer Questlove, supported the Million Hoodie March earlier in the week, in which advocates for Zimmerman's arrest walked uptown in New York City, clad in hooded sweatshirts and calling for an arrest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other celebrities have also weighed in on the matter, as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will celebrity activism work? It's hard to isolate the impact, as they have blended in with plenty of pressure from many groups, from civil rights organizations to political leaders to other media commentators. CNN's Piers Morgan has tweeted anger about it and Anderson Cooper has provided extensive coverage, while MSNBC's Ed Schultz and Rachel Maddow have pushed against the law,the Sanford Police Chief and even George W. Bush, bringing nightly focus to the case. Then, of course, was Geraldo Rivera's comments, in which he said Zimmerman should be prosecuted, but Martin made himself a target by wearing a hoodie. Rivera earned a strong rebuke for the remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus far, things are moving, if somewhat slowly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calls for a re-examining of the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law have led to the state's governor, Rick Scott, to ask the State Senate to look at the code. The Justice Department is looking into it. The Sanford Police Chief, Bill Lee, has temporarily stepped down. President Obama has called an investigation imperative, and said on Fridaythat &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida and the failure of the police to arrest the shooter, who claimed self-defense, is a cautionary tale about those states, including Pennsylvania, that have expanded the right to use lethal force in self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Feb. 26, Martin was shot and killed in Sanford, Fla. Martin, who is black, had been visiting his father in a gated community. He left the townhouse to get a snack at a local convenience store. Martin was seen by George Zimmerman, a Neighborhood Watch captain, when he was returning from the store. Zimmerman called 911 to report a &quot;suspicious&quot; person. The dispatcher told Zimmerman to stop following Martin and that a police car would be dispatched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police arrived, Zimmerman was outside his car with a bloody nose. The &quot;suspicous&quot; 17-year-old was dead. Zimmerman said he shot the boy in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, has not been charged because of a Florida law, known as the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, that was expanded in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the law's passage, a person confronted with lethal force had a duty to attempt to retreat. &quot;Retreat&quot; was largely regarded as any attempt, including shouting a warning, to elude an attack. It should be noted that genuine self-defense - in any situation - is, and always has been, legal. An expansion of the statute was unnecessary but lawmakers were unwilling to oppose legislation sponsored by the National Rifle Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The retreat provision was removed. A person who is now confronted with deadly force or the perception of deadly force need not retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that sounds familiar, it should. Pennsylvania's Castle Doctrine law was expanded last year. It, too, removed the duty of someone who feels threatened in their home to retreat. It expanded the right of citizens to use deadly force outside their homes, in their vehicles, at their place of business or any other place they have a right to be if they believe the other person threatens them with deadly force or what they perceive to be deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But given the stress of the moment and the fact that many of these situations occur at night or in dimly lit conditions, reaching for one's keys could easily be construed as reaching for a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement and prosecutors do not like the change in the law because they must prove that a shooting was not self-defense. That changes the entire nature of the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Florida legislature was considering expanding the law in 2005, critics warned that it would create a vigilante state in which people would shoot first and claim self-defense after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's exactly what's happening. The number of justifiable homicides in Florida has tripled since the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law was passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the Martin shooting, Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, has agreed that it may be time to take another look at the Florida law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 23--DALLAS -- ege is a historically black college in southeast Dallas. After the school president sent out a tweet inviting protesters to join a rally, the college became the site of a demonstration for more than 300 protesters Friday evening. They came out to demand the shooter who killed Florida teen, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, be charged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Quinn president Michael Sorrell said, &quot;We want to ask them to examine the laws. Let's change the legislation not just in Florida, but any state that has rules to allow Vigilantism to occur and the people who perpetrated the crime to go unchecked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school's student body president, Dexter Evans also chimed in saying, &quot;It's intimidating. I'm really shocked, and I'm really upset by it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school and sponsors handed out cases of Skittles candies. Many in attendance came armed with their own, packing signs to express their feelings. Roshandaline Rhodes says she fears for her son in light of Trayvon's death. Rhodes shared, &quot;That's my one and only son, 19 years-old. So I just envisioned my son could have been that little boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Williams, who has two young sons, says of the demonstration, &quot;This could actually be my child one day. When it happens to an adult it's one thing. When it starts happening to children, that's a whole different issue. My children asked, they want to know why are people so mean. I couldn't answer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several speakers took to the podium, such as Texas State Senator Royce West (D) from the 23rd District who vowed to introduce a bill to have the gun of a person who uses deadly force, be taken while an investigation is underway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several protesters say they came out to show support for the dead teen's family, in hopes that the same tragedy does not fall on another life. Jonathan Patton and his friends sentiments are the same. Patton said, &quot;We're performing cop watches, keeping and eye on police officers to make sure they're not violating the rights of citizens. And we're going around passing out fliers, letting people know where they can get educated on their rights, and educated on the system around them. The kid was shot for having a pack of skittles and wearing a hoodie. So we're here wearing our hoodies. It's not a crime to wear a hoodie and everyone's carrying packages of skittles around. You can't shoot someone because they have something in their hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the rally, demonstrators marched around the campus demanding that Sanford, Florida Police Chief Bill Lee, temporarily stepped down amid criticism and demand for his resignation. The FBI and Justice Department are investigatIng the case. Next month, a grand jury will be convened if decide if the shooter, 28 year old George Zimmerman, should be charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students at the University of Texas Arlington are also planning a similar demonstration for Monday morning at 11:00 on the UTA campus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No arrests have been made following the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in a Sanford suburb on February 26. Protesters held placards with pictures of shooter George Zimmerman alongside slogans such as &quot;arrest and indict this SOB now&quot; and &quot;Fake cop.&quot; Others read: &quot;100 years of lynching, justifiable homicide.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Same thing&quot; and &quot;Pray, protest, but get armed.&quot; Mr Zimmerman insists that he had acted in self-defence. Veteran civil rights activists Al Sharpton told the rally: &quot;We want permanent justice - we want Zimmerman in court with his hands cuffed behind his back.&quot; Hundreds of US citizens took to popular social media sites Facebook and Twitter in hooded sweatshirts on Thursday in solidarity with the Martin family. People changed their profile pictures and tweeted photos of themselves wearing hoodies, many posing the question: &quot;Do I look suspicious?&quot; or using the Twitter hashtag &quot;IAmTrayvonMartin.&quot; Former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm and Children's Defence Fund head Marian Wright Edelman joined the grouping, which included everyone from grandmothers to a group of law students from Howard University. Ms Granholm said: &quot;The hoodie is a way of expressing support for the Martin family, and for all the sons of African-American families who bear the heavy burden of other people's negative assumptions.&quot; Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, who has been lambasted for not arresting Mr Zimmerman, announced that he was temporarily stepping down on Thursday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no question that ''Mad Men'' would get around to the civil rights movement. From the start, racism was the carbon monoxide of the show: a poison that couldn't always be detected over the pungent scent of cigarettes, sexism, anti-Semitism, alcoholism, homophobia and adultery, but that sooner or later was bound to turn noxious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That promise was made in the opening scene of the premiere episode of Season 1. The first face on screen is a black one in profile, that of a waiter carrying a tray of cocktails across a bar crowded with white, mostly male customers. The camera closes in on Don Draper (Jon Hamm), scribbling ideas on a napkin for a Lucky Strike campaign. Asking for a light, he notices that the busboy, an older black man, smokes Old Gold, and Don asks him why he is so loyal to that brand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Is Sam here bothering you?'' a white bartender interjects before the busboy has uttered a word. Shooting the black man a warning look, the bartender tells Don, ''He can be a little chatty.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the dawn of the 1960s, and that kind of humiliation was so commonplace that both Don and the busboy shrug it off. ''Mad Men'' returns to AMC for a fifth season on Sunday, and times have changed -- again. African-Americans are now picketing on the street, chanting for fair employment and equal opportunity. It's a tinderbox summer of riots and protests, and the reception from some who are working on Madison Avenue is less than supportive. Advertising may be a cool profession that draws talented, sophisticated people, but even some of them can be bigots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mad Men'' distinguished itself by depicting not just the fashion of the 1960s but also the attitudes that are now so unfashionable. The show's creator, Matthew Weiner, found a sly, satirical way to revive the crudest forms of sexism and prejudice that were typical then but are nowadays carefully airbrushed out of television. Old attitudes about race in particular are so distasteful that it's become almost taboo to show them, even in the past tense. So most shows refract unsavory times through a contemporary lens, often bending reality to showcase a main character's ahistoric decency and open-mindedness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That effort was at times so contrived that it turned more offensive than the truth. (''Little House on the Prairie'' is a classic example of twisted storytelling: the writers of that hit show, which ran from 1974 to 1983, left out Dr. George A. Tann, a real African-American doctor who treated Laura and her family for malaria, and instead invented Solomon, a son of a former slave who seeks refuge and an education from the kind-hearted Ingalls.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even ''Mad Men'' knockoffs lack the nerve to depict racism as it really was. ''The Playboy Club,'' a short-lived NBC drama set in Chicago in the 1960s, made sure that the sole black bunny was treated by the heroine with dignity and deference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On ''Mad Men,'' even the good guys have bad attitudes. Roger Sterling (John Slattery), who sang ''My Old Kentucky Home'' in blackface at a Derby Day party, isn't opposed to civil rights, he's just reflexively racist. In Season 4, Roger angles to set up the newly single Don with a friend of his wife's over Thanksgiving. Don asks Roger, ''What do you need?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger replies lightly, ''Someone white to carve our turkey.'' It's a casual joke but one that resounds a little later, when Don is on a date with the young woman, and she mentions the deaths of Andrew Goodman and two other civil rights workers in Mississippi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Is that what it takes to change things?'' she asks sorrowfully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don is more taken with her dress than with her idealism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the show's willingness to put its characters in the context of the times, and not whitewash the white men, that gives it an edge and keeps a drama that in its fifth season has gotten -- let's face it -- a little old and soapy, interesting to watch. Particularly at this moment, when the case of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager killed by an armed neighborhood watch volunteer, has become a heated cause, the 1960s look a lot like prologue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don and his colleagues are flip, self-centered and oblivious, no different from the many privileged Americans who stood on the sidelines and averted their eyes. They are the ones who ended up on the wrong side of history and whose testimony is usually left out of the textbooks, like the bourgeois Parisians who collaborated -- faute de mieux -- during the Nazi occupation, the South Africans who welcomed cheap labor under apartheid or the cadets who set fire to the clothes of the first female cadets admitted to the Citadel military college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is perhaps one reason that it's hard to care quite as much about the fates of frustrated ad executives, put-upon secretaries and unfulfilled wives. But it's not the only one. The two-hour premiere feels long and is a little dreary, repeating many of the same themes that were so new and unexpected when the series first began. Certain genres have inherent limits, and just as there are only so many ways zombies can storm a stalled car on ''The Walking Dead,'' there are only so many jokes to be had from an adult's cradling an infant in one hand and a cigarette in the other on ''Mad Men.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The downside of success is too much devotion. ''Mad Men'' fatigue is brought on by all the fuss and cute imitation: the Banana Republic fashion line; copycat shows like ''Pan Am'' and ''Magic City,'' a new Starz series set in 1960s Miami; '60s memoirs, coffee table books, cookbooks, cocktail recipes and magazine spreads; ''Mad Men'' costume parties; and ''Mad Men'' drinking tours of Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not fair, really, but a show that became a hit because it seemed so original has been so co-opted that it now looks like a cliche.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventeen months have passed since last season's finale, and other shows have come along that are set in a present that suddenly seems fresh and unexplored, like ''Homeland'' on Showtime and ''Girls,'' which begins on HBO in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The personalities on ''Mad Men'' don't change, but the times do. At this point, the context may be more interesting than the characters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- Last August, Wendy Dorival got a call about setting up a local neighborhood watch. As the volunteer coordinator for the Police Department here, she gets such calls regularly, and the city already had at least 10 active watch groups. So she thought nothing of this call, from George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She set up a visit for the next month at the Retreat at Twin Lakes, a gated community that had been dealing with a string of burglaries. When 25 residents showed up, a decent turnout, she had the residents introduce themselves; after all, people join the groups to look out for each other. She then gave a PowerPoint presentation and distributed a handbook. As she always does, she emphasized what a neighborhood watch is -- and what it is not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In every presentation, ''I go through what the rules and responsibilities are,'' she said Thursday. The volunteers' role, she said, is ''being the eyes and ears'' for the police, ''not the vigilante.'' Members of a neighborhood watch ''are not supposed to confront anyone,'' she said. ''We get paid to get into harm's way. You don't do that. You just call them from the safety of your home or your vehicle.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using a gun in the neighborhood watch role would be out of the question, she said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman was there, she recalled, and the local group appointed him their coordinator. But on Feb. 26, Mr. Zimmerman, 28, pursued, confronted and fatally shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, an unarmed black high school student who had been carrying only an iced tea and a bag of Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the weeks since, public reaction has gone from a simmer to a full boil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, has been interviewed by the police, but officials decided not to charge him in the shooting, citing his assertion of self-defense under a lenient Florida law known as Stand Your Ground. He was licensed to carry a concealed weapon. He has said nothing publicly about the case in the face of the growing community anger and rallies calling for his prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the city's police chief, Bill Lee, announced that he would temporarily step aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''While I stand by the Sanford Police Department, its personnel and the investigation that was conducted in regards to the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case,'' he said at a news conference, ''it is apparent that my involvement in this matter is overshadowing the process.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day before, the City Commission passed a vote of no confidence in the chief by three votes to two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the state announced that a grand jury would be empanelled next month to review the case, and the civil rights division of the Department of Justice said it would open an investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday evening, Gov. Rick Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi of Florida announced that the state attorney who had been handling the case, Norman R. Wolfinger, was stepping aside ''to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest or impropriety,'' and that the state attorney from Jacksonville, Angela B. Corey, would take over the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on Thursday evening, a boisterous rally led by the Rev. Al Sharpton took place at a lakefront park in Sanford. People -- some arriving by bus from Atlanta, others having flown in from around the country -- wore homemade T-shirts reading ''I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,'' and carried posters with his image; others had posters with Mr. Zimmerman's picture and calls for his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many carried bottles of Arizona Iced Tea and wore makeshift necklaces with a box of Skittles around their necks. Mr. Sharpton introduced Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, who told the crowd, ''Trayvon is your son.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Ms. Dorival, the widening controversy has led to a false impression about neighborhood watch programs, which she said strengthen local communities and help reduce crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I believe in neighborhood watch,'' she said. ''I advocate for neighborhood watch. I don't want this black eye for neighborhood watch.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sanford, she said, watch groups are not even supposed to make the rounds. That is the job of another kind of volunteer organization, Citizens on Patrol, whose members are selected and trained by the police and who drive the streets in a specially marked vehicle. Members of that group, Ms. Dorival said, ''are armed only with a radio.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A wide range of neighborhood watch organizations exist across the country. Some have patrols, while others like Sanford's do not. But the National Sheriffs' Association, which sponsors the program nationwide, is absolutely clear on one point: guns have no place in a watch group. A manual distributed by the association repeatedly underscores the point: ''Patrol members do not carry weapons.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manual warns that watch members should ''not attempt to apprehend a person committing a crime or to investigate a suspicious activity.'' It should be emphasized to members of patrols, the materials state, that ''they do not possess police power and they shall not carry weapons.'' The consequences of not following the guidelines are severe, the manual states: ''Each member is liable as an individual for civil and criminal charges should he exceed his authority.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighborhood watch movement came together some 40 years ago through the efforts of the National Sheriffs' Association. Chris Tutko, the national director for the program at the association, said there were 25,000 registered neighborhood watch groups in the United States today, and far more unregistered groups like the one in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is a common-sense organization,'' Mr. Tutko said. ''If you carry a weapon, most likely you're going to turn into a victim, or worse.'' In his 40 years of work in law enforcement, he said, he has not seen another case like the one involving Mr. Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potentially troublesome people do sometimes join, he said. Occasionally ''an aggressive person'' will show up, he said, but ''usually the neighborhood watch calms that person down, or gets rid of them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But criminal justice experts say there is risk of a would-be Harry Callahan, the ''Dirty Harry'' character played by Clint Eastwood. And the spread of laws allowing ready access to legal firearms can put guns into the wrong hands, said James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University in Boston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I trust most people who carry concealed weapons, but not all of them,'' Professor Fox said. ''Lots of people walk around with firearms concealed in their clothing who have paranoid ideas concealed in their head.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the Florida law that Mr. Zimmerman has apparently cited in his defense allows people to use deadly force against assailants, Kent Scheidegger, the legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in California, said that the law's protections are diminished if the person using deadly force initiates the confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If it wasn't really self-defense, then Stand Your Ground doesn't come into play,'' Mr. Scheidegger said. But, he added, it is hard to judge the situation before trial, ''because you don't know what really happened.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting in Sanford has left Ms. Dorival, the police department's volunteer coordinator, shaken. She has received e-mails ''with a lot of curse words,'' she said, and some that accuse her of having caused the problem, writing that ''I taught this guy to shoot a gun.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You cannot control people's actions,'' Ms. Dorival said. ''I do my best to lay the groundwork,'' for conducting a safe and successful neighborhood watch program, ''and tell them what they can and cannot do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added, ''Obviously, he didn't follow the basic philosophy of the neighborhood watch.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALBANY -- Black and Latino lawmakers, fed up over the frequency with which New York City police officers are stopping and frisking minority men, are battling what they say is a racial divide as they push legislation to rein in the practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The divide, they say, is largely informed by personal experience: many who object to the practice say that they have themselves been stopped by the police for reasons they believe were related to race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Kevin S. Parker, a Brooklyn Democrat, recalled several occasions when, as a high school student walking home in Flatbush, he was stopped by the police, patted down, told to empty his pockets, produce identification and divulge his destination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assemblyman Karim Camara, a Democrat from Brooklyn, remembers greeting a woman who was walking down a street in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, when, he said, officers in plain clothes approached him and demanded to know who he was, where he was going and whether he had any guns or drugs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when Senator Adriano Espaillat, a Manhattan Democrat, was just 14, he said, detectives threw him against a wall and patted him down in Washington Heights, in Manhattan, when he was on his way to buy a Dominican newspaper for his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmakers say the racial imbalance with which stop-and-frisk is applied has a corollary effect: Many white legislators have remained silent on the issue, or have supported the police, revealing a racial gap over attitudes toward the practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is an ethnic divide on who's being stopped and frisked, and there is an ethnic divide on who's fighting against the policy,'' said State Senator Eric L. Adams, a Democrat and a retired police captain from Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmakers' effort to set off a debate in Albany is taking place with an increased focus on the interplay between race and public safety. It was highlighted in New York by the fatal shooting last month of Ramarley Graham, 18, by a police officer in the Bronx, and nationally by the fatal shooting last month of Trayvon Martin, 17, by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida. The young men were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Both illustrate the perils of racial stereotyping when individuals are empowered with the capacity to make life and death decisions,'' said Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat. He said the shootings had ''further emboldened legislators to continue to fight to deal with the out-of-control stop-and-frisk practices.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The split among Albany lawmakers over the stop-and-frisk issue reflects a divide among New York City voters: according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on March 13, 59 percent of white voters approve of it, and 27 percent of black voters do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, facing increased complaints about the practice, has pushed back hard against critics. Last week, assailed by the City Council over the practice, Mr. Kelly said that the policy was an important policing tool intended to reduce the violence that has victimized blacks and Hispanics, and that, ''What I haven't heard is any solution to the violence problems in these communities.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''People are upset about being stopped,'' he continued, ''yet what is the answer?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Police Department, 96 percent of shooting victims last year, and 90 percent of murder victims, were minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's more police assigned to a place like East New York than, say, a precinct in Riverdale,'' said the Police Department spokesman, Paul J. Browne, ''so the police are going to be in a position to observe suspicious behavior more frequently.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Police Department has said that it conducted a record 684,330 stops last year, and that 87 percent of those stopped were black or Hispanic. About 10 percent of the stops led to arrests or summonses and 1 percent to the recovery of a weapon, according to the Center for Constitutional Rights, which has examined police data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Police Department frames the numbers in a different way: last year, it said, it recovered 8,000 weapons, 800 of them handguns, via stops. And over the last decade, the number of murders has dropped by 51 percent, ''in part because of stop, question and frisk,'' Mr. Browne said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some white elected officials have strongly criticized the stop-and-frisk policy. They included the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, and the public advocate, Bill de Blasio, both of whom are likely candidates for mayor; and Brad Lander and Daniel Dromm, who are on the Council. Senator Michael Gianaris, a Democrat from Queens, has offered a bill that would make it illegal for the department to set a quota for the number of stops officers must make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Stringer said it was important for elected officials ''who look like me'' to help broaden the coalition of New Yorkers fighting against stop-and-frisk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But race continues to dominate discussion of the issue. Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, a black Democrat from Harlem, is still smarting over a legislative debate he had in 2008 with Assemblyman David R. Townsend Jr., a white Republican from central New York, on a proposal to prohibit racial profiling. Mr. Townsend said part of good police work involved questioning people who seemed out of place in a particular neighborhood, regardless of their race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If you were spotted in an affluent section of Oneida County where we don't have minority people living, and you were driving around through these houses, and I was a law enforcement officer and a highway patrol, I would stop you to say, No. 1: 'Are you lost? Is there something we can help you with, or what are you doing here?' '' Mr. Townsend said to Mr. Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, the Legislature passed a law requiring police officials in New York City to no longer store the names and addresses of people stopped but not charged. Gov. David A. Paterson, the state's first African-American governor, signed the measure despite objections not only from city officials, but also, he said, from an all-white panel advising him on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent interview, Mr. Paterson, a Democrat, said his views of the measure were informed by his own experience, which included being stopped three times by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's a feeling of being degraded,'' he said. ''I think that's what people who it hasn't happened to don't understand.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Mr. Jeffries is sponsoring a bill that would make it a violation, not a crime, to possess small quantities of marijuana in public view. The bill, he said, would curb the tens of thousands of arrests each year that result when officers stop people and ask them to empty their pockets, leading to the revelation of small amounts of marijuana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wright has been urging passage of a bill that would prohibit police officers from stopping people based solely on their race or ethnicity. Mr. Parker is behind legislation to create the post of inspector general for the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in the Council, Jumaane D. Williams has introduced bills that would require officers to inform people they stop that they can refuse to be searched and make mandatory and citywide a pilot program in which officers give those stopped a business card with a phone number, in case they want to lodge a complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Williams has had his own run-ins with police. He said he was stopped in Brooklyn last year, after he had bought a BMW, by officers who said, ''We want to make sure it's yours.'' And, in an episode that drew widespread publicity, he was detained by the police last year after an argument with officers over whether he was allowed to use a closed sidewalk during the West Indian American Day Parade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We know that the legislation is not going to stop stop-and-frisk,'' he said. ''What we're trying to do is provide more accountability with the N.Y.P.D. and their practices and policies.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The famous and the unsung took to Facebook and Twitter in hooded sweatshirts on Thursday in solidarity with the family of a black teenager shot to death by a Hispanic neighbourhood watch captain in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spontaneous social media effort by dozens came a day after a few hundred people joined the Million Hoodie March on Wednesday night to protest the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They changed their profile pictures and tweeted photos of themselves wearing hoodies, many also posing the question: &quot;Do I look suspicious?&quot; or using the Twitter hashtag &quot;IAmTrayvonMartin&quot; in a show of frustration and outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm and Marian Wright Edelman, who heads the Children&quot;s defence Fund, joined the fray, which included everyone from grandmothers to a group of law students from Howard University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wanted to stand with all the young people who are standing up for justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Edelman said in a statement. &quot;I wanted to protest that Walking While Black and wearing a hoodie should lead to a death sentence in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No arrests have been made in the case, angering Trayvon&quot;s mother, Tracy Martin, and the family&quot;s supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 commenters on Facebook cheered the photo posted by Granholm, host of &quot;The War Room&quot; on the progressive cable network Current TV. She served two terms as governor before term limits ended her administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hoodie is a way of expressing support for the Martin family, and for all the sons of African American families who bear the heavy burden of other people&quot;s negative assumptions,&quot; Granholm said in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon died Feb. 26. He was returning to the home of his father&quot;s fiancee in a gated community in the city after buying candy at a convenience store. He was unarmed and was wearing a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighbourhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, has not been charged in the shooting. Zimmerman has said the teen attacked him and he shot him in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, who has been excoriated for not arresting Zimmerman, temporarily stepped down Thursday, saying he had become a distraction to the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adrienne Garrett, 37, a family and community involvement coordinator for a middle school in Florida, said she tweeted herself with dark hood up and bangs peeking out to support Trayvon&quot;s mother and family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel for her,&quot; Garrett said. &quot;Being in the school system and seeing these young boys, it&quot;s hard for them to go out and be safe without being profiled. It&quot;s just frustrating, and it&quot;s been going on for years and years.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Florida's Stand Your Ground Law was debated in 2005, opponents called it The Wild West Bill, the Shoot Your Neighbor Bill and the Street Shooter Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody called it the Shoot Kids Walking Around Your Neighborhood Bill. That would have been alarmist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe not, it turns out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts of Trayvon Martin's death are by now familiar. George Zimmerman, 28, neighborhood watch group captain, was cruising Twin Lakes, a gated Sanford subdivision, on Feb. 26, armed with a 9mm handgun, when he spotted 17-year-old Martin, whom he deemed Very Suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mind you, Zimmerman was not a policeman. He was not a security guard. He was not even associated with a formal Neighborhood Watch Program-affiliated group. He appears to have been a wannabe cop with too much time on his hands who had called the police 46 times in the past 14 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something. It's raining and he's just walking around, looking about,&quot; Zimmerman told police as he spotted Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A black youth both walking and looking at where he's walking. This is stated as though it's obviously worrisome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Martin was merely walking home after buying Skittles and ice tea at a convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within minutes of the call, Zimmerman had shot Martin dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was not arrested. He was not charged with a crime. Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee even appeared to place some blame on the unarmed youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't have anything to dispute his claim of self-defense,&quot; Lee said of Zimmerman at a press conference. He cited chapter and verse of Florida's Stand Your Ground Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, there you have it: A vigilante shoots an unarmed kid and after questioning goes home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stood his ground. Move along, folks, nothing to see here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case has gained national notoriety because of its racially explosive nature. People can shoot black kids for walking around and then just go home? Is that the kind of place we live?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this is no anomaly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Stand Your Ground Law, any cop-in-his-own-mind, bully, hothead, edgy racist, muddled paranoid, road-rager, gang enforcer and mean drunk can reach for a get-of-jail-free card as soon as he sticks his gun back in his waistband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An exaggeration? Hardly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider Paul Miller of Flagler Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told police last week he shot his neighbor during an argument over a barking dog. He said he felt threatened by the unarmed man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighbor was found on his side of the lot line with five bullet wounds to his neck, chest and abdomen. Witnesses used adjectives like &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;methodical&quot; to describe the shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miller, too, was questioned and released. He said he was standing his ground. Only later would he be charged with second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think about that: We live in a place where police need a day or so to figure out if blowing away a neighbor for yelling at you might be a chargeable offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Add the volatile chemical of race to these kinds of charged face- offs and it seems remarkable that a case rousing the passions of the Martin shooting hadn't happened already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then it's the nature of tragedy for bad things to seem destined to happen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD -- They came from nearby neighborhoods as well as Orlando and Daytona Beach. They came from DeBary, DeLand and New Smyrna Beach. And New York and California, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of people gathered at Fort Mellon Park on the south shore of Lake Monroe, less than three miles from the site of 17- year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's fatal shooting on Feb. 26. They chanted for justice. They waved signs and cheered when civil-rights activists, such as the Rev. Al Sharpton, Benjamin Jealous and Dick Gregory, as well as Martin's parents, called for an arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call has gone out across the country,&quot; said the Rev. L. Ronald Durham, pastor of Greater Friendship Baptist Church in Daytona Beach and one of the rally's organizers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And many of those who answered the call pointed to what they believe was an injustice -- the death of a boy carrying a can of iced tea and a bag of Skittles candy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could have been my child,&quot; said Reggie Sandilands, the New Smyrna Beach father of a 22-year-old Bethune-Cookman University student. &quot;This goes on every day, all over the place, not just in Sanford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By &quot;this,&quot; he was referring to young black men being viewed as suspicious, something dangerous, something they're not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he is convinced race played a role in the way the Sanford police handled the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch captain who has been described as both white and Hispanic, told police he shot Martin in self defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had it been a black man that shot a white kid, he would have been locked up immediately,&quot; Sandilands said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marie Rudd of DeBary came to the rally with her husband and granddaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several years earlier, when she lived in Sanford, she got to know Martin, who played piano with her niece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was such a loving young man,&quot; Rudd said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was just very friendly. Everyone adored him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She heard about his death on the television news the day after the shooting and is outraged an arrest hasn't been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I truly hope that justice prevails and Zimmerman gets what he deserves,&quot; Rudd said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He killed the child,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kinds of assumptions she believes Zimmerman made about Martin -- that he was a dangerous criminal because he was young, black, unfamiliar and wearing a hooded sweatshirt, are all too common, Rudd said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could be my child or your child,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan DuPree of DeLand and her friend Martha Bryant-Hall of Maitland -- veterans of decades of civil rights marches -- commiserated about having to come together once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've done this before,&quot; said DuPree, who was wearing an Occupy DeLand button.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another friend, Christe Ashley of DeLand, said the Occupy movement and those supporting Martin's family in calling for Zimmerman's arrest have one basic commonality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're all human beings,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where there is injustice, we need to stand up against it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. John Long, senior pastor at Tubman-King Community Church in Daytona Beach, arrived at the rally and felt a wave of emotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a mixture. It's sadness at the reason why we're gathered. There's also great pride to see so many expressing a spirit of unity and peace,&quot; said Long, who was among the speakers addressing the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long and others, including Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents -- Tracy Martin and Sabrina Fulton -- reacted to one of Thursday's developments, the announcement that Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee will step down temporarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's long overdue,&quot; Long said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fulton thanked God for the gathering before commenting on Lee's status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's temporary relief but we need a permanent relief,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need an arrest today.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin is an illustration of how dangerous badly drafted laws can be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of the unarmed 17 year old, shot by a self-appointed neighbourhood-watch volunteer, has prompted demands that the shooter to be arrested. Under Florida's controversial &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, that is likely not possible. The law says people have the right to use deadly force if they &quot;reasonably&quot; believe they or another person are threatened with death or serious harm. Zimmerman was detained but released by police who say they believed his account that Martin started the scuffle and that he fired in self defence. Under the law, there is no need to prove imminent danger or the need to use deadly force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Canada, we have had our own self defence debate in recent years. The result is a streamlined law that gives those acting in self-defence more leeway and should avoid future cases such as that of Toronto shopkeeper David Chen who was charged with assault and forcible confinement after tying up a man who had stolen some plants. Clarifying archaic laws is a good thing, but giving vigilantes power to take the law into their hands is not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">TALLAHASSEE </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Rick Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi have appointed a special prosecutor to take over the investigation of the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, responding to increased pressure from national civil rights leaders outraged over the killing of the unarmed, black 17-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott appointed State Attorney Angela Corey of Jacksonville as special prosecutor on the same day beleaguered Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee temporarily stepped down after being bitterly criticized for not arresting George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot Martin and claimed self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott also appointed a task force to look into the state's first-in-the-nation &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which allows individuals to use deadly force when they feel threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott's actions came two days after he met with a group of 50 black lawyers and civil rights activists who asked for a special prosecutor and a task force on racial profiling, which they said was at the heart of the Martin shooting and behind many other &quot;stand your ground&quot; defenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the governor's announcement came the day after several Democratic black state lawmakers asked him to remove Seminole County State Attorney Norman Wolfinger, whom they accused of being too close to Lee and the sheriff's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmakers hailed Scott's swift response. &quot;This will temporarily prevent the powder keg from exploding right now, because the black community will feel that at least there will be somebody who will give a good look to see if Mr. Zimmerman committed a crime,&quot; said Sen. Gary Siplin, D-Orlando, whose district abuts Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to Scott agreeing to turn over the Martin case, Wolfinger said he was stepping aside &quot;in the interest of public safety&quot; and to &quot;avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Thursday, Lee announced he was temporarily stepping down to let passions cool. His decision came after a split city commission gave him a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote. Lee has said evidence in the case supported Zimmerman's claim that the Feb. 26 shooting of Martin was self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights groups have held rallies in Florida and New York, saying the shooting was unjustified. Al Sharpton and the slain teen's family addressed a fiery crowd of about 1,000 supporters Thursday in downtown Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want an arrest, we want a conviction and we want him sentenced for the murder of my son,&quot; said Martin's father, Tracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department and FBI have opened a civil rights investigation. Wolfinger had scheduled a grand jury to convene April 10 to determine whether to charge Zimmerman. That grand jury is still scheduled to meet, but not under Wolfinger's supervision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott said the task force looking into the 2005 law would be headed by Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll, who is black, and the Rev. R.B. Holmes Jr., a Tallahassee civil rights icon and pastor of the Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we exercise our right to be free and secure both in public and in the privacy of our own homes, it is important that we have an open and honest discussion on these issues, so that we might help avoid such tragedies in the future,&quot; Scott said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Oscar Braynon, who represents the South Florida district where Martin lived with his mother, said he hopes to be appointed to the panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These steps are the kinds of steps we need to take to get that justice that everybody's rallying about as we speak,&quot; said Braynon, D-Miami Gardens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Miramar, said the shooting confirmed his &quot;greatest fear&quot; about the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law: &quot;This law is a license to kill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Plantation, said on his Facebook page that Zimmerman &quot;should have been held in custody and certainly should not be walking free, still having a concealed weapons carry permit. From my reading, it seems this young man was pursued and there was no probable cause to engage him, certainly not pursue and shoot him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- Some of the nation's foremost civil rights activists Thursday night rallied hundreds of people -- the overwhelming majority of them African-Americans -- in a call for justice following the fatal shooting of a black 17-year-old last month by a neighborhood watch volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, NAACP president Ben Jealous and a number of religious leaders and elected officials crowded onto a small, makeshift stage in a lakeside park for a rally that began with a prayer and ended with a promise to work for fair treatment under the law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People ask me today if I'm afraid of violence happening,&quot; Rev. Sharpton said. &quot;No, I'm afraid of the violence that has already happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged the more than 1,000 people gathered to be &quot;dignified and determined&quot; while they call for a fuller investigation and changes in the legal system. Tensions have been building in the Florida town and reverberating throughout the country in the month since embattled Sanford police Chief Bill Lee Jr. and his officers decided not to arrest George Zimmerman after he fatally shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, who was unarmed, on Feb. 26. Police say Mr. Zimmerman is white; his family says he's Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was returning from a trip to a convenience store when Mr. Zimmerman started following him, calling police dispatchers to say the teenager looked suspicious. The two then got into a fight and Mr. Zimmerman pulled out his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman has said that shooting was self-defense. He told police Trayvon attacked him after he had given up on chasing the teenager and was returning to his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting has ignited racial tensions, with civil rights groups calling the shooting unjustified. City commissioners in Sanford gave the police chief a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote in a 3-2 decision late Wednesday. Chief Lee, 52, was hired in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Lee announced at a hastily called news conference Thursday that he was temporarily stepping down, saying he had become a distraction to the investigation. Hours later, Gov. Rick Scott announced that the local state attorney, Norman Wolfinger, had recused himself from the case and that a task force led by Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll, an African-American, will conduct hearings on the case and make recommendations for any changes to state law or procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday evening, civil rights activists including Dick Gregory and Martin Luther King III, and state and federal legislators from Florida came to this small Orlando suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Sanford, called the rally &quot;a teachable moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want only one thing and it's real simple,&quot; she said. &quot;I want an arrest. We must get this case in the criminal justice system, but it must start with an arrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett, who early this week traveled to Washington, D.C. to meet with federal justice officials, spoke briefly to the crowd, saying, &quot;I come before you with a heavy heart. I have two sons, and I wonder what if it had happened to them? How would I feel? What would I do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The throng gave Mr. Triplett a lukewarm response, mixed with some booing, until he was called back to the stage by Ms. Brown, who demanded that the crowd give him &quot;his proper respect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that when she reached out to the mayor he traveled to Washington, D.C. the next day to work with her on the issue and authorized the release of the controversial 911 tapes that have incensed people across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a clear blue sky, people of various ages and races gathered to hear the leaders' messages, many of them carrying signs as well as bags of Skittles and cans of Arizona iced tea, the items Trayvon was carrying when he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Sanford resident Kellie Campbell, 36, the mother of three sons, this was her seventh rally since the shooting of Trayvon in a gated community less than 10 miles from her home. Ms. Campbell, who is black, said she has witnessed racial bias firsthand and has told her sons to &quot;keep your heads up and don't let it bother you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has to be a change,&quot; she said. &quot;I would describe the mood here as motivated. Something's going to happen, and it's about time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Campbell described the black community in Sanford as being divided into three groups: &quot;the church-going people, the street people, and then the people in the middle who just don't give a damn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People at the park for the rally were mostly African-American and mostly optimistic about the possibility of change for their community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford resident Sim Jackson Jr., 57, said the chief &quot;should resign, the way he handled this case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jackson, who is black and retired from the U.S. Navy, said that he has experienced bias from the local police in the three years he has lived in Sanford, and said that he has cautioned his son in how to deal with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've witnessed it. I've lived through it. And I try to explain it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeing the civil rights leaders come to this community to speak on this matter is &quot;extremely important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to make something good come out of this,&quot; he said. &quot;This city needed this. I'm not talking about losing a child's life, but change. Something to bring about change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leadership from the outside was necessary, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The local people haven't done enough,&quot; he said. &quot;They are angry about the way they've been treated for years, but it took the sacrifice of a young man's life to do something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. John Long of National Action Network in Daytona Beach, Fla., disagreed, saying the catalyst for change is here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every community has resources and people of goodwill,&quot; Rev. Long said. &quot;People can come from outside to inspire, showing the example of what has been done before. But no one can come from outside and lead the people to success. It has to be indigenous.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama today called the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager in a Florida suburb a &quot;tragedy&quot; and said that &quot;every aspect&quot; of the case that has rallied civil rights activists should be investigated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in personal terms, Mr. Obama expressed sympathy for the parents of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, who was shot on Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla., a suburb of Orlando, by a neighborhood watch volunteer who said he was acting in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son he'd look like Trayvon. I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans take this with the seriousness that it deserves and we're going to get to the bottom of what happened,&quot; Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department and FBI have opened a civil rights investigation and a grand jury is considering whether to charge George Zimmerman, who acknowledged shooting the teen but said it was self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORLD BANK HEAD NOMINATED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama today nominated Dartmouth College president and global health expert Jim Yong Kim to lead the World Bank, an unconventional pick that could help to quell criticism in the developing world of the U.S. stranglehold on the international organization's top post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said Mr. Kim, a Korean-born physician and pioneer in the treatment of HIV, AIDS and tuberculosis, has the breadth of experience on development issues needed to carry out the financial institution's anti-poverty mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time for a development professional to lead the world's largest development agency,&quot; Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW-HOME SALES FALL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Sales of U.S. new homes fell in February for the second straight month, a reminder that the depressed housing market remains weak despite some improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commerce Department said today that new-home sales dropped 1.6 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 313,000 homes. Sales have fallen nearly 7 percent since December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While a mild winter and three months of strong job growth have lifted re-sales, those conditions haven't benefited the new-home market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FACEBOOK WARNS EMPLOYERS ABOUT PASSWORDS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- Facebook is warning employers not to demand the passwords of job applicants, saying that it's an invasion of privacy that opens companies to legal liabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social networking company is also threatening legal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Associated Press story this week documented cases of job applicants who are being asked, at the interview table, to reveal their Facebook passwords so their prospective employers can check their backgrounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a post today, Facebook's chief privacy officer cautions that if an employer discovers that a job applicant is a member of a protected group, the employer may open itself up to claims of discrimination if it doesn't hire that person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT IS A &quot;march madness&quot; not of the basketball kind. Across America,  outraged people are marching for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old  black male armed with a package of Skittles and an ice tea, who was  shot dead by George Zimmerman on Feb. 26 in a gated community in  the Florida city of Sanford.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Fate throws out Dickensian moments, surnames and locations that are  metaphors for something else. Back in the 1970s, there weren't a  lot of black people on television. No Huxtable family yet. There  were Fred and Lamont Sanford, father and son proprietors of a  junkyard. The show was funny, I guess, and it probably broke as  many stereotypes as it perpetuated. But the Sanfords were not  people you would find living in a gated community. So I find some  irony in that the place where Martin died at the hands of a  community watchman bears the same name as a 1970s show about black  people. Too little has changed in 40 years.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Are we supposed to believe Martin looked suspicious because he wore  a ubiquitous item of teen clothing, a hoodie? Was it the hoodie or  was it simply that Martin was a black teen walking in a nice  neighborhood? A grand jury will hear the case and have to decide.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    A hoodie is not an excuse for the use of lethal force. But maybe in  Florida it is. Just as at one time in America some people found  justification in another kind of hoodie justice, one meted out by  men in white hoods. What happened in Sanford is in some ways more  dangerous to the American way of life than the Klan.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Klan worked in shadows, thriving in pockets of bigotry. Few  Americans feel affinity for the Klan, but many Americans are  willing to take justice into their own hands. That is chilling.  Americans are arming themselves, cradling guns wrapped in the  Second Amendment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Constitution states the right of every citizen to bear arms. It  is silent about every citizen having the judgment to use them.  Considering that the first U.S. secretary of the Treasury was shot  dead by a sitting vice president of the United Sates, I do not know  why we continue to hold to the notion that our Founding Fathers had  a firm grasp over the dangers of everybody having a gun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    But as long as the National Rifle Association can all but  pistol-whip compliant legislators in statehouses and in Congress,  our nation will be at risk not just from criminals who want to do  harm, but from ill-equipped individuals packing heat.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The NRA tells the public guns don't kill people; people kill  people. Until people can spew out bullets with lethal force from  their mouths, it will be guns that kill people. And it will be  individuals who should never have had access to a gun doing most of  the killing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    From a &quot;castle doctrine,&quot; a concept that one can defend oneself at  home, which is like a castle, states like Florida have created  &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws that can be summed up in three words: Make  my day. It is not about self-defense; it is about serving up  vigilante justice. It is a law designed to protect the person  wielding lethal force more than safeguard the victim of that force.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    It has been reported that a 911 dispatcher told Zimmerman to stop  following Martin, to let police do what they are trained to do. The  advice was not heeded. It is hard to comprehend how a man inside a  vehicle, with a gun no less, could feel so threatened by an unarmed  teen on foot that he had to use lethal force.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Outside that vehicle, Sanford 2012 begins to feel like a  pre-Huxtable America, where guilt by hoodie is probable cause for  the firing of a gun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    I lived in Los Angeles during the Rodney King riots. I have seen  close-up what happens when racial tensions erupt. In a divided  America, I do not know where this &quot;march madness&quot; will take us. It  took three weeks for the national consciousness to become aware of  what happened in Sanford. Why so long? And why, after three months  -- not weeks -- is there no national interest in how a man who  suddenly fled a police station after turning himself in ended up  shot dead in a garage in Garfield, N.J.? Malik Williams is no less  dead than Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. And Williams' death is equally shrouded  in unanswered questions about the use of lethal force. This is a  national conversation to be had.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Huxtables, again by a chance of fate, said goodbye to their  television fans at the very same time Los Angeles was burning over  the Rodney King verdicts. Several years later, the real Dr.  Huxtable, Bill Cosby, lost his son to roadside gun violence.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    A gun is not an idea, not a principle, not a Creator-given right  like life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is a thing,  nothing more.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    America cannot come to easy terms with racism. It is part of our  culture, our history. Today, things are better than they were --  unless they are not, which means that it all depends where you are  at any given moment in time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    So on Feb. 26, George Zimmerman stood his ground. And Trayvon  Martin died on it.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 23--Standing in a circle around a campus fountain, Virginia State University students sang &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; at a rally Thursday for slain Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is haunting to hear teens sing a protest anthem their grandparents sang 50 years ago, hopeful their grandchildren never would have occasion to repeat its heartbreaking chorus:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are not afraid </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are not afraid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are not afraid some day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was afraid as he was followed by a stranger in an SUV in a gated community of Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had set off on foot from the house of his father's fiancee for a nearby convenience store. Heading back with a bottle of tea and a bag of Skittles, he was spotted by an overzealous neighborhood watch volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, who grew up in Prince William County, deemed the black youth in the hoodie suspicious, followed him against the advice of a 911 dispatcher (and neighborhood watch protocol) and ultimately shot him in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman -- citing fear of an unarmed youth he reportedly outweighed by 110 pounds -- claimed self-defense and was released without charges by Sanford police. Nearly six decades after the slaying of 14-year-old Emmett Till, an act of inexplicable brutality against an African-American teenager has been carried out with impunity, to the horror of a nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Somebody said that history repeats itself,&quot; said rally organizer Ylyahkim Yisrayl. &quot;But I disagree with that, because history never left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That history -- including lingering concerns about the fairness of the criminal justice system, the value of black life vs. white life, and the gun lobby's pervasive influence over public policy -- was exposed like an unhealed wound in the aftermath of Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecuting Zimmerman will not be easy because of Martin's inability to tell his version of events and Florida's ill-advised Stand Your Ground law. Adopted in 2005, it says that a person who reasonably believes deadly force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm has no duty to retreat from a confrontation outside the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides Florida, 24 states have similar laws. Oddly, gun-happy Virginia is not one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside one's home, Virginia is &quot;a no-retreat jurisdiction by case law, but not by statute,&quot; said Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Washington-based Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early March, Republicans in the House of Delegates killed &quot;castle doctrine&quot; legislation that would have allowed home occupants to use lethal force against intruders without threat of criminal charges, even though the bill had cleared both chambers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats, and some Republicans, objected to the legislation, arguing it could be used to justify wrongful killings. Ironically, opponents of the bill included members of the gun lobby, who feared the legislation unintentionally would weaken the self-defense status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the morning rally at VSU, a candlelight vigil was held in Richmond on Thursday evening at what is believed to be the site of a burial ground for free and enslaved black people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tiamba Wilkerson of the Defenders for Freedom, Justice &amp; Equality suggested the vigil's location, a parking lot until its reclamation last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the big issues in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, in my opinion, is related to the idea that black lives don't have any value,&quot; she said. &quot;So anything that happens to us isn't taken seriously. You get the sense no one really cares. That was one of the big issues around reclaiming the burial ground -- reaffirming the humanity. I felt like there was a connection there in those struggles in that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It just seemed like a very good place,&quot; said Defender Ana Edwards. &quot;It is a focal point for talking about historical issues in the black community in Richmond -- one of them being empowerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the murder of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin does anything, it once again reinforces the feeling of powerlessness we have over our children.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm here to explain why George Zimmerman is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This seems necessary given the confusion and anger with which some readers responded to my use of that word last week in this space to describe the man who last month shot an unarmed black teenager named Trayvon Martin to death in Sanford, Fla. One person wrote: &quot;Mr. Zimmerman was Hispanic not White plez do your homework before writing your column!!!!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is they who are wrong. There are two reasons. The short one is this: &quot;Hispanic&quot; is not a race, but an ethnicity. As the U.S. Census Bureau puts it in its 2010 Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin, &quot;People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be any race.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long reason begins with an understanding that the word in question -- race -- is a term both meaningful and, yet, profoundly meaningless. It is meaningful in the sense that it provides a tool for tribalism and a means by which to organize our biases, fears, observations, social challenges and sundry cultural products. It is meaningless in the sense that, well ... it has no meaning, that there exists no definition of &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot; that carries any degree of scientific precision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are taught to think the opposite, that &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; are self-evident and immutable. But I invite you to look up Walter White, the blond, blue-eyed &quot;Negro&quot; who once led the NAACP, or Gregory Howard Williams, the university president who didn't even know he was black until he was 10 years old. Dig up the old Jet magazine story about a woman who gave birth to twins -- one &quot;black,&quot; one &quot;white.&quot; Then think again. Race is a fraud -- a cruel and stupid fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people who came here from Europe did not automatically consider themselves &quot;white.&quot; They identified as Irish, Hungarian, Italian, Jewish, Armenian. As David R. Roediger observes in his book, &quot;Working Toward Whiteness: How America's Immigrants Became White,&quot; they were emphatically taught that &quot;white&quot; was the identity that conferred status and privilege and that it was defined by distance from, and antipathy toward, black. They were advised to avoid being friendly with blacks or else put their whiteness at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor did Africans kidnapped into slavery think of themselves as &quot;black.&quot; They were Mandinkan, Fulani, Mende, Songhay, Wolof. &quot;Black&quot; was something imposed upon them as justification for slavery and other means of exploitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one historian puts it: Africans did not become slaves because they were black. They became black because they were enslaved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well into the 20th century, America recognized dozens of &quot;races.&quot; In that America, people we now regard as white -- the Irishman, Conan O'Brien; the Armenian, Andre Agassi; the Jew, Jerry Seinfeld -- could not have taken for granted that they would be seen that way. People like this had to become white, had to earn whiteness, a feat African-Americans have found impossible to duplicate, no matter how many harsh chemicals they use on their hair and skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White, then, is not simply color, but privilege -- not necessarily in the sense of wealth, but rather in the sense of having one's personhood and individuality respected, a privilege so basic I doubt it registers with many whites as privilege at all. We're talking about the privilege of being seen, of having your worth presumed, of receiving the benefit of the doubt and some human compassion, of being treated as if you matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider that, then consider the fair-skinned Hispanic man, George Zimmerman, who evidently stalked and killed an unarmed kid he wrongly thought was up to no good, yet was not arrested, nor even initially investigated. He said it was self-defense. Police took him at his word and sent him on his way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Folks, that's not just white. It's blinding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- If you've followed the story of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and the outrage over his killing, you will want to join us for a panel discussion Tuesday, 6 to 8 p.m., at Nile Hall, 668 13th St., inside Preservation Park in Oakland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation will focus on the particulars of the Martin case and how images of men and boys of color in the media and popular culture impact perception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum is free and open to the public. Seating is limited and is first-come, first-served.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the national conversation about the role Trayvon's race and attire played in his death, we thought it was important to have a community conversation about the media images of boys and men of color,&quot; said Dori Maynard, president of the Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, who is co-sponsoring the forum along with the Oakland Tribune and Bay Area News Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope this conversation will go beyond talking about the negative perceptions of coverage to also talk about ways in ways in which the media can better cover boys and men of color. Hopefully this dialogue will deepen the relationship between the news media and the community, resulting in more nuanced coverage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joining Maynard on the panel will be Kevin Weston, of New America Media; W. Kamau Bell, a comedian who attacks racism and prejudice through humor; and Thomas Peele, Bay Area News Group digital investigative reporter and author of the book, &quot;Killing the Messinger,&quot; which details the slaying of former Oakland Post Editor Chauncey Bailey and takes a detailed look at the racial dynamics that gave rise to the Black Muslim sect whose members were later responsible for Bailey's death. BANG Community Engagement Editor Martin G. Reynolds will moderate the discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, from Florida, was slain by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman several weeks ago. Zimmerman has remained free despite increased calls for his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even President Barack Obama weighed in Friday, saying, &quot;If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting took place Feb. 26, when Zimmerman, 28, pursued, confronted and fatally shot Martin, an unarmed high school student carrying only an iced tea and a bag of Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has said the shooting was in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While patrolling the Sanford, Fla., gated community where Martin's father lived, Zimmerman reportedly told a police dispatcher, &quot;This kid is up to no good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been no indication Martin was doing anything but walking home. Zimmerman's supporters have said he is not a racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what led Zimmerman to view Martin as a threat? Join us to share your views and discuss this important issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 23--The failure to make an arrest in the shooting death of Miami-Dade teenager Trayvon Martin could be sending the wrong message to neighborhood watch groups, state legislators and South Florida residents say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, of Miami Gardens, was followed and confronted by George Zimmerman, the head of a neighborhood watch group in Sanford, even though a police dispatcher told Zimmerman that he didn't need to pursue the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford police haven't arrested Zimmerman, who argues the Feb. 26 shooting was self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is letting people think, 'I could possibly use deadly force and get away with it,'&quot; Sen. Chris Smith, D-Fort Lauderdale, said Thursday. &quot;I think you will see an increase in armed neighborhood watches. That's a concern for the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the killing sparks an increase in vigilante-style confrontations remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Florida's law enforcement agencies tell their sanctioned Citizens on Patrol volunteer programs, as well as local neighborhood watches: Report suspicious activity to 911. Don't play police officer. Don't pursue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're told not to intervene, only to report suspicious activity,&quot; said Broward sheriff's spokeswoman Veda Coleman-Wright. &quot;They're prohibited from carrying weapons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day of the Sanford shooting, Zimmerman called a police non-emergency line to report a person unknown to him as suspicious. Zimmerman can be heard pursuing Martin, even after dispatchers tell him not to. He describes Martin as a black male who looked like he was &quot;up to no good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unclear exactly what happened during the altercation, but Martin died from a gunshot wound to the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith plans to spearhead a rewrite of Florida's Stand Your Ground law, which he says is too vague in allowing the use of deadly force in &quot;self-defense&quot; situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he doubts the controversy surrounding Martin's killing would deter overzealous residents from carrying weapons during patrols. Floridians are allowed to have firearms and conceal them if they have a permit, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting criticized for shooting a teenager is &quot;one thing,&quot; Smith said. &quot;But not getting arrested and convicted because people think it's legal under the law? Oh God, I could just imagine what kind of message that sends out to the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beryl Collins, 72, president of the Lauderhill Central Residents Association, said her neighborhood's watch program, established five years ago, is essentially a pact among residents to look after one another's property, complete with &quot;neighborhood watch&quot; signs added near roadways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins said it would be reprehensible if any residents opted to conduct armed patrols. &quot;It's a very bad idea,&quot; she said. &quot;Because people like that are going to be trigger-happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said neighbors' phone calls to 911 have lead to several home burglary arrests over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It can be done without a gun,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's actions were against guidelines followed by countless volunteer programs across the United States, according to the National Sheriffs' Association, a nonprofit which officially launched the Neighborhood Watch Program in 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent statement, Aaron D. Kennard, the association's executive director, referred to Zimmerman as a &quot;self-appointed neighborhood watchman&quot; who &quot;significantly contradicts the principles&quot; of watch programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kennard said the association had no record of Zimmerman's group registering as a neighborhood watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The alleged participant ignored everything the Neighborhood Watch Program stands for, and it resulted in a young man losing his life,&quot; Kennard wrote.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">718 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 23--Let me go out on a limb here: George Zimmerman could get off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, Sanford's now infamous neighborhood watch captain-turned-vigilante fatally shot a black teenager whose only crime was hoping to enjoy the second half of the NBA All-Star Game with a bag of Skittles and a drink of iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, law enforcement decided to do something in the face of national outrage. Florida Gov. Rick Scott and the U.S. Department of Justice are investigating. Even the county prosecutor finally convened a grand jury -- next month -- to probe the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin shooting. Too late to prevent the scorn heaped on Sanford, a sleepy central Florida community once known as the world's celery capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Zimmerman did, in my view, can't be explained without the words &quot;bigot,&quot; &quot;cold-blooded&quot; and &quot;killer&quot; slipping into the conversation. The words I'd use to describe how the local state attorney's office and the town's answer to the Keystone Kops have handled the case would be much worse, so I won't. (I'm told the Keystone Kops analogy is inappropriate. They at least tried to solve their cases.) Zimmerman's still free; Martin's dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides shedding light on an ongoing reality that continues to plague young black men, the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin shooting also brought some much needed scrutiny to Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, and what it reveals is the legal morass some legislators, police, prosecutors and, yes, pundits, warned back in 2005 when the idea sailed through the Legislature and was signed into law by then Gov. Jeb Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida and at least 18 other states now have Castle Doctrine laws. What's seen as self-defense in one state may be grounds for a manslaughter indictment in another. Still, five years after the law's enactment, the number of justifiable homicides in Florida tripled, according to a Tampa Bay Times examination of Florida Department of Law Enforcement statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now police, prosecutors and judges must sort through the conflicting allegations and testimony to make the law work. Sometimes they get it right, but all too often the Stand Your Ground decisions raise eyebrows in both the court of law and public opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven year-old law basically expands the time-honored legal doctrine, which permits people to use lethal force to protect themselves against intruders in their homes or automobiles, to just about anywhere where individuals have a right to be. The law allows the use of deadly force when a person &quot; ... reasonably believes it is necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the record, I am no fan of &quot;Stand Your Ground,&quot; but I understand the frustration of the law's proponents who rightfully argue Zimmerman went far beyond the bounds of the law when he ignored police warnings and confronted Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately the Zimmerman case, if or when it goes to court, could produce an unexpected result. Just this week a Miami Dade County circuit court judge threw out a case involving a man charged with second degree murder after chasing another man for more than a block before stabbing him to death. The reason for the surprising decision: the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the controversy continues. The shooting is Topic A on most social media. Chicago, New York, Miami and Tallahassee have been home to rallies protesting the shooting, and a major demonistration led by civil rights activist-turned talk show host Al Sharpton took place in Sanford itself. For many, the anger is justified. For African Americans, the stakes are much higher -- survival, particularly for young men like Martin living in a society that too easily tolerates senseless death in the name of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the midst of the controversy, Gov. Scott promised a review of the law, which prompted a quick rebuke from people like National Rifle Association lobbyist Marion Hammer, who insists there's no problem with it. The governor should, pardon the pun, stand his ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sentiment to separate Zimmerman from the law reminds me of another NRA mantra: &quot;Guns don't kill, people do.&quot; Maybe so, but try telling that to those who knew Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 23--AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- On the day President Obama commented for the first time on the fatal shooting of unarmed Trayvon Martin in Sanford, All-Star guard Dwyane Wade and his Miami Heat teammates also injected themselves into the conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was shot a month ago after a confrontation in a gated community with neighborhood-watch captain George Zimmerman, with the youth's body discovered Feb. 26.  Zimmerman who has claimed he shot Martin in self-defense, has not been charged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was wearing a &quot;hoodie&quot; hooded sweatshirt when he was shot, which has added to the debate about racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, Wade on Friday posted to his Facebook page a picture of himself wearing a hoodie. On his Twitter account, he simply posted, &quot;#hoodies #stereotype #trayvonmartin&quot; with a link to the photograph of himself wearing a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, LeBron James posted a picture on his Twitter account of the entire Heat team in hooded sweatshirts, apparently taken at the team hotel, with the Twitter post, &quot;#WeAreTrayvonMartin #Hoodies #Stereotyped #WeWantJustice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various rallies held in support of Martin have asked participants to wear hoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a father,&quot; Wade told the South Florida Sun Sentinel following Friday morning's practice at the Palace of Auburn Hills, in advance of Friday night's game against the Detroit Pistons. &quot;It's support of the tragic thing that has taken place. No matter what color, race, we're all fathers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you think about what that family's going through, it hits you hard and it hurts your heart to think about it. Just anything you can do, obviously we can't bring him back, but anything you can do to get behind and support is what we're doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wade said he felt it was the perfect time to present the photo of himself in the hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a picture that I've taken before. I thought it was great opportunity to use it,&quot; he said. &quot;I've never used it before, really. So that was a great opportunity to use it. Just to get the people to understand what we're in support of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday in Washington, President Obama said, &quot;I can only imagine what these parents are going through, and when I think about this boy, I think about my own kids, and I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this and that everybody pulls together, federal, state and local, to figure out how this tragedy happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wade, a father of two, said he felt it imperative to enter the conversation. His girlfriend, actress Gabrielle Union, had already voiced her outrage over the handing of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We discussed it,&quot; Wade said. &quot;I only start doing something when I find out more information on it. Early on, I didn't hear the [911] call, I didn't have a lot of information. So I wasn't going to just jump into it. She knew a lot early on about everything. That's why she was very vocal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wade had taken a high profile with various charitable causes but, until Friday, had largely remained on the side on politically charged issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday, South Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson spoke on the U.S. House floor, calling the incident &quot;a classic example of racial profiling quickly followed by murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following Friday's practice, Heat guard Mario Chalmers posted on his Twitter account, &quot;Our prayers are with the Martin family.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aftershocks of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's killing continued to reverberate Thursday as the embattled police chief who's been bitterly criticized for not arresting a neighborhood watch volunteer in the shooting death of the unarmed black teenager left the case Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shooting has ignited resentment toward the police department in this Orlando suburb. It has sparked a couple of weeks of uproar on social media websites. Civil rights groups have held rallies in Florida and New York, saying the shooting was unjustified. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Thursday night, thousands at a rally led by civil rights leader Al Sharpton at a downtown Sanford park demanded more be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We cannot allow a precedent when a man can just kill one of us ... and then walk out with the murder weapon,&quot; said Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sanford police Chief Bill Lee's decision to step down temporarily came less than a day after city commissioners gave him a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote. Lee has said evidence in the case supported George Zimmerman's assertion that he shot 17-year-old Martin on Feb. 26 in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I do this in the hopes of restoring some semblance of calm to a city which has been in turmoil for several weeks,&quot; Lee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About three hours later, Gov. Rick Scott announced that the local state attorney, Norman Wolfinger, had recused himself from the case. In a letter to Scott, Wolfinger said that while he thought he could fairly oversee any prosecution that develops in the case, his recusal was aimed at &quot;toning down the rhetoric and preserving the integrity of the investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scott appointed Angela B. Corey, the state attorney for the Jacksonville area, to take over the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scott also created a statewide citizen task force to review Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The governor's news was welcomed with boisterous cheers by the thousands gathered in the Sanford park to attend the rally with Sharpton. Flanked by Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, the celebrity civil rights activist said Lee's decision to step down temporarily was not enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We didn't come here for a temporary leave of absence,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;We came here for permanent justice. Arrest Zimmerman now!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> George Zimmerman, 28, was the neighborhood watch captain at The Retreat at Twin Lakes, a townhouse complex in the small town north of Orlando. A Hispanic former insurance agent with a history of reporting the presence of black men to police, Zimmerman shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in the chestafter calling police saying he saw someone in a hoodie walking too slowly in the rain, peering at houses. After the shooting, he told police he was attacked and fired in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The relationship between the boy's family and police deteriorated from the start. Martin's family believed the police department deliberately covered up Zimmerman's past arrest record, portraying him as having a clean record because he had no convictions. The family filed a lawsuit to force the department to release 911 tapes in the incident but felt the department was eager to release information that was favorable to Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Witnesses whose account differed from Zimmerman's said their calls were not returned, and it was Martin's dad who discovered a key witness, a girl who was talking to him on the telephone moments before the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The parents and their attorney, Benjamin Crump, met Thursday afternoon with U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida Robert O'Neill, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division Roy Austin Jr. and other representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency's civil rights division, the FBI and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement are reviewing the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;First and foremost, we extended and continue to extend our deepest condolences to the family for their loss,&quot; the DOJ said in a statement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the rainy night of Sunday, Feb. 26, 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin walked to a convenience store in Sanford, Fla. On his way home, with his Skittles and iced tea, the African-American teenager was shot and killed. The gunman, George Zimmerman, didn't run. He claimed that he killed the young man in self-defense. The Sanford police agreed and let him go. Since then, witnesses have come forward, 911 emergency calls have been released and outrage over the killing has gone global.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trayvon&nbsp;Martin lived in Miami. He was visiting his father in Sanford, near Orlando, staying in the gated community known as The Retreat at Twin Lakes, where Zimmerman volunteered with the Neighborhood Watch program. The Miami Herald reported that Zimmerman was a &quot;habitual caller&quot; to the police, making 46 calls since January 2011. He was out on his rounds as a self-appointed watchman, packing his concealed 9 mm pistol, when he called 911: &quot;We've had some break-ins in my neighborhood, and there's a real suspicious guy ... this guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later in the call, Zimmerman exclaims, &quot;OK. (They) always get away. ... (Expletive), he's running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sounds of Zimmerman moving follow, along with an utterance from Zimmerman, under his breath, that might have been racially derogatory.The sound of his running prompted the 911 operator to ask, &quot;Are you following him?&quot; Zimmerman replied, &quot;Yeah,&quot; to which the dispatcher said, &quot;OK, we don't need you to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the attorneys representing the Martin family, Jasmine Rand, told me: &quot;The term ...on the audiotape ... is a very obvious racial slur against African-Americans. We also heard the neighbors come forward and say, 'Yeah, in this particular neighborhood, we look for young black males to be committing criminal activity.' And that's exactly what George Zimmerman did that night. He found a young black male that he did not recognize, assumed that he did not belong there, and he targeted him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another 911 call that has been released is from a woman who hears someone crying for help, then a gunshot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Eyewitnesses Mary Cutcher and Selma Mora Lamilla both heard the cries, which police say could have been from Zimmerman, thus supporting his claim, even though he had a gun and outweighed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by 80 pounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cutcher said at a press conference: &quot;I feel it was not self-defense, because I heard the crying. And if it was Zimmerman that was crying, Zimmerman would have continued crying after the shot went off. The only thing I saw that night - I heard the crying. We were in the kitchen. I heard the crying. It was a little boy. As soon as the gun went off, the crying stopped. Therefore, it tells me it was not Zimmerman crying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sanford police Chief Bill Lee, who temporarily stepped down Thursday, has defended his department's decision to notarrest Zimmerman. They bagged Martin's body and took it away, labeling him a &quot;John Doe,&quot; even though they had his cellphone, which anyone, let alone law enforcement with a shooting victim, could have used to easily identify a person. They tested Martin's corpse for drugs and alcohol. Zimmerman was not tested. Neighbors say that Zimmerman loaded things into a U-Haul truck and left the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So, while the police and State Attorney Norm Wolfinger have defended their inaction, a demand for justice has ricocheted around the country, prompting a U.S. Justice Department investigation and leading Wolfinger to promise to convene a grand jury. The Rev. Glenn Dames, pastor of St. James AME Church in nearby Titusville, has called Martin's death &quot;a modern-day lynching.&quot; His demand for the immediate arrest of Zimmerman was echoed by the organizers of the &quot;Million Hoodie March&quot; in New York City, named after the often racially stereotyped sweatshirt Martin was wearing in the rain when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has called for the removal of Lee. NAACP President Ben Jealous, recounting a mass meeting in a Sanford-area church Tuesday night, quoted a local resident who stood up and said, &quot;'If you kill a dog in this town, you'd be in jail the next day.' Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was killed four weeks ago, and his killer is still walking the streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With his gun.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief of a Florida town where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a neighbourhood watch volunteer said on Thursday he would temporarily step down from his job, saying his role in the investigation had become too much of a distraction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee had been heading up the investigation into the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by watch captain George Zimmerman, 28. The incident has sparked a nationwide public outcry over Florida's Stand Your Ground law, which Zimmerman says makes the killing self defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have declined to arrest Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee called himself a distraction and said it had become &quot;apparent that my involvement in the matter is overshadowing the process.&quot; He has been on the job less than one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford City Manager Norton Bonaparte, speaking at a press conference at City Hall, said he was starting a search for an interim police chief. In the interim, he said, two current captains will head the police force, which has 140 officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What the city of Sanford wants more than anything else for the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin family is justice,&quot; Bonaparte said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee's decision to step down comes a day after Sanford's city commissioners passed a motion of no confidence in him and follows calls for his resignation by civil rights groups angered over the police department's handling of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee previously said he had no choice under Florida's controversial Stand Your Ground law but to let Zimmerman go free. The 2005 law allows someone in fear of &quot;great bodily harm&quot; to respond with deadly force, and removes any duty to retreat if possible to avoid confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Feb. 26, Martin was returning to a gated community from a candy run at a convenience store when Zimmerman, carrying a licensed handgun in his role as a neighbourhood watch captain, saw him. He called police to report a &quot;suspicious guy&quot; and followed him despite the dispatcher's advice not to do so. Neighbours said they heard a scuffle, cries for help and then a gunshot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY WILLIAM MARCH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tampa Tribune</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. PETERSBURG Alex Sink, former and possible future Democratic candidate for governor, blasted Gov. Rick Scott for his handling of the controversial shooting death of a Sanford teenager in a speech to a political discussion group Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If she were governor, Sink told the Suncoast Tiger Bay Club, &quot;You wouldn't be getting some made-up statement from the press shop of the governor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I were governor, I would be out front saying we have to stay calm, but justice must be done, it will be done, and we're going to be very aggressive about holding the FDLE accountable for reviewing the Sanford Police Department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sink lost narrowly to Scott in 2010, and has left the door open to running against him in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her speech sounded passionate and partisan -- much like that of a candidate -- and also bashed Republican presidential candidates for focusing on such issues as birth control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sink lost in 2010 by 1.2percent, and is a top subject of speculation about which Democrat will challenge Scott, a Republican perceived as unpopular and vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 2014 race, she said, &quot;My response is the same to everybody, even to my own husband -- I've learned never to say never. ... That decision about whether I run again will be for a later time next year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the controversy about insurance coverage for birth control, she said, &quot;Can you believe that the contest for the presidency of the United States is going to be about birth control? ... We need to be focused on the economy and education and the environment and a meaningful energy policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women come up to me outraged, particularly from a group of people who say -- what are their little lines, 'Less taxes, less government and more freedom' -- and they want to be in the bedroom and in the doctor's office with me?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked which other Democratic candidates would be competitive in the governor's race, Sink named four, a couple of whom seem unlikely, but omitted several top subjects of speculation, including former Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio, state Democratic Party Chairman Rod Smith and state Sen. Nan Rich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sink named Jacksonville Mayor Alvin Brown, who took office in July; Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn, who took office in April; Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer and Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jack Seiler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retired University of South Florida political scientist Darryl Paulson, a Republican who attended the meeting, said Sink omitted her toughest likely competitors if she runs, and criticized her for omitting Iorio and Rich after bashing Republican attitudes toward women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a questioner suggested the 2010 race had been &quot;yours to lose,&quot; Sink denied that and defended her effort, saying she faced overwhelming forces -- &quot;a big tsunami of anti-Washington, anti-Democratic sentiment,&quot; plus the $72 million Scott spent out of his own pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Democratic candidates in Florida and nationwide, including expected winners, lost by larger margins than she did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you get outspent 2-to-1 and the headwinds are against you, we just weren't quite able to come up with those last 60,000 votes,&quot; she said. &quot;I am so sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sanford, the unarmed teenager -- Trayvon Martin -- was shot and killed Feb.26 by a neighborhood watch captain, while walking home after a trip for candy to a convenience store. The shooter was not charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sink responded to a question about the Martin case with obvious anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you hear the circumstances ... in my opinion, if this had been a black man with a gun shooting a young, 17-year-old white boy, there's no doubt that the shooter would be in jail today,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unfortunate death of the black teenager in Sanford has riled the black community, but there is no justification not to investigate the facts before arresting or not arresting the shooter. Would they want us to make a snap judgment had it been a black person shooting a white person? The shooter is certainly not going anywhere, so let the investigation run its course. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson planned to attend a rally in Sanford to further incite the people who are asking for the shooter to be arrested immediately, and talk about unequal justice. If Sharpton and Jackson are so concerned about justice and the law, why haven't they addressed the fact that blacks (12.9 percent of the U.S. population) have been arrested for about 50 percent of the murders and &quot;non-negligent&quot; manslaughters in this country? That seems way out of whack and should be looked into by black activists and community leaders. The numbers I cited are in the FBI Uniform Crime Report for the latest full-year (2010) stats. Previous years are listed, and the percentages are about the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not saying George Zimmerman should not be prosecuted if he is found at fault. The needless loss of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's life is a tragedy, as is the loss of any person, no matter the race or ethnicity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who speaks for Martin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Louis Stevenson had a clear vision of the hazards inherent in Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law. As Long John Silver famously noted: &quot;Dead men tell no tales!&quot; So we hear George Zimmerman's allegations that he shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in self-defense. But the voice of Trayvon has been silenced, and he cannot tell us his account. Who speaks for him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much better off we would be if our legislators had had the foresight to consider Long John Silver's stark observation when they passed this law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After reading the headlines this week about the U.S. soldier who shot Afghanistan civilians, I couldn't help noticing an irony: There is all this clamor to try this guy quickly and execute him, never mind him having suffered a traumatic brain injury. Yet Maj. Nidal Hassan, who shot up Fort Hood while screaming, &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; (&quot;God is great&quot; in Arabic), still hasn't stood trial, and they are still debating whether he was insane, even with the clear evidence regarding his motive: Slay as many infidels as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we have a guy in a war zone who cracks, and he must be executed immediately. But a Muslim psychiatrist who was stateside in a nice, safe office all day murders 13 and wounds 32 of our own guys, and they try to argue the poor lad suffered post-traumatic stress syndrome, from listening to real soldiers who had actual battle experience.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Scott signs drug testing for state workers bill - March 19</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Florida Legislature passed the bill requiring general drug testing for all state workers, our representatives and senators conveniently excluded themselves from this requirement. A supporter of the bill, Rep. Jimmie T. Smith, R-Lecanto, stated that elected officials couldn't be included because the U.S. Supreme Court has held that requiring elected officials to submit to the test was unconstitutional. The representative is being dishonest on this, and the people of Florida deserve to know the truth on this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court case that Rep. Smith referred to is Chandler vs. Miller, 520 U.S. 305 (1997). In that case, Georgia passed a law requiring elected officials to pass drug tests as a condition of service. The court ruled that the law was unconstitutional, in that it imposed an unreasonable search without special circumstances being present. The court did not limit its reasoning to elected officials, as Rep. Smith would have the people of Florida believe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, the very case he attempts to rely on will be the case used to strike down the law that he and the Florida Legislature did pass. That the Georgia law targeted elected officials did not limit the reason it was struck down. Mr. Smith's argument is like taking a case that holds an owner of a dog liable for the dog's bites, and claiming that it would not apply to the owner of a bear for the bear's bites.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a real virtue to our system of government in which legislators make laws, police enforce laws and courts administer laws. This case shows exactly why justice administered through legal means is so much better than independent &quot;justice&quot; administered by self-appointed vigilantes to anyone they consider to be an undesirable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state attorney needs to prosecute this case with full vigor. Otherwise, &quot;stand your ground&quot; becomes a license to murder with utter impunity. And if the NRA believes that &quot;guns don't kill people, people kill people,&quot; it should make a public stand here about inappropriate use of guns, especially by safety patrol volunteers. There are way too many accidents and deliberate shootings lately, and respected parties like the NRA need to take aggressive action to educate gun owners so that people can go to church, celebrate the Fourth of July, and walk to convenience stores safely.</SPAN></P>

It is imperative to determine what comprehensive management procedures should be enacted so this cancer does not spread throughout the entire department.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of its 60-day session, the Legislature left many issues on the table that would have triggered long-term benefits for Florida's education system. Legislation was proposed to allow for high-performing public charter schools to serve more students across the state, and to give more dollars andopportunities to public charter school students. These proposals, however, were unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our legislative goal on behalf of Florida's public charter schools is to expand school choice and give our students access to the best public education option that fits their individual needs and provides them with the tools to be successful. If the proposed legislation had passed, it would have allowed for more public charter schools to be built, removed nearly 50,000 children off the charter school waiting list, employed more teachers, and provided parents with more choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's public charter schools have produced results. With innovative staff and curriculums, charter schools are meeting the needs of an increasingly diverse student population. However, charter school students still receive less funding and have a smaller percentage of capital outlay or &quot;facilities&quot; funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have started the conversation on the need for equitable funding for public charter school students, and we look forward to continuing the conversation and our efforts to provide more opportunities for all children to receive a high-quality education.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watchman in Sanford should be a cautionary tale for homeowners associations, experts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances - a volunteer watchman carrying a gun, and questions over whether he did enough to avoid shooting the unarmed teenager - could put the homeowners association where the incident took place in legal hot water. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in many cases like this one, the residents don't know they could be liable until a tragedy occurs, when they find out that their homeowners association only carries insurance for directors and board officers, not volunteers who patrol streets or maintain common areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are ripple effects on everybody in a community,&quot; said Donna DiMaggio Berger, a managing partner with the statewide law firm of Katzman Garfinkel &amp; Berger, which represents more than 2,000 homeowners associations. If volunteers take matters into their own hands, &quot;the association is going to get sued.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to reports, George Zimmerman, 28, called police from his car after noticing Martin walking through the neighborhood. Later in the call, Zimmerman said the teenager was running away. The dispatcher advised Zimmerman not to follow and said that an officer was on the way. Minutes later, Martin was killed by a bullet to the chest, which Zimmerman said he fired in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's family has not sued the Retreat at Twin Lakes, where the shooting took place and Zimmerman was the captain of the neighborhood watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berger said if the association knew Zimmerman regularly carried a weapon while on volunteer patrol, that could provide Martin's family with further ammunition in a lawsuit. She also advised that using professional security guards or law enforcement officers can help avoid these types of legal entanglements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you have safety and security issues, don't hire a citizens brigade,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Associations should learn the backgrounds of volunteers and check with insurance carriers to determine whether more coverage is needed, Berger added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safety is a selling point that draws buyers to certain neighborhoods. As the foreclosure aftermath flooded streets with empty houses, homeowner associations found smaller budgets to maintain services. Instead of paying outside firms, many now marshal volunteers for landscaping, maintenance and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tampa-based Rizzetta &amp; Co. manages more than 100 community associations with 32,000 homes in Florida. President William Rizzetta said some HOA board members often don't consult with law enforcement agencies or attorneys when problems arise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We always caution our boards about taking matters into their own hands,&quot; he said. &quot;We fight that all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Schumaker, an attorney with Trenam Kemker in St. Petersburg, said neighborhood watches serve a vital role in housing developments. But leaders of the groups need to be explicit when instructing volunteers about their roles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Residents are not allowed to take action against someone else,&quot; he said. &quot;They should just call the police quickly. Anything else is bordering on vigilantism.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The possibility that Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law could protect a neighborhood watchman who shot and killed an unarmed teen last month has lawmakers who opposed the measure saying told you so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we passed the law, we said it portends horrific events when people's lives were put into these situations, and my worst fears came to fruition,&quot; Sen. Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, said this week. &quot;A young life was snuffed out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joyner was in the state House when &quot;stand your ground&quot; passed in 2005 and fears the law - which allows people to use deadly force in cases of self-defense when they believe their life is at risk - could save 28-year-old shooter George Zimmerman from prosecution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in the Orlando suburb of Sanford on Feb. 26, police say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the investigation unfolds, it's worthwhile to look back to the origins of the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law and the concerns legislators like Joyner had at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measure passed the Senate 39-0 seven years ago Friday and the House 94-20. It was signed into law by Gov. Jeb Bush. Joyner and 19 other House Democrats voted against the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To check her claim, we went to the video archives to see what was said during House debate on April 5, 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For a House that talks about the culture of life, it's ironic that we would be devaluing life in this bill, which is exactly what we're doing,&quot; said Rep. Dan Gelber, a former federal prosecutor from Miami Beach who later was elected to the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gelber said Floridians already had the right to defend themselves in their homes and offered an amendment that would restore a person's duty to retreat from a confrontation in public places. Rep. Eleanor Sobel, a South Florida Democrat who now serves in the Senate, said Gelber's amendment would reduce &quot;chaos on the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans defeated Gelber's amendment on a voice vote. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, called an obligation to retreat &quot;a good way to get shot in the back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;''Stand your ground'' is being invoked more often and is applied unevenly. Gov. Scott will convene a panel to study the controversial law.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversial law that police have cited in their decision not to charge the man who shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin has been invoked at least 130 times statewide since 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Tampa Bay Times survey, compiled from 31 Florida newspapers and public records, shows that the number of cases in which &quot;stand your ground&quot; has been invoked has climbed dramatically in the past year and a half. The analysis shows that police and prosecutors continue to apply the law unevenly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As pressure mounts to charge George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who ignored police advice not to confront the unarmed teen on Feb. 26, Gov. Rick Scott announced he would convene a task force to study the law. No group keeps a tally of cases in which Florida Statute 776.013 (3) - commonly known as the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law - is invoked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law expands a citizen's right to use deadly force anywhere that he has a right to be if he &quot;reasonably believes&quot; it is necessary to stop another person from killing or hurting him badly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times analysis shows that more than 70 percent of the 130 cases involved a fatality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the majority of the cases, the person who plunged the knife or swung the bat or pulled the trigger did not face a trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 50 of the cases, the person who used force was never charged with a crime. Another nine defendants were granted immunity by a judge, and nine cases were dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 10 cases, the defendant pleaded guilty to lesser crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 28 cases that made it to trial, 19 people were found guilty of a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-two cases are still pending. (The outcomes of two could not be learned by press time.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times analysis also shows that &quot;stand your ground&quot; is being invoked with greater frequency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first five years the law was in effect, it was invoked 93 times. In the last year and a half, it has been invoked at least an additional 37 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justifiable homicides&quot; reported to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement have increased threefold since the law went into effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proponents say the law is working, allowing citizens to protect themselves from harm without worrying about legalities in the heat of the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the law has also been used to excuse killings in bar brawls, gang shootouts and road-rage incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if history serves, it's no wonder Zimmerman has not been arrested. Depending on how a police chief, prosecutor or judge interprets the law, which asks them to consider something as nebulous as a man's state of mind, they may find that under the law Zimmerman was justified in shooting young Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Wednesday's town hall meeting in Sanford, where more than 400 people sat inside the Allen Chapel AME Church and another 200 or more rallied outside, state Rep. Geraldine Thompson, D-Orlando, said repealing the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law would be a top priority for the Legislature's black caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What about Trayvon's right to stand his ground and defend himself?&quot; she asked. &quot;How do you claim self-defense when you're in an SUV and you pursue a person on foot? How did Trayvon provoke an attack when he was running away?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem that often hamstrings police and prosecutors is that there are often no witnesses. Two people meet in the dark, one of them kills the other, and the narrative of what happened solely belongs to the person interested in staying out of jail, the analysis shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Arthur Hayhoe, executive director of the Florida Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, heard about the Martin case, &quot;I went to my files and yanked out all the ones like it,&quot; he said. &quot;I found 15.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them was a 2010 incident in Town 'N Country in which a man on a jog about 1 a.m. was punched in the face by a teenager. The man thought he was being robbed so he pulled a gun, and the teen started to run. The man fired eight shots. Four hit the teen. The man was not charged with a crime. His court file says &quot;justifiable homicide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Tampa Bay area, the law has been invoked 31 times. Hillsborough County leads the state with 14 such cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several cases have prompted much controversy, including an incident in which a man who stabbed another with an ice pick was cleared of wrongdoing and one in which a man who legally carried a gun to a neighborhood park to shoo away a skateboarder shot and killed a man who confronted him. That case is pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police chiefs and prosecutors have decried the law for years, but it wasn't until the Martin shooting that notable Republicans, including the bill's author, Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, have said the law may need to be reconsidered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as I'm concerned, that neighborhood watch guy was breaking that law as soon as he started following that kid. He was stalking him. That's not standing your ground,&quot; said Rep. Richard &quot;Rich&quot; Glorioso, R-Plant City, who voted for the bill. &quot;If the law is applied right, it's a fine law. But we worried about how people would interpret it, and how it would be applied, when we were discussing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therein lies the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The analysis shows the law is being unevenly applied across the state. A case that's dropped in Tampa might make it to a jury trial in Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hayhoe said the Martin case shows a clear need for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's surprised it hasn't happened earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of these cases don't go beyond the local paper,&quot; he said. The Martin case is different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's been more dialogue in the last three days than we've gotten for seven years,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE RULING: TRUE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The possibility that Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law could protect a neighborhood watchman who shot and killed an unarmed teen last month has lawmakers who opposed the measure saying told you so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we passed the law, we said it portends horrific events when people's lives were put into these situations, and my worst fears came to fruition,&quot; Sen. Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, said March 20, 2012. &quot;A young life was snuffed out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joyner was in the state House when &quot;stand your ground&quot; passed in 2005 and fears the law - which allows people to use deadly force in cases of self-defense when they believe their life is at risk - could save 28-year-old shooter George Zimmerman from prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman killed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in the Orlando suburb of Sanford on Feb. 26, police say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the investigation unfolds, it's worthwhile to look back to the origins of the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law and the concerns legislators like Joyner had at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measure passed the Senate 39-0 and the House 94-20. It was signed into law by Gov. Jeb Bush. Joyner and 19 other House Democrats voted against the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To check her claim, we went to the video archives to see what was said during House debate on April 5, 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For a House that talks about the culture of life, it's ironic that we would be devaluing life in this bill, which is exactly what we're doing,&quot; said Rep. Dan Gelber, a former federal prosecutor from Miami Beach who later was elected to the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gelber said Floridians already had the right to defend themselves in their homes and offered an amendment that would restore a person's duty to retreat from a confrontation in public places. Rep. Eleanor Sobel, a South Florida Democrat who now serves in the Senate, said Gelber's amendment would reduce &quot;chaos on the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans defeated Gelber's amendment on a voice vote. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, called an obligation to retreat &quot;a good way to get shot in the back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members debated another unsuccessful amendment from Rep. Jack Seiler, a Democrat who is now mayor of Fort Lauderdale. Seiler's proposal would have allowed for rebuttal to a person's claim of self-defense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An author of Florida&Otilde;s &quot;stand your ground&quot; legislation has been defending the law on national television, warning that it may not have anything to do with the recent death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was an African-American 17-year-old who was watching a basketball game at a friend&Otilde;s apartment complex in Sanford, Fla. During a break, he walked to a nearby store for candy and iced tea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he was out, a resident, George Zimmerman, reported him to 911 as acting suspicious. The operator told Zimmerman not to pursue Martin, but Zimmerman shot Martin a short while later. Police didn&Otilde;t arrest Zimmerman, and that angered Martin&Otilde;s family and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also got people talking about Florida&Otilde;s &quot;stand your ground&quot; law. The law allows people to use deadly force in cases of self-defense when they believe their life is at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, told MSNBC&Otilde;s Tamron Hall on March 21, 2012, that the law protects people who are attacked, but it does not protect aggressors. &quot;There&Otilde;s nothing in this statute to protect people who are pursuing and confronting other people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hall asked Baxley about crime statistics that show justifiable homicides are up in Florida, but Baxley said that&Otilde;s only one statistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we&Otilde;ve learned is if we empower people to stop bad things from happening, they will,&quot; Baxley said. &quot;And in fact, that statistic is coupled with another statistic. That is the fact that we&Otilde;ve had a dramatic drop in violent crime since this law has been in effect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with PBS Newshour the next day, Baxley added that he thought the law &quot;has saved thousands of people's lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, we&Otilde;re checking whether there&Otilde;s been a dramatic drop in violent crime since the law went into effect. To do that, we turned to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement&Otilde;s crime statistics and various news reports about violent crime in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found that violent crime has dropped significantly in Florida since 2005. (The law went into effect Oct. 1, 2005.) We calculated the drop in violent crime rates, to account for population growth. In 2006 and 2007, violent crime rates were up just slightly up compared with 2005. In 2008, the violent crime rate began declining. By 2011, the violent crime rate had dropped 14 percent since 2005. (See chart below.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that&Otilde;s not the whole story. We also looked at crime rates for the five years before the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law started, and we found violent crime was declining during those years as well. Between 2000 and 2005, violent crime dropped 12 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we turned to news reports, we found many stories documenting drops in crime nationwide over the past decade. Experts have been surprised that the numbers have continued dropping through a historic recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are rates declining? Nobody can say for sure. The theories are highly diverse, to say the least, and some are fairly controversial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are just a few we ran across: Police are getting better at using technology to prevent crime. More people are in jail and therefore can&Otilde;t commit crimes. Online banking and debit cards mean people don&Otilde;t have cash at home. Abortions have suppressed the number of poor, unsupervised young men. Low inflation makes stealing less attractive. President Barack Obama is setting a positive example for African-American youth. New gun laws establishing the right to carry are deterring criminals. Joblessness means people are at home watching the neighborhood. Extended unemployment benefits and food stamps mean people don&Otilde;t have to turn to crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baxley told PolitiFact Florida he didn&Otilde;t think the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law was the main reason for Florida&Otilde;s drop in crime rates. But it could be one of several reasons, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don&Otilde;t want to claim all the effect,&quot; Baxley said. &quot;But in public policy, if you make changes, and things go in a positive direction, you&Otilde;re grateful. So I don&Otilde;t want to say we caused all of it, but I do think that it helped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, though, have said the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law could potentially drive up the crime rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2007, the National District Attorneys Association convened a symposium on the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law and other expansions to the right to use of deadly force in self-defense. A symposium report listed a number of concerns: Criminals might be emboldened as they learn to use &quot;stand your ground&quot; as a legal defense. More deaths could result as more people carry weapons for self-defense. People might feel less safe if they believe anyone could use deadly force in an unsettling situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More pointedly for the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, the report noted that a misinterpretation of physical clues could result in the use of deadly force, &quot;exacerbating culture, class, and race differences&quot; and that there could be &quot;a disproportionately negative effect on minorities, persons from lower socioeconomic status, and young adults/juveniles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baxley said &quot;We&Otilde;ve had a dramatic drop in violent crime since this law has been in effect.&quot; His comments in television interviews implied the law itself reduced violent crime rates. There has been a drop, but rates were declining before the law went into effect. We found no proof that that the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law caused the drop in crime rates; some groups worry the law could lead to more violence. We rate his claim Half True.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The former gubernatorial candidate rips into the Legislature in a Tiger Bay Club appearance.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not being a candidate apparently agrees with Alex Sink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's former chief financial officer came before the Suncoast Tiger Bay Club on Thursday sounding sharper and more passionate than she ever did running for governor two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known for caution and always measuring her words on the campaign trail, Sink instead blasted the Legislature for slashing $300 million from the higher education system while creating &quot;an incredibly expensive and duplicative&quot; 12th university. She called for far more focus on promoting existing Florida businesses than recruiting companies from out of state. She nearly choked up when talking about the killing of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the mother of a 24-year-old young man, my heart bleeds for this family. And when you hear the circumstances - let me just say that in my opinion if this had been a black man with a gun shooting a young, 17-year-old white boy, there would be no doubt that the shooter would be in jail today,&quot; Sink said when asked about Gov. Rick Scott's response to the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I were governor I would be out front saying, 'We have to stay calm but justice must be done, it will be done. And we're going to very aggressive about holding the FDLE accountable for reviewing the Sanford Police Department.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Democrats expect Sink to take on Scott again in 2014, having lost by just 1 percentage point two years ago, but she said she won't make any decision for at least a year. Asked what she'd learned from the loss, Sink said she faced a Republican &quot;tsunami,&quot; was outspent at least 2-to-1, and ultimately fell 61,000 votes short.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am so sorry,&quot; she said apologetically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats have plenty of up-and-coming leaders who could be future gubernatorial candidates, she said, specifically naming Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn, Jacksonville Mayor Alvin Brown, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer and Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jack Seiler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her focus now is her nonprofit charitable think tank, Florida Next, which aims to promote entrepreneurship and small businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state needs a moderate-to progressive public policy foundation, she said, noting how Scott cited an analysis by the conservative Reason Foundation when he rejected more than $2 billion in federal money for high-speed rail in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had her foundation been in place early in 2011, she said, &quot;We could have stood up as the Florida Next Foundation and said, 'Oh no, you're not right. Let us show you the research that says we have tremendous economic impact from high-speed rail.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the Republican presidential campaign, Sink scoffed at how birth control could become a front-burner issue when the country is in dire economic condition. The candidates of less taxes and more freedom &quot;want to be in my bedroom and in the doctor's office with me,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women are not going to forget what's been going on in the Republican primary,'' she said. &quot;And for those of you who are Republicans in the room, you better get your party straight. It's not right for America, it's not right for the people, and it's not what we need to be focusing on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Brian Hughes, spokesman for the Republican Party of Florida: &quot;Alex Sink, struggling to be relevant, has adopted a new, bombastic style. Unfortunately for Sink, whatever style she chooses, it is still the same old liberal message: bigger government, higher taxes and the divisive politics of race and gender.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police chief and a Florida state prosecutor overseeing the case of an unarmed black teenager shot dead by a neighbourhood watch captain stepped aside Thursday following withering criticism and national outrage that police have declined to arrest the shooter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee's resignation - which he called &quot;temporary&quot; - failed to appease civil rights and community leaders, who are calling for the arrest of watch captain George Zimmerman, 28, who shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin and claimed self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee was under mounting pressure for days and suffered a a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote from the city commission on Wednesday. The shakeup at the state level was more surprising, as Gov. Rick Scott replaced Tallahassee's lead investigator, State Attorney Norman Wolfinger, and formed a task force to review Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said this law, which allows people to use deadly force when they perceive danger in any public place, prevented them from arresting Zimmerman, a white Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coupled with at least two prior cases that stoked black anger toward the police, the response to the Martin episode had grown so intense Lee said he had no option but to step aside as &quot;my involvement in the matter is overshadowing the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Feb. 26, Martin was returning to a gated community from a candy run at a convenience store when spotted by Zimmerman, who was carrying a licensed handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman called police to report a &quot;suspicious guy&quot; and followed him despite the dispatcher's advice not to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbours said they heard a scuffle, cries for help and then the shot that killed Martin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida city at the centre of a renewed American debate on racial injustice has passed a vote of no confidence in the police chief responsible for investigating the death of an unarmed black teenager. Thousands of demonstrators, led by the civil rights leaders Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, descended on Sanford last night to demand the arrest of a neighbourhood watch leader who has admitted killing Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, as he walked home with a bag of sweets for his little brother. Despite evidence that George Zimmerman had chased the schoolboy and shot him as he screamed for help, the police did not arrest him after he claimed to have acted in self-defence. Since the boy's death on February 26, pressure has been growing on the city's police department, led by Bill Lee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Velma Williams, one of the city commissioners who called for Mr Lee's resignation, said that she had spent years trying to improve racial harmony in central Florida. She called Trayvon's death a &quot;national embarrassment&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a million people have signed an online petition set up by the boy's parents and federal authorities have launched an investigation into the police's decision not to make an arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting has re-opened the debate over racial profiling, with Trayvon's mother claiming that a schoolboy walking home is viewed as a potential criminal purely because of the colour of his skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators at a &quot;million hoodie march&quot; in New York wore hoods or baseball caps and carried bags of Skittles and iced tea as they asked whether they too should be seen as suspects. &quot;Our son is your son, I want you all to stand up for justice and stand up for what's right,&quot; Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon's mother, told the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the shooting, Mr Zimmerman called the police to report a suspiciouslooking man. &quot;He looks like he's black, [he's wearing] a dark hoodie,&quot; he said. The neighbourhood watch leader had regularly called police to report suspicious black men in his neighbourhood in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Mr Zimmerman in hiding and no lawyer employed to speak on his behalf, it has fallen to the police department to defend the alleged vigilante. Officials have repeatedly recounted Mr Zimmerman's version of events, in which he claimed to have been returning to his vehicle when he was attacked from behind by the schoolboy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recording of his conversation with the 911 operator, however, revealed that he had decided to track the boy&quot; This guy looks like he's up to no good,&quot; Mr Zimmerman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say that Mr Zimmerman was within his rights to be carrying a concealed semi-automatic weapon and that he had no obligation to follow the operator's request to wait for police assistance. The police officers who found the body decided that there was insufficient evidence to arrest Mr Zimmerman. &quot;The Sanford police decided on the scene to be judge and jury,&quot; Ms Fulton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After weeks of silence from the Florida state government, Rick Scott, the Governor, admitted that there may have been abuses of the 2005 &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which allows citizens to use deadly force in public places if they believe they are threatened. Sanford Police said that they were unable to arrest Mr Zimmerman because of the law, which was passed by the former Governor Jeb Bush.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. - Police Chief Bill Lee Jr. announced in a news conference Thursday that he would step down temporarily in the wake of a controversy over his department's handling of a fatal shooting that attracted national attention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move came as pressure to fire Lee mounted on Sanford city manager Norton Bonaparte, who was Topeka's city manager until this past July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CBS News reported Lee said that his presence had become a &quot;distraction&quot; that was &quot;overshadowing the process&quot; and that he would take a temporary leave of absence. Neither Lee nor Bonaparte took questions after the short press conference, nor did they elaborate on what &quot;temporarily&quot; meant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanford City Commission voted 3-2 late Tuesday to indicate it had no confidence in Lee over his handling of the Feb. 26 shooting of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, who is black, was shot and killed by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman, who has been identified in news accounts as being both &quot;white&quot; and &quot;Hispanic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who hasn't been arrested, said he acted in self-defense when he used the gun he was licensed to carry to shoot Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett and Commissioners Velma Williams and Mark McCarty voted in the majority Tuesday while Patty Mahany and Randy Jones voted in support of Lee, 52, who became police chief last May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioners cannot fire Lee, who works at the pleasure of Sanford's city manager, Bonaparte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Orlando, Fla., Sentinel reported Bonaparte said he would take the commission's &quot;strong statement&quot; under advisement but wanted to wait for the conclusion of investigations being conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Justice is investigating, and a Seminole County, Fla., grand jury will meet April 10 to hear evidence in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to MSNBC, &quot;Williams implied that if Bonaparte doesn't fire Lee, she would review his contract the next time it comes up for renewal. She nearly fainted after the vote because she became so emotional, and had to be treated by a paramedic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonaparte released a statement Monday on the city's website at http://www.sanfordfl.gov/investigation/docs/Zimmerman_Martin_shooting.pdf providing answers to some of the questions Sanford officials are being asked most frequently regarding the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonaparte left his job as Topeka's city manager July 1 under a severance agreement he reached with the city council. He became city manager in September of Sanford, which is about 20 miles north of Orlando and has a population of about 53,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief of a Florida town where an unarmed black teenager was shot dead by a neighbourhood watch captain stepped aside Thursday following withering criticism and national outrage that police have declined to arrest the shooter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee's resignation, which he called &quot;temporary,&quot; failed to appease civil rights and community leaders calling for the arrest of watch captain George Zimmerman, 28, who shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin and has claimed self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which allows people to use deadly force when they perceive danger in any public place, prevented them from arresting Zimmerman, a white Hispanic who has disappeared from public view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's father said his son was unfairly vilified, calling him a friend of minorities whose true nature was being distorted by national calls for his arrest and allegations he pursued Martin just because he was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coupled with at least two prior cases that stoked black anger toward the police, the response to the Martin episode had grown so intense that Lee said he had no option but to step aside because &quot;my involvement in the matter is overshadowing the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2011, a previous Sanford police chief was forced out of the job after a white police officer's son was captured on video sucker-punching a black homeless man outside a bar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford police did not immediately arrest the officer's son, Justin Collison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after video of the attack surfaced on local TV and the Internet and provoked an outcry from Sanford civil rights leaders, Collison was charged weeks later with aggravated battery and disorderly conduct. He eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanour charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident came five years after two white private security guards with ties to the police department shot and killed a black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two guards, one the son of a Sanford police officer and the other a department volunteer, said they opened fire in self-defence, claiming the teenager attempted to run them over. Evidence showed the teenager died from a gunshot in the back. The cases were eventually dismissed because of a lack of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martin case generated mostly local interest in the days following the Feb. 26 shooting but has steadily drawn the national spotlight, which has only grown in recent days since the state of Florida and U.S. Justice Department announced their own investigations and the city commission voted 3-2 in favour of a &quot;no confidence&quot; motion against Lee on Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Governor Rick Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday replaced the head of the state investigation, appointing Angela B. Corey as the &quot;assigned&quot; state attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott also announced the formation of a task force to follow up the findings of Corey's investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A crowd of at least 5,000 gathered Thursday in a Sanford park to protest the Martin case and what black leaders have called a pattern of racial discrimination in Sanford and elsewhere in a country that has elected a black president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are serious problems that go beyond this case,&quot; said Benjamin Jealous, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a leading civil rights organization.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. - The embattled police chief overseeing the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin investigation said Thursday he will &quot;temporarily remove&quot; himself from his job amid mounting criticism and pressure to charge a neighborhood watch leader with killing the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hours later, the local prosecutor, Norman Wolfinger, stepped down from handling the case, and Gov. Rick Scott appointed another state attorney to handle the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee said that he stands by his department's initial investigation but that he is stepping aside to avoid being a distraction. The case has been drawing widespread national coverage amid claims that Trayvon, who is black, was a victim of racial stereotyping. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is apparent that my role in this matter is overshadowing the process,&quot; Lee said at a news conference, adding that he felt he should remove himself from his post &quot;in the hopes of restoring some semblance of calm to the city, which has been in turmoil for several weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfinger, the local state attorney, said in a letter to the governor that his recusal from the case was aimed at &quot;toning down the rhetoric and preserving the integrity of the investigation.&quot; Scott  appointed Angela  Corey, the state attorney for the Jacksonville area, to take the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, 17, was shot Feb. 26 as he was returning to a gated community after buying candy at a convenience store. The gunman, neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, has not been charged and  said he shot the unarmed youth in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 911 calls paint a confusing picture  and it is unclear who was the aggressor  between Trayvon and Zimmerman. A 911 caller said  he saw a man on the ground screaming for help, according to a recording  on Sanford's municipal website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The caller turned to hold back his dog and then he heard the gunshot and the screaming stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who police say is white but whose family says he is Hispanic, had been following the teen on foot and called the police department to report possible suspicious behavior. Zimmerman said he lost sight of Trayvon and was returning to his truck when he was attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Manager Norton Bonaparte  said a search would begin immediately for an interim chief. Before Lee's announcement, Bonaparte told USA TODAY that he would await the  investigations  by the Justice Department  and the Florida state attorney's office before deciding Lee's fate. &quot;I want to know if there were things they should have done that they didn't do, or things they did that they shouldn't have done,&quot; Bonaparte said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday,  the Sanford City Commission voted  3-2 that it had &quot;no confidence&quot; in Lee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said outside  City Hall that Lee &quot;needs to step down, not just step aside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of people gathered at a rally Thursday night in downtown Sanford, where many of the nation's best-known black activists demanded the arrest of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zimmerman should have been arrested that night,&quot; said  Al Sharpton, president of the National Action Network. Among those with  Sharpton  were Martin Luther King III, activist  Dick Gregory  and former New York governor David Patterson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week, Lee said in an e-mail to USA TODAY there have been &quot;assumptions and conclusions&quot;  that are based on limited information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial police report of the incident says an officer noticed that Zimmerman showed apparent signs of being in a struggle. &quot;I could observe that his back appeared to be wet and was covered in grass, as if he had been laying on his back on the ground. Zimmerman was also bleeding from the nose and back of his head,&quot; the  report said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just  days after the Justice Department launched an  investigation into the fatal shooting of an unarmed Florida teenager, three white men pleaded guilty Thursday to federal hate crime charges stemming from  the horrific June 2011 murder of a 47-year-old black Mississippi man who was beaten and then run over by a pickup. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Attorney General Tom Perez said Deryl Dedmon, 19; John Rice, 19; and Dylan Butler, 20, made &quot;a sport of attacking African Americans&quot; in the Jackson, Miss., area before they were linked to the fatal  assault on auto worker James Craig Anderson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dedmon also pleaded guilty in state court Wednesday in connection with the murder and was  given two life sentences. Rice has been charged by state authorities with assault.  Butler has not been charged in state court. A state investigation continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perez said the federal charges, which carry a maximum penalty of life in prison, mark the first time authorities have invoked the federal hate crime statute -- known as the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act -- in a case resulting in a victim's death. Shepard and Byrd were both victims in high-profile hate cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department announced Monday it was reviewing events surrounding the February shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by Sanford, Fla., Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who said he was acting in self-defense. Zimmerman has not been charged  in the case, which has  sparked outrage in Florida and demonstrations in other parts of the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Anderson case, Perez said the investigation revealed  evidence of a racially motivated attack in which the three Mississippi men set out to &quot;harass and assault African Americans&quot; in the early morning hours of June 26, 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 5 a.m., according to court documents, the suspects encountered Anderson in a motel parking lot, where they severely beat him. Rice and Butler, according to court documents, were the first to leave the scene, driving away in a Jeep from which one of them  yelled, &quot;White power!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dedmon and two others  then got into a Ford F-250 truck and ran over Anderson, killing him, according to court documents. <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the Olive Street Baptist Church in Sanford, Fla., to New York's Union Square, last month's fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin has tapped into a deep vein of distrust among African Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Baptist church in Martin's hometown, stories of violence and hurt poured out from other black mothers and grandmothers. The Internet was alive with a Change.org petition demanding justice for the slain youth. Hundreds marched in Manhattan on Wednesday and rallied in Sanford on Thursday to protest the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How could it be otherwise?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the nation's history, black men, women and children have been targeted, beaten, lynched and shot, often for a wrong word or look or just being in the wrong place. Police seldom bothered to investigate.  Most died in obscurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once in a great while, though, their deaths made a difference. In 1955, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old visiting Money, Miss., was yanked from his bed, shot in the head and dumped in a river after he supposedly whistled at a white woman. Till's killers were acquitted by an all-white jury. The uproar over the injustice helped feed a fledgling civil rights movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Americans of all races hear echoes of those deaths. While much  remains unknown and new facts could emerge, the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin tragedy carries many of the classic earmarks of racial bias. Despite all of the nation's progress in burying its racist past, minorities are still commonly stopped by authorities for no other reason than the color of their skin. Try to find an African-American man who hasn't been stopped for &quot;driving while black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, it appears, made the mistake of &quot;walking while black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details have been widely reported: On Feb. 26, Martin had just come from a convenience store with some Skittles and an iced tea. He was walking in the Retreat at Twin Lakes, a gated community in the Orlando suburb of Sanford that had seen a recent rash of burglaries and thefts. He had on a hoodie, perhaps against the drizzly night. He was heading for the home of his father's girlfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, driving his SUV, spotted the teen and called 911. &quot;This guy looks like he's up to no good or he's on drugs or something,&quot; Zimmerman told a dispatcher. Armed with a gun, Zimmerman said he was following the guy. The dispatcher told him not to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman didn't listen. He left the safety of his vehicle. After a confrontation of some sort, he shot the unarmed Martin dead. Zimmerman has said it was self-defense. Sanford police didn't press charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It might well have ended there, but for a slowly building firestorm, fueled by black celebrities and columnists and social media. On Thursday, the Sanford police chief temporarily, and appropriately, stepped aside. Local prosecutors are now investigating Martin's death. So are the FBI and the Justice Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While authorities complete their investigations, a couple of questions are  worth pondering. Would Zimmerman have thought a white teen in a hoodie looked like he &quot;was up to no good&quot;?  And, most pointedly, if Zimmerman were black and had shot a white, unarmed 17-year-old, would police have let him go? <BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee was under mounting pressure and suffered a &quot;no-confidence&quot; vote from the city commission Wednesday. The shakeup at the state level was more surprising as Gov. Rick Scott replaced Tallahassee's lead investigator and formed a task force to review Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said this law, which allows people to use deadly force when they perceive danger in any public place, prevented them from arresting Zimmerman, an Hispanic who has disappeared from public view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's dad has said his son has been unfairly vilified. He called him a friend of minorities whose true nature was being distorted by national calls for his arrest and allegations that he pursued Martin just because he was black.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticism of the investigation came on top of a history of racial tension in Sanford, just north of Orlando.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 23--VALDOSTA -- The tragic shooting of an unarmed Sanford, Fla. teen is bringing scrutiny to &quot;Stand your Ground&quot; state laws and neighborhood watches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was killed by a neighborhood watch captain, who may go unpunished under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to reports, Martin was walking home from a store where he had just purchased a bag of Skittles and an iced tea for his younger brother. George Zimmerman, a self-proclaimed neighborhood watch captain, called police to report a suspicious person after he saw Martin walking near his home. Despite police instructing him not to confront Martin, Zimmerman allegedly approached the teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses say a scuffle ensued before Zimmerman shot the unarmed teen in the chest with a semi-automatic pistol, killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the incident, many have asked how it is possible that such a tragedy could happen, and more importantly, why Zimmerman has not been charged in the death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which permits a person to use deadly force if they feel threatened, has so far allowed Zimmerman to remain free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So could the same case happen in Georgia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Possibly, but not likely. The law is written differently in Georgia, stating that a person can use deadly force only if &quot;he or she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily injury to himself or herself or a third person or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about neighborhood watch programs and the law here in the city, Valdosta Police Cmdr. Brian Childress said to his knowledge, there has not been a case anywhere close to the one that occurred in Sanford. He also commended the neighborhood watch participants who assist law enforcement in making arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have organized neighborhood watch groups here locally who act as law enforcement's eyes and ears,&quot; the commander said. &quot;We constantly and religiously tell them their only job is to be aware of what's going on ... to be our eyes and ears. They cannot take the law into their own hands. They are to call us if they see something suspicious. So far, our neighborhood watch groups have been very successful for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Childress was adamant about not wanting to comment on how the law enforcement in Florida is handling the Martin case, as there is an active investigation into the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue has also spurred charges of racism as Zimmerman is white and Martin a young black male.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local Southern Christian Leadership Conference sponsored a &quot;Justice For Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot; rally Thursday evening on the steps of the historic county courthouse. The Rev. Floyd Rose said it was important for the citizens of Valdosta to get involved, not only for Trayvon, but for young black men in this community as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are joining thousands of people in cities across the United States who are calling on the Sanford (Florida) Police Department to arrest George Zimmerman who has acknowledged that he, in fact, shot and killed the unarmed teenager,&quot; Rose said. &quot;The rally is also for the mistreatment of young black men in Valdosta by city law enforcement. Not since the murder of 14- year- old, Emitt Till, in 1955, in Money, Mississippi, have I seen so much national outrage, and loud cries for justice, as I have seen in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case. No one believes that this killing was justifiable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rose went on to say if the tables were turned and a black man shot a white man, he would have been arrested and held until he could prove his case, and even then, it may take years. He reiterated that this case is nothing new but that something needs to be done to stop it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the incident, a national campaign on Change.org is calling for Florida State Attorney Norman Wolfinger to charge Zimmerman in the shooting death of Martin. More than 200,000 people have joined the campaign so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests and marches have been held in several major cities across the country, and more are planned through the weekend.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For every black man in America, from the millionaire in the corner office to the mechanic in the local garage, the Trayvon Martin tragedy is personal. It could have been me or one of my sons. It could have been any of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many George Zimmermans are out there cruising the streets? How many guys with chips on their shoulders and itchy fingers on the triggers of loaded handguns? How many self-imagined guardians of the peace who say the words &quot;black male&quot; with a sneer? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't yet know every detail of the encounter  between Martin and Zimmerman in Sanford, Fla., that ended with an unarmed 17-year-old high school student being shot dead. But we know enough to conclude that this is an old, familiar story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know from tapes of Zimmerman's 911 call that he initiated the encounter, having decided that Martin's presence in the neighborhood was suspicious. We know that when Zimmerman told the 911 operator that he was following Martin, the operator responded, &quot;Okay, we don't need you to do that.&quot; We know that Zimmerman kept following Martin anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy looks like he is up to no good,&quot; Zimmerman said on the 911 tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please tell me, what would be the innocent way to walk down the street with an iced tea and some Skittles? Hint: For black men, that's a trick question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some commentators have sought to liken Martin's killing to the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, an unspeakable crime that helped galvanize the civil rights movement. To make a facile comparison is a disservice to history - and to the memory of both young men. It is ridiculous to imply that nothing has changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Till was killed in Mississippi at 14 - accused of flirting with a white woman - this was a different country. State-sanctioned terrorism and assassination were official policy throughout the South. Today, the laws and institutions that enforced Jim Crow repression have long since been dismantled. Mississippi, of all places, has more black elected officials than any other state. An African American family lives in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black America was never a monolith, but over the past five decades it has become much more diverse - economically, socially, culturally. If you stood on a street corner and chose five black men at random, you might meet a doctor who lives in the high-priced suburbs, an immigrant from Ethiopia who drives a cab, a young aspiring filmmaker with flowing dreadlocks, an unemployed dropout trying to hustle his next meal and a midlevel government worker struggling to put his kids through college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those men would have nothing in common, really, except one thing: For each of them, walking down the wrong street at the wrong time could be a fatal mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hear from people who contend that racism no longer exists in this country. I tell them I wish they were right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does it matter that Zimmerman is himself a member of a minority group - he is Hispanic - or that his family says he has black friends? Not in the least. The issue isn't Zimmerman's race or ethnicity; it's the hair-trigger assumption he made that &quot;black male&quot; equals &quot;up to no good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one thing that hasn't changed in all the eventful years since Emmett Till's mutilated body was laid to rest. It is instructive to note that Till grew up in Chicago and just happened to be in Mississippi visiting relatives. Young black men who were born and raised in the South knew where the red lines were drawn, understood the unwritten code of behavior that made the difference between survival and mortal danger. Till didn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, young black men grow up in a society where racism is no longer deemed acceptable. Many live in integrated neighborhoods, attend integrated schools, have interracial relationships. They wonder why their parents prattle on so tediously about race, warning about this or that or the other, when their own youthful experience tells them that race doesn't matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What could happen on the way home from the store with some Skittles and an iced tea?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Zimmerman can or should be prosecuted, given Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law providing broad latitude to claim self-defense, is an important question. But the tragic and essential thing, for me, is the bull's-eye that black men wear throughout their lives - and the vital imperative to never, ever, be caught on the wrong street at the wrong time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the story of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the black Florida teen slain as he was returning from a convenience store run, has gone national, it's also become intensely local. And for many area parents, personal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attention to the case has exploded - and with it, anger. A rally was led by the Rev. Al Sharpton Thursday night in a Sanford, Fla., church. A million people have reportedly signed an online petition by Martin's parents calling for George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, to be prosecuted in the shooting. There was a protest march in New York on Wednesday that was dubbed the Million Hoodie March because Martin was wearing a hoodie at the time of his death. Supporters in the District are holding a Saturday afternoon rally in Freedom Plaza and asking people to wear hoodies or all black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young black men in America die at disproportionate rates and often without fanfare or media attention. But Martin's death has traumatized parents who had convinced themselves that raising educated, respectful black children would keep them from getting shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yvette Frye of Sterling says she has had extensive conversations with friends about the Martin killing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all have boys,&quot; she says. &quot;We're like, 'This could have been our kids.' &quot; She watches her 11-year-old son, Robby, playing basketball at the Dulles SportsPlex and recalls the conversations she and her husband have had with him about Martin's death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is one of the reasons we don't want you to walk to school by yourself,&quot; Frye says she told her son. He is one of two black kids in his fifth-grade class, she says. They want to go outside, and they want to put a hoodie on. It's what all the kids wear, she says, but she wonders whether her neighbors might see him as a threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People speak to you all the time,&quot; she says, &quot;but what are they really thinking?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 911 tapes, Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, tells the dispatcher that Martin is suspicious and implies that he might have a weapon. Martin was found with Skittles and iced tea on him when he died. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the outpouring of anger and grief is that Martin seems to have been killed because he fit the profile of one of America's most feared figures - a teenage black kid wearing a hoodie in a place where he was not known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That fear crosses lines of race and class. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what hurts my own heart,&quot; says Gregory Taylor of Upper Marlboro. &quot;Even in my own black community, we do the same thing. If I'm at the Bowie Town Center, and there's a whole group of black men hanging out talking, my initial reaction is not one of fear, but suspicion. And that's one of the things that cuts me if I had to be honest. Those of us who have achieved a level of success and moved out of the 'hood, we even have those suspicions. Some is real, and some is just the same stereotypes perpetrated on us relentlessly by the media. It just bombards us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor, who heads his own anesthesia services company, has an 18-year-old son. As details emerged about Martin - a student who earned A's and B's, who played sports and had no criminal record - Taylor wrote an e-mail to family and friends: &quot;We have become so desensitized in this country, heck, even in our own communities to the killings of young black males. But this one hits you squarely in the heart and gut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he sent the e-mail to others who he thought would understand. Those of us &quot;who raise these black men not to be like society expects, to be the anti-stereotype, and they can still get shot.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Tony Lee is pastor of Community of Hope AME church in Hillcrest Heights. The church shifted the focus of a Wednesday panel discussion on volunteerism and activism to talk about Martin and action that could be taken locally. Lee says it helps to give people concrete steps, particularly because there is so much outrage that Zimmerman has not been charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sick people do sick things, but the challenge with injustice is about when the system is sick,&quot; Lee says. There's a need for people to agitate &quot;for the system to be held accountable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other piece, he says, is counseling young people who are anxious. We're just &quot;trying to help work them through the challenges around their need for safety. Trying to walk them through the fear piece.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willie Diggs Jr., 51, runs a basketball academy in Reston. He remembers that some Virginia schools were slow to desegregate and counts his being able to teach kids of all backgrounds at Dulles SportsPlex as a sign of progress. But as the father of three African American sons, 17, 20 and 25, he's also clear about the negotiations he has had to make with the culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His 17-year-old son had cornrows before he went away to prep school &quot;and we had a rule,&quot; Diggs says. &quot;He had a Honda that seated five, but he could never have more than two passengers in his car because as an African American male with cornrows in Virginia, he fit any profile out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At basketball camp, Diggs says, he teaches girls not to cry, and &quot;my boys can't give attitude, because you never know the kind of day the cop, teacher, judge might be having,&quot; and the fates of black boys can rest on the slimmest of margins. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday night during Diggs's practice, a parent, Susan Mitchell, a government contractor from Leesburg, says she has talked about Martin with friends on Facebook and via e-mail, and with her daughters, 13 and 18, who &quot;live in a kind of bubble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were just like, 'Really? Soda in one hand, candy in another, that could have been me. We go to Florida.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his e-mail, Taylor wrote that he was fighting off tears. He is still coming to terms with his grief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You hear the tapes where [the dispatcher] says do not follow him,&quot; he says. &quot;I get chills right now even thinking about it.'' That could have been his son that some guy was going after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've raised our sons to be genteel,&quot; he says. &quot;We've tamped down on that super-macho aggressiveness. The world expects that of him, but we raised him not to be aggressive or angry or attitudinal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now, Taylor and other parents are confronting the idea that that may not be nearly enough.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama, who has struggled to find his footing in politically charged matters of race, seems to have found an answer: Eric H. Holder Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's first African American attorney general has become the voice of the president on controversial racial issues, reaching out to black communities, pushing an aggressive civil rights agenda and stepping in when Obama cannot, or should not. That dynamic was fully apparent this week, when Holder's Justice Department launched an investigation into the case of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the 17-year-old black youth fatally shot in Sanford, Fla., last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As national protests over the case spread Thursday, the Sanford police chief stepped down temporarily in the face of sharp criticism. In Florida, Justice Department officials met with Martin's parents.And the case is certain to come up Friday when Holder talks with a group of black ministers at a previously scheduled meeting at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an administration headed by the first African American president and weighted with expectations of racial progress, much has rested on Holder, as White House aides have emphasized Obama's need to stay out of legal and local issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again this week, Holder's department has provided the White House cover with civil rights advocates, who began asking for federal intervention soon after Martin was fatally shot in a confrontation with neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On policy issues and issues that involve race, Eric Holder is now, during this campaign context, the official black guy of the Obama administration,&quot; said the Rev. Eugene F. Rivers III, senior policy adviser to the Church of God in Christ, one of the largest black denominations in the country. &quot;Because the president cannot in any way, directly or indirectly, be associated with anything that whispers race, and for perfectly logical reasons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice officials said they ordered an investigation in the Martin case solely for law enforcement reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said he is satisfied with Holder's role and the administration's response, although he would like to hear from Obama directly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has spoken through his Department of Justice on this case. They are doing more than any other Department of Justice in recent memory when it comes to taking on cases like this,&quot; he said. &quot;Still, it'd be very appropriate for our president - any president - to speak out about the need for our nation to finally deal with the issue of racial profiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, had called 911 to report a suspicious person in the gated community near Orlando. He told police he shot Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's case is the sort of emotional racial issue that has tripped up Obama, who has sought a careful balance between fulfilling the grand hopes associated with his vaunted status in U.S. race history with his practical political need to attract and keep support from skeptical working-class white voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he appears disinterested, he risks upsetting his most loyal constituency. But, as this president has learned the hard way, when he steps into matters of race, he instantly alters the news cycle and siphons headlines from his preferred themes of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Martin's shooting became a national issue this week, sparking street protests and candlelight vigils from New York to Milwaukee, the official White House response has been relative silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our thoughts and prayers go out to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family, but obviously we're not going to wade into a local law enforcement matter,&quot; White House press secretary Jay Carney said earlier this week. &quot;I don't have any conversations to report to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has learned the perils of speaking frankly about race. At a news conference in summer 2009, he said police had acted stupidly in arresting his friend, Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr., who is black, and then had to retract the statement. He later invited both the police officer and Gates to the White House for a beer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama  has not waded into another local issue since, speaking instead of race primarily in terms of the nation's history and progress rather than current events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martin case presents a complex political calculation for the White House. It is unfolding in a crucial election battleground state and one where the president is heavily courting support from blacks and Hispanics - the two ethnic groups at the heart of the controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign is seeking to mobilize black voters, many of whom may see the Martin case as a test of the president's commitment to his fellow African Americans, a commitment that has been questioned by some in that community. But central Florida is home to a large Hispanic population that has been a key swing voting bloc and one that Obama strategists see as crucial to his reelection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the incident happened in Boston, he took personal interest in what happened to a professor, and we'd like for him to do the same thing here in central Florida, because it was a little kid who was killed and now has stirred up a huge volcano that's spewing lava,&quot; said state Sen. Gary Siplin, an Orlando Democrat and a former chairman of the legislative black caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his tenure at Justice, Holder has also emphasized terror prosecutions, financial fraud and other issues, but he has drawn recent headlines for his focus on civil rights. That includes challenges to several states over rough immigration laws and voting changes, which the department has said would discriminate against minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first three years of this administration, the department prosecuted 35 percent more hate crime than the first three years of the previous administrations, a department spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a civil rights case in the news this week, Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general for civil rights, announced Thursday that the federal government's case against three Brandon, Miss., teenagers had led to guilty pleas to federal hate crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teens had attacked and killed James Craig Anderson, 47, after saying they wanted to find and attack African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a case about a group of racist thugs who made a sport of targeting vulnerable African Americans,&quot; Perez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perez said that the case, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison, is the first involving a death that was prosecuted under the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the same law that justice officials are considering in the case of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooter was once a Catholic altar boy - with a surname that could have been Jewish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father is white, neighbors say. His mother is Latina. And his family is eager to point out that some of his relatives are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There may be no box to check for George Zimmerman, no tidy way to categorize, define and sort the 28-year-old man whose pull of a trigger on a darkened Florida street is forcing America to once again confront its fraught relationship with race and identity. The victim, we know, was named Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager in a hoodie. The rest becomes a matter for interpretation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drama in Florida takes on a kind of modern complexity. Its nuances show America for what it is steadily becoming, a realm in which identity is understood as something that cannot be summed up in a single word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The images of Zimmerman - not just his face, but the words used to describe him - can confound and confuse. Why are they calling him white, wondered Paul Ebert, the Prince William County commonwealth's attorney who knew Zimmerman's mother, Gladys, from her days as an interpreter at the county courthouse. Zimmerman's mother, Ebert knew, was Peruvian, and he thought of her as Hispanic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking at Zimmerman's photograph made Darren Soto, a Florida state legislator, think he might be Latino. But he just as easily might have been Italian or French, he thought. &quot;It's all over the place in Florida,&quot; said Soto, who represents a statehouse district in Orlando, a 20-minute drive from the gated subdivision in Sanford where Martin died. &quot;You have people with Anglo first and last names who speak perfect Spanish and are from Puerto Rico. And you've got a third- or fourth-generation Joey Gonzalez from Tampa who can't speak a word of Spanish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus in Florida, where thousands gathered Thursday night in Sanford for an emotional rally, has primarily been on complaints that Martin may have been targeted because of his race. The uproar led Thursday to the temporary resignation of Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, who has been accused by demonstrators of bungling the case and criticized for not arresting Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Manassas, where Zimmerman lived in the 1980s and 1990s with his parents and two siblings, neighbors tended to define the family based on their spiritual profile. &quot;Very Catholic . . . very religious,&quot; their neighbor Jim Rudzenski recalled Thursday. The children attended All Saints Catholic School on Stonewall Road through the eighth grade before going to Osbourn High School. George became an altar server and evening receptionist at All Saints Catholic Church. The Zimmermans &quot;were known and respected in the community for their dedication and service,&quot; said Robert Cilinski, pastor of All Saints Catholic Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father, Robert Zimmerman Sr., is a retired military man. He could be strict. And the children's grandmother, who lived with the family, also kept a watchful eye, said Kay Hall, who lived across the street from the Zimmermans in a neighborhood just west of Sudley Road for about 20 years. George and his siblings &quot;didn't play with the neighborhood kids,&quot; Rudzenski said. &quot;They had to stay home and play.&quot; It was always &quot;Yes, ma'am,&quot; &quot;No, ma'am,&quot; Hall said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's life was not without difficulties. In 2001 - when he was 17 or 18 - he was the victim of a minor criminal assault, said Manassas police Sgt. Eddie Rivera. The city's computer records do not provide details of the crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In school, Zimmerman hinted at ambitions in the business world. He joined a Future Business Leaders of America club. And in his senior yearbook, he wrote: &quot;I'm going to Florida to work with my godfather who just bought a $1 million business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, Zimmerman shifted his plans, enrolling in Seminole State College with hopes of becoming a law enforcement officer. He became the self-appointed protector of the streets around his home, although his neighborhood watch organization was not officially registered. He called the police department at least 46 times since 2004 to report everything from open garages to suspicious people. In 2005, according to police records obtained by the Orlando Sentinel and other news organizations, Zimmerman was twice accused of either criminal misconduct or violence. He had a concealed-weapon permit and had a black Kel-Tec semiautomatic handgun and a holster the night Martin died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's father has sought to emphasize his family's diversity in hopes of saving his son from condemnation as a racist. While images of protests from across the country skitter past on television screens, the elder Zimmerman has tried to do what others have been doing, in various ways, for days: define his son. George is &quot;a Spanish-speaking minority,&quot; the father wrote in a letter delivered to the Orlando Sentinel. &quot;He would be the last to discriminate for any reason whatsoever.&quot; George, the father insisted, was more like the boy he killed than people thought. George was a minority - the other - too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the argument that the father is making feels hollow and self-serving to Michaela Angela Davis, an African American writer and activist who lives in New York. In her eyes, George Zimmerman's Hispanic roots don't give him cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You being a minority doesn't make you immune to racist beliefs,&quot; she said in an interview Thursday. Davis sees a pervasive cultural imprint, reinforced by media and entertainment imagery: the black man as a symbol of &quot;violence, fear and deviant behavior.&quot; A young man could be susceptible to the influence of that image whether his &quot;mother is from Peru or Norway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanics and black Americans have a shared history of discrimination in the United States. But they also have a shared history of tension - in neighborhoods, schools, even prisons. In Latin America, including Peru, Afro Latinos have frequently complained of a lack of political representation, economic disenfranchisement and the virtual absence of their image in popular culture, such as soap operas, an issue they attribute to racial exclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's legal fate could rest on examinations of possible motives that will be pieced together from clues, including snatches of audiotape, and from inquiries into whether he muttered a racial slur before the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's family background doesn't invite a racial motive, but it doesn't discount one either, said Luis Martinez-Fernandez, a professor of Latin American and Caribbean history at the University of Central Florida. Hispanics are an ethnic group, but within that group there are different races. There are black Dominicans and Cubans, for instance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who is Hispanic and who's not is not as clear as other ethnic groups,&quot; said Martinez-Fernandez. &quot;There's no such thing as a Hispanic race. It has to do with origin, culture and race. Some people argue that language should be a part. All this complicates identity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanics make up the nation's largest ethnic group at more than 13 percent of the population, while African Americans are the largest racial group, with more than 12 percent of the population. In the 2010 Census, more than half of people who identified as Hispanic said they were white, and only 3 percent said they were black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a sense that one group has been harmed historically more than the other,&quot; Martinez-Fernandez said. &quot;There's been a history of the dominant group in power pitting one group against the other. I think we have not fought together. There have been few instances of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there have been some signs in Florida that Hispanics and African Americans are forging a bond, said Soto, the state legislator. In ongoing redistricting debates in Florida, the two groups have &quot;stuck together very solidly,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If not for a quirk of fate, Martin and Zimmerman might never have encountered each other, sparing the nation a painful episode. Several years ago, Zimmerman returned to his old neighborhood and showed up unannounced at the house across the street. He came back two more times to see George Hall, a retired Presbyterian minister. Zimmerman told him that he had plans. He wanted to move back to Virginia. He wanted to be a police officer, but he needed a letter of recommendation that Zimmerman could give to prospective employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I told them he was a great guy,&quot; Hall recalled. &quot;We never did hear what happened with that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This single piece of clothing -- and the stereotype that whoever is wearing one is suspicious -- has become a flashpoint in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's what Martin wore when he was shot and killed by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman in a gated community last month in Sanford, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even President Obama is weighing in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He empathized today with the slain 17-year old's grieving parents, saying&quot; You know if i had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are gonna take this with the seriousness it deserves and get to the bottom of what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, rallies and vigils are happening more frequently with demonstrations growing in scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students in several Florida high schools took to the streets today in a show of solidarity, pushing for an arrest &Acirc;- and criminal charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So who is George Zimmerman?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's a former altar boy, and passionate -- some would even say over zealous -- protector of his gated neighborhood in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But remember this photo Zimmerman? It's actually mug shot, from an arrest for pushing a Florida state alcohol agent who tried to arrest his friend &Acirc;- a bartender, accused of serving drinks to minors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zimmerman got his act together, and by all accounts relished his role as a volunteer neighborhood watchman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Florida's black community as already weighed, but Zimmerman's lawyer, who claims the incident was not racially motivated. &quot;The answer is absolutely not. George is friends with people in the African-American community, said attorney Craig Sonner.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 23--NEW YORK -- More than 1.5 million people, including countless New Yorkers, have signed a petition http://www.change.org/petitions/prosecute-the-killer-of-our-son-17-year-old-trayvon-martin at change.org encouraging Attorney General Eric Holder, himself a New Yorker, to thoroughly investigate the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. The main response on Friday to the case, though, came from Holder's boss, the President of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he&Acirc;'d look like Trayvon,&quot; President Barack Obama said in a response to a question about the case of the killing of the unarmed teen, asked after the president's White House Rose Garden announcement of a new World Bank president. &quot;And I think [Trayvon's parents] are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and that we&Acirc;'re going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened,&quot; President Obama said in a clear indication that the shooting that took place in suburban Orlando a month ago is now a national issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in the evening on February 26th that Sanford Florida neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman shot and killed Martin, 17. Zimmerman told police that he'd acted in self-defense when he shot the unarmed teen who was on his way home from picking up a bag of Skittles and an iced tea for his younger brother from a 7-11 near the condo where Trayvon was staying with his father and his father's fiancee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told local investigators that he had found the teen, who was wearing a hoodie in the rain of that evening, suspicious. Zimmerman followed Trayvon, against the order of a police dispatcher Zimmerman had called at the time. Sanford cops did not arrest Zimmerman, citing no probable cause, pending a local investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, however, in the wake of a national outcry that has led to the Sanford police chief temporarily stepping down, and the prosecutor for the Sanford area recusing himself, federal and state agents are also investigating, and calls for thorough justice come from the very top of the legal system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think all of us have to do some soul-searching to figure out how does something like this happen,&quot; President Obama said. &quot;And that means... examine the laws and the context for what happened, as well as the specifics of the incident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family responded to the president's comments in a written response. &quot;It is humbling that President Obama took time from his busy schedule to talk about Trayvon and offer the support of the Department of Justice and other federal organizations,&quot; the written statement said. &quot;The President's personal comments touched us deeply and made us wonder: If his son looked liked Trayvon and wore a hoodie, would he be suspicious too?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president mentioned Eric Holder at the beginning of his comments, saying that as &quot;the head of the executive branch... the attorney general reports to me, so I&Acirc;'ve got to be careful about my statements to make sure that we&Acirc;'re not impairing any investigation that&Acirc;'s taking place right now.&quot; Holder met with some African-American religious leaders a couple of hours after the president's late morning comments and, in the meeting that had been scheduled long before the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case had become so intense, Holder updated his visitors on the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington will also be the scene on Saturday of a demonstration in support of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Georgia last in public corruption laws&quot; (ajc.com, March 19), and &quot;Lobbyist transparency? Oh yeah, that's the ticket&quot; (Opinion, March 15), I commend the AJC news team and the editorial staff for their coverage concerning public corruption in Georgia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have reached the point where we have no confidence in state government to accomplish anything well, from HOT lanes to T-SPLOST plans to tax reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot expect a more effective government until we require an honest and ethical government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To AJC columnist Kyle Wingfield: Please don't hesitate to name names. Keep the pressure on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as we approach election time, help to identify legislative candidates from both parties who will enact and enforce ethics rules. JAMES VESSER, CONYERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABORTION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Pro-life' people should adopt unwanted kids</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Passing bill right thing to do&quot; (Opinion, March 16), while I do not believe abortion is an optimal method of birth control, and Dan Becker may be correct about an unborn child's ability to feel pain at 18 weeks, he has overlooked pain of another kind: the constant pain of being an unwanted, unloved child who is abused, beaten, molested or assaulted, or scarred for life because of that kind of pain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have millions of children in this country in foster care and juvenile facilities --- the progeny of parents who did not want children enough to be responsible for their well-being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our mental health facilities and prisons are full of these children (now adults). Their quality of life means nothing to most individuals who advocate the pro-life position --- only that they are here and breathing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once they are here, they are someone else's responsibility. This position is socially irresponsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until every proponent of the pro-life cause adopts one of these children, they have no sustainable platform. I say, put your beliefs where your rhetoric is. Then you can shout your pro-life stance to the heavens with a clear conscience. LAURA E. TAYLOR, BUFORD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FLORIDA SHOOTING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Age of harmony still elusive in America</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The year is 2012. So much has changed, yet much has remained the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an African-American president in the White House, one would imagine that things have changed for the better --- but is that true?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A civilian recently decided that a black teen was acting &quot;suspiciously&quot; and the civilian ended up shooting Trayvon Martin to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When will we really give up the ghost of &quot;taking back the country&quot; and reverting to the &quot;good old days&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have come a long way --- but apparently, there is still a long way to go. DAVID CLARKE, BUFORD</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON. A London court has sentenced a star of the Harry Potter films to two years in prison after he admitted to taking part in last year's London riots. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie Waylett, 22, who played school bully Vincent Crabbe in six of the films, was found guilty of violent disorder by a jury at London's Wood Green Crown Court after earlier admitting to stealing a bottle of champagne from a supermarket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actor, from Hampstead in north London, was part of a mob of youths who joined in as the riots swept through Chalk Farm in north London on August 8 last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waylett, who already has a previous conviction for cannabis possession, was cleared of intending to destroy or damage property with a petrol bomb he was seen to be holding.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin, 17, was shot on February 26 in a gated community in central Florida by a neighbourhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, who later was released by police after claiming he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Martin's family, said on Tuesday Martin had put on a hoodie after getting caught in the rain and was not aware he was being followed by Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PITTSFIELD -- A group of concerned citizens is planning to rally at Park Square on Friday evening to protest the killing of an unarmed teenager in Florida and the decision of authorities there not to arrest the shooter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really believe the tragedy was not just that this young man was gunned down, but the injustice done by the system down there in Florida that has still not arrested this man,&quot; said Ty Allan Jackson of Pittsfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson, a local author who is organizing the event as part of the S.E.E.D network, said he expects a crowd of about 100. The rally is scheduled to take place between 5:30 and 7:30 p.m. on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin, 17, was killed Feb. 26, in Sanford, Fla. He was returning to a gated community in the city after buying candy at a convenience store. He was unarmed and was wearing a hooded sweatshirt, called a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanford neighborhood's watch captain, George Zimmerman, has not been charged in the shooting. Zimmerman has said the teen attacked him and he shot him in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like similar protests in New York City and elsewhere, those rallying at the Park Square events will wear hoodies to express solidarity with Martin and his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson called the failure of police to arrest Zimmerman for shooting the young, black teen a &quot;slap in the face for people of color.&quot; He said he hopes to increase awareness of the incident through the Pittsfield rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's frustrating to witness this violence and be powerless,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;But we're not powerless and we have a voice. And it's important to use that voice to let the world know that we're no longer going to tolerate these injustices and we're going to hold people accountable.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buffalo community activists Randy Sargent and Tyrone Ferguson said they will see if they need permits from City Hall to keep their new &quot;Voice of Homicide&quot; group's protest going in Niagara Square over the killing of an unarmed 17-year-old in Sanford, Fla., last month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several dozen members of Occupy Buffalo on Wednesday night joined about a dozen people who came out to support Sargent and Ferguson and their efforts to seek justice for the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a black teenager who was shot to death Feb. 26 by George Zimmerman, a Neighborhood Watch volunteer in a gated community in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Occupy Buffalo group also returned to Niagara Square for a general meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sargent said he expects to lead a protest march around the square beginning at about 6 a.m. today. He will be joined by Ferguson when he completes other scheduled business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sargent and Ferguson said they plan to continue a peaceful protest in the square for the slain Martin &quot;until there is justice&quot; in the case, Ferguson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two said they plan to protest from about 6 a.m. to midnight seven days a week until law enforcement takes action against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was visiting his father in a townhouse in a Sanford gated community and had gone to a nearby convenience store for snacks in the light rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, captain of the community's Neighborhood Watch, called police and said he was following a &quot;suspicious&quot; person. By the time police arrived, they found Zimmerman with a bloody nose and Trayvon facedown in the grass, shot in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman claimed he shot the youth in self-defense. He has not been charged with any criminal activity, but a grand jury is reportedly about to begin reviewing the fatal shooting of the unarmed teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday evening in Niagara Square, Chris Barbara, a member of the Occupy Buffalo movement, said his organization was joining in the protest being staged by Sargent and Ferguson &quot;because Occupy Buffalo supports all nonviolent efforts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sargent and Ferguson said they hope their efforts will prompt similar protests nationwide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel very honored that New York would do a rally in my son's honor,&quot; Martin told The Associated Press on Wednesday, hours before what was being called the Million Hoodie March was to take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It means a lot to me and my family knowing that people across the country, across the world, are coming together to get justice for Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The march splintered into various groups, with some demonstrators heading to Times Square for an impromptu rally and dozens of others making their way to downtown Manhattan. At times, it appeared the march had become indistinguishable from an Occupy event, with some protesters climbing atop the Wall Street bull sculpture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Zimmerman is white; his family says he is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has ignited a furor against the police department of the Orlando suburb of 53,500 people, prompting rallies and a protest in Gov. Rick Scott's office Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said it is sending its community relations service this week to Sanford to &quot;address tension in the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the week, the federal agency opened a civil rights probe into the shooting, and in Florida, Seminole County State Attorney Norm Wolfinger said a grand jury will meet April 10 to consider evidence in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin said he and his son's mother, Sybrina Fulton, found out about the march after arriving in New York City, where they have done some interviews about the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They got in touch with the organizers to say they would come and speak to the attendees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing of Martin's parents being in the city when the march is happening is &quot;incredible,&quot; said Daniel Maree, one of the organizers. He heard about the case earlier this week, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, information surrounding the teen's death has been coming out, including 911 calls, and on Tuesday, an account from his family's lawyer of a conversation he had with his girlfriend in the moments before his death was released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The Associated Press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked how he was holding up as all this information comes out, Tracy Martin said he was trying to stay strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't feel this is the time to break down, even though it's a very troubling time in my life,&quot; he said. &quot;I've told myself, when I get justice for Trayvon, then I'll have my time to break down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrik Jonsson Staff writer</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1213 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven years after Florida enacted a landmark gun rights law that became a model for other states, calls are mounting from the public and some state officials, including Gov. Rick Scott (R), to reassess it in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teen, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, by a neighborhood watch captain who apparently confronted Trayvon after deeming that he looked suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A coalition of black Florida lawmakers has asked House Speaker Dean Cannon, a Republican, to open hearings on the Stand Your Ground law, which removes any duty by an armed citizen to retreat from danger and allows the use of deadly force if there's a reasonable fear of death or grave harm. Mr Cannon says he wants to wait until more facts are known about the incident, and until state and federal investigations are wrapped up, before he decides whether to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, state Sen. Chris Smith, a Broward County Democrat, has said he's writing a bill that would bar a shooter from claiming self-defense if he or she is at any point the aggressor or provocateur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governor Scott has told the news media he's open to changing the law, enacted in 2005. &quot;If there's something wrong with the law that's in place, I think it's important we address it,&quot; he said. &quot;If what's happening is it's being abused, that's not right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Stand Your Ground law took effect in Florida, the number of killings found to be justifiable homicide has jumped there. The annual number of such cases has gone from 13 a year on average before 2005 to an average of 36 a year after the law took effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, a jump in the number of justifiable homicides coincides with the adoption of Florida-like laws, which are backed by the NRA, in about half of the states. There were 238 justifiable homicides in the US in 2006, compared with 278 in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law's defenders say Stand Your Ground is intended, after all, to make people freer to defend themselves in public, so the increased claims of self-defense are an understandable, even desirable, outcome. What's more, Florida's violent crime rate dropped by nearly 7 percent both in 2009 and 2010, year over year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of these laws, however, say the leap in justifiable homicides proves that Stand Your Ground is a flawed strategy that has led to unintended consequences, including needless deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No controversy surrounding these laws has been bigger than the death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26. Concern about the handling of his case has gradually evolved into widespread outrage, resulting in a massive Internet petition for the arrest of the shooter as well as major protests, including in Miami and New York, over perceived racial injustice. When he was shot, Trayvon, a high school basketball player and aspiring aviation mechanic, was on his way back to his father's fiance&eacute;'s house in the gated Retreat at Twin Lakes community, after buying Skittles and an iced tea at a convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as the law comes under scrutiny, Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee on Thursday stepped aside temporarily under mounting pressure over his department's handling of Trayvon's death. He had defended his department's decision to not arrest the shooter, a part-Hispanic man named George Zimmerman, who claimed self-defense. Police cited the Stand Your Ground law in declining to charge Mr. Zimmerman, who has an arrest record and who had lately made dozens of 911 calls to police to complain about suspicious individuals in the neighborhood. Police also did not test Zimmerman for alcohol or drug use before releasing him on the night of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Lee received a vote of no-confidence from the Sanford City Council on Wednesday. Some suggest the problem in the Martin case may not be with the law itself, but rather with the Sanford P.D.'s interpretation of it. The Stand Your Ground law, they say, does not guarantee a right to confront somebody and then claim self-defense if a shooting ensues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's interesting to speculate about how the police culture was incorporating [information about the law] into their activities, and maybe that is the point of friction and difficulty,&quot; says Nicholas Johnson, a law professor at Fordham University. &quot;I'm sure that the people reevaluating the law will be wondering and thinking about whether it's a question of communication about what the law says versus a need for shift in the law [itself].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case shot into the national spotlight last week after Trayvon's parents and their lawyers blasted the police department for not arresting George Zimmerman. On tapes of Zimmerman's 911 calls to the police before the shooting, Zimmerman reported that a black male wearing a hoodie was acting suspicious. He then ignored a dispatcher's suggestion to stay put and pursued the teen on foot. A struggle ensued in which Trayvon was killed and Zimmerman received cuts on his nose and on the back of his head. Zimmerman told police he was retreating to his truck when he was attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heeding a growing uproar on the perception of racial injustice - what if the shooter had been black and the victim white? - the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the FBI, and the US Justice Department's Civil Rights Division are all investigating the case. Zimmerman, meanwhile, is in hiding, though his father, Robert Zimmerman, has defended his son, saying he wasn't acting on prejudice and did not initiate the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems to me there's something of a failure of a local prosecutor and law enforcement, including the fact that Zimmerman wasn't tested for drugs or intoxicants,&quot; says Bob Cottrol, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University. &quot;It seems a fair stretch in terms of using the no-duty-to-retreat law as a defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Stand Your Ground law in Florida has been invoked in a number of questionable cases, critics say. It has been used in the case of a gang member who shot and killed a 15-year-old and successfully argued self-defense, and in a case last year in which a repo man wasn't charged after shooting and killing a man trying to stop him from repossessing a car. But in 2007, the courts did question self-defense claims in the case of a homeowner who shot, but did not kill, a man from behind as the man walked away from the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are lots of instances where people end up making successful self-defense claims where there's preliminary back and forth - a fight starts, there's retreat and pursuit - and that are typical of the set of problems that one has to unwind in self-defense cases,&quot; says Fordham's Professor Johnson. &quot;But pursuit is two steps away from retreat, and that complicates Zimmerman's claim of self-defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research is inconclusive concerning the safety effects of laws that allow wider latitude for citizens to carry and use guns. But the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case is highlighting for some legislators the possibility that the self-defense doctrine, intermingled with thorny issues of American life such as race and vigilantism, can lead to unnecessary bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing's ever finished in the legislature, I learned that. Everything can always be readdressed,&quot; state Rep. Dennis Baxley, a co-author of the 2005 law, told CBS News. &quot;We need to look at the circumstances that occurred and see if some kind of legislation is in order.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">734 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is pointing to the important role that that black community has played - both through news outlets and social media - in keeping his death in the public eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several prominent black journalists have been crucial in raising awareness of the killing of the unarmed 17-year-old by a neighborhood watch captain, some experts say. Moreover, influential rappers and actors have used Twitter and other avenues to stoke wider outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort shows how the black community is adapting to use new technologies and opportunities to bring their concerns before the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Najee Ali, a Los Angeles-based activist and director of Project Islamic H.O.P.E., says the issue was brought to his attention by the tweets of black celebrities such as Richard Simmons, Spike Lee, and clerics such as the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Black people were not even aware that [Martin] had been shot and killed until Rev. Al Sharpton and other black celebrities started posting it on social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee has tweeted: &quot;America The Beautiful,A Country Where A Black Teenager Can Be Shot And Killed Coming From A 7-Eleven Buying A Ice Tea And A Bag Of Skittles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black actress Gabrielle Union has also used Twitter to express her anger: &quot;#TrayvonMartin case has exposed some ppl as monsters...not just Zimmerman but ANY1 who makes excuses 4 a man who kills an unarmed child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As more blacks - like members of all ethnic groups - gravitate to Twitter, the social-media platform is gaining a greater ability to shape national causes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As in our previous research on Twitter use, African Americans and Latinos continue to have high rates of adoption of the service,&quot; according to a Pew Research Center study from 2011. &quot;Fully 25 percent of online African Americans use Twitter at least occasionally, with 11 percent doing so on a typical day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the black community's response to the Martin killing has not been only a social-media story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artist Jasiri X, an indie rapper from Pittsburgh, went viral with a rap song ending with the words, &quot;the message is only white life is protected in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black journalists have also played a crucial role, says Maurice Hall, chair of the communication department at Villanova University in Philadelphia. He cites four in particular: Trymaine Lee at the Huffington Post; Charles Blow of The New York Times; Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post; and Tulane University professor Melissa Harris-Perry, who has appeared on MSNBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He goes so far as to say that the efforts of these journalists have contributed to the US Justice Department opening an investigation Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are very prominent mainstream journalists that argued that the case needs to be looked at more closely,&quot; says Professor Hall. &quot;So you had the combination of online and mainstream media that really kept pushing this story in important ways. You can't pin it to any one thing, of course, but in my observation it is very clear that if it weren't for these prominent black journalists, this story wouldn't have been kept in the media and produced the pressure on federal law enforcement to respond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others agree that the rallying of the black community together in support of Martin played a crucial role in keeping the topic front and center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would say in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, if it weren't for the black voices taking to the streets and getting visits from the attorneys and staying involved, that the wider media would not have thought this newsworthy,&quot; says Donald Tibbs, a professor at Drexel University's Earle Mack School of Law in Philadelphia and author of &quot;From Black Power to Prison Power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martin case is a perfect example of the influence of the black community on national media coverage, says Derede McAlpin, vice president of Levick Strategic Communications in Washington. She says it parallels the case of the Jena Six of 2006, in which six black teens were arrested for serious offenses while their non-minority counterparts received different treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The [Jena Six] case was largely ignored by the US national media. The Town Talk and The Jena Times covered the story from its inception,&quot; says Ms. McAlpin. &quot;But the case didn't reach a national level until African-American bloggers and [black] media reported on the issue, which resulted in the mobilization of a nationwide network of supporters, civil rights activists, and community groups.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE PARENTS OF the unarmed black Florida teenager slain three weeks ago by a neighborhood watchman joined a &quot;million hoodie&quot; march in Union Square Wednesday demanding the shooter's arrest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our son is your son,&quot; Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's mom Sybrina Fulton told a big crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a black and white thing. This is a right and wrong thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators burst into a chant of &quot;Justice for Trayvon!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As national anger over the shooting grows, MSNBC host and civil-rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton planned a rally Thursday in Sanford, Fla., the Orlando suburb where the 17-year-old was killed Feb. 26 by 28-year-old George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents were in New York for a blizzard of TV appearances campaigning for Zimmerman's arrest and the resignation of the Sanford police chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facing a rising tide of criticism, Sanford city commissioners voted, 3 to 2, on Wednesday that they had no confidence in Police Chief Bill Lee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Wednesday, the Sanford city manager put out a letter saying the cops could not arrest Zimmerman because of Florida's controversial 2005 Stand Your Ground law, which allows people to shoot anyone they believe is threatening them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Law enforcement was PROHIBITED from making an arrest,&quot; City Manager Norton Bonaparte wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican lawmakers who wrote the Stand Your Ground law disputed that, saying Zimmerman went looking for a confrontation and should therefore be arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has no protection under my law,&quot; former state Sen. Durell Peaden told the Miami Herald.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, who was staying at his dad's house in the gated community, went to 7-Eleven to buy Skittles and iced tea wearing a hoodie on the drizzly night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, whose family says he is Hispanic, spotted Trayvon and called 911 - one of dozens of calls over the years about suspicious black males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy looks like he's up to no good. . . . These a**holes always get away,&quot; Zimmerman told the police dispatcher before following the teenager</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- even though he was told to stay put.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When cops arrived, Trayvon was dead, shot in the chest by Zimmerman, who had a bloody nose and claimed the teenager jumped him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Chief Lee insisted there was no probable cause to arrest Zimmerman, either at the scene or after it emerged that calls to 911 from worried neighbors captured the teen's desperate cries for help and a single gunshot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 70 years later it's clear not everybody got that memo.

Zimmerman, who is Latino, called the emergency services because he thought Martin, 17, looked &quot;suspicious&quot; and then, against the advice of the dispatcher, followed him. The two men fought. Martin died. Zimmerman emerged, bleeding from the nose and the back of his head, claiming he shot Martin in self-defence because he was in fear of his life. </SPAN></P>

Under Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; statute, deadly force is permitted if the person &quot;reasonably believes&quot; it is necessary to protect their own life, the life of another or to prevent a forcible felony. Zimmerman weighs 250lbs and had a 9mm handgun; Martin weighed 140lbs and had a packet of Skittles and a can of iced tea. Being a young black male, it seems, is reason enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One can only speculate as to Zimmerman's intentions. Efforts to create a crude morality play around this shooting in which Martin is sanctified and Zimmerman is pathologised miss the point. Zimmerman's assumptions on seeing Martin may have been reprehensible but they were not illogical. Black men in America are more likely to be stopped, searched, arrested, convicted and executed than any other group. With almost one in 10 black men behind bars there are more of them in prison, on probation or on parole today than were enslaved in 1850. To assume that when you see a black man you see a criminal is rooted in the fact that black men have been systematically criminalised. That excuses nothing but explains a great deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Add to this lax gun laws, entrenched segregation, deep economic inequalities and a statute that endorses vigilantism, and a murder of this kind is inevitable. Indeed what makes Martin's case noteworthy is not that it happened but that it has sparked such widespread indignation beyond his immediate community. It is not at all uncommon for young black men to leave the world in a shower of bullets followed by deafening silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight kids under the age of 19 are killed by guns in America every day. While researching the stories of those who fell one November day in 2006 I ran across the story of Brandon Moore. Brandon was 16 when he was shot in the back in the middle of the afternoon by an off-duty cop moonlighting as a security guard in Detroit. The guard had previously shot a man dead during a neighbourhood fracas, shot his wife (though not fatally) in a domestic dispute and had been involved in a fatal hit-and-run car accident while under the influence of alcohol. Brandon's death was dismissed in the city's two main newspapers in less than 200 words. It was ruled to be justifiable homicide. A year later the guard was still in the police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're deemed not reportable,&quot; said Clementina Chery, who runs the Boston-based Louis D Brown Peace Institute, which assists families in the immediate aftermath of shootings and works in schools to educate people about gun violence. &quot;Black children are dispensable. Violence is expected to happen in these communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to the escalating outrage at Martin's death an investigation has now been launched by the US department of justice, and the state attorney's office will be sending it to a grand jury. It took three weeks, outrage and the mobilisation of thousands of people to make that happen. Apparently the facts alone did not warrant further inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question now is whether Martin's case can gain the attention at the highest levels. In 2009 when a well known African American Harvard professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr, was arrested while trying to get into his own home, Obama made his views known in a clumsy intervention that ended in him staging a &quot;beer summit&quot; with Gates and the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given how rarely Obama refers to issues of race and how much there is to refer to, it was strange that he would spend his considerable moral capital in this area to defend a tenured Harvard professor whom he knew, and who was detained for a few hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll never know if Martin could have become a Harvard professor. But it would be nice to think that his short life and brutal death would receive the same kind of presidential attention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds attend 'Million Hoodie March' in outrage over Florida teen's killing, but crowd turned rowdy as night progressed <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parents of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the Florida teenager whose shooting death last month has sparked international outrage, described their heartache to a crowd of well over a thousand people at a New York City rally held in their son's honor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My son did not deserve to die,&quot; said Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother told the mass of supporters gathered in Union Square early in the evening on Wednesday. &quot;Our son is your son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My heart is in pain,&quot; she added. The crowd responded to Fulton with a chant, &quot;You are not alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seeing the support from all of you really makes a difference,&quot; Fulton went on to say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Trayvon had been alive he would be right here on these steps with you guys rallying for justice,&quot; Tracy Martin, Trayvon's father, added. &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is you. Trayvon Martin did matter. And I just want New York to know that we're not going to stop until we get justice for Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dubbed the Million Hoodie March, the demonstration was called in response to the controversial killing of the unarmed, 17 year-old African American by Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was carrying a bag of Skittles and a can of iced tea at the time of his death and wore a hooded sweatshirt. Zimmerman has not been arrested in the incident, though the US justice department has launched an investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of Martin's family have blamed the Sanford police department for failing to investigate the teen's death properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not about George Zimmerman,&quot; said Raphael Nelson, an attendee at Wednesday's demonstration. &quot;It's about the fact the police came, they saw a dead boy on the floor and they left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's death has sparked a national outcry, resulted in a petition for Zimmerman's prosecution that has gained nearly 1m signatures and renewed conversations of racial justice in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The darker your skin, the more you look like a criminal,&quot; New York City councilman Jumaane Williams told the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Florida. It's Ramarley Graham in the Bronx,&quot; he added, referring to an unarmed African American teen shot to death in his bathroom by a New York City police officer in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday's rally saw scores of families, many African American, fill some of Manhattan's most major streets. Parents pushed strollers and many demonstrators carried bags of Skittles and cans of iced tea. At times demonstrators chanted, &quot;Don't shoot me, don't kill me, for Skittles and iced tea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stop killing innocent black men and we won't have to do this,&quot; one young woman yelled to police following the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the night progressed demonstrators splintered into several marches numbering in the hundreds, taking off in different directions throughout the city. The crowds were fused with Occupy Wall Street protesters who were cleared from Union Square just one day before the rally took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A contingent of demonstrators made their way to Times Square while another headed south into the financial district. The southbound march grew increasingly raucous as it carried on into the night. One young man was seen running over the hood and roof of a moving car as it slowly approached the march. He stepped on the sun-roof of the vehicle, shattering the glass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after, the march, then reduced to approximately 200, arrived at the iconic Wall Street bull statue at Bowling Green Park. Since Occupy Wall Street protests began last year, the sculpture has been penned in by police barricades. As demonstrators surrounded the bull, a young man began pulling a section of the barricades down. As the police moved in his direction, other demonstrators followed suit and within moments all of the barricades were removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man quickly scrambled onto the back on the bronze statue, raised his fist and yelled, &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some argued Wednesday's later marches became unfocused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bull has nothing to do with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; said Occupy protester Stan Williams. &quot;I think the people leading the march may have lost focus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By approximately 10pm, the various marches began to reconvene in Union Square. The atmosphere took a distinctly more Occupy-focused turn as several hundred people gathered in the square, talking and celebrating. Scores of police filled the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before midnight the parks department announced the park would be closed and asked the crowd to leave. The scene grew tense and many expected a potentially violent confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At midnight a senior New York City police officer announced, &quot;You are occupying the space unlawfully,&quot; and ordered the crowd to leave. Moments after midnight struck a glass bottle was hurled in the direction of the police and parks department officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of police officers in column formation methodically made their way into the square's plaza, as the demonstrators willingly moved to the sidewalk surrounding the park and a second glass bottle was thrown at police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barricades were erected around the perimeter of the square's well-known plaza. Roughly 200 demonstrators remained on the pavement into the wee hours of the morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many who attended the rally, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death represented long-standing fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon could've been my little brother,&quot; said KC, who declined to give her last name as she marched through lower Manhattan. &quot;Shot for nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked if she believed Zimmerman would be prosecuted, KC hesitated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know,&quot; she said. &quot;We live in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Lee's announcement that he will stand aside for now comes as anger builds over failure to arrest George Zimmerman <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida police chief in charge of the investigation into the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin has stepped down from his post &quot;temporarily&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Lee's announcement came after a vote of no confidence in the Sanford police department by the city commission, and follows demands from civil rights leaders that he resign over the handling of Martin's killing. Nearly a month after Martin's death, no arrests have been made, despite George Zimmerman - who claimed he acted in self-defence - admitting to the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a brief press conference in Sanford on Thursday afternoon, Lee said that his presence had become a &quot;distraction from the investigation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore, I have come to the decision that I must temporarily relieve myself from the position as police chief for the city of Sanford,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His announcement was greeted with applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norton Bonaparte, Sanford's city manager, said steps were being taken to ensure justice will prevail.&quot;What the city wants more than anything for the family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee's announcement came as the local authorities released new information about the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial police report of the scene, published along with other documents by the Sanford city council on Thursday, records that Zimmerman, Martin's killer, was bleeding from the back of the head and nose. Police noted at the time Zimmerman's back was wet and covered in grass, as if he had been lying on his back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The self-styled neighbourhood watch volunteer shot and killed the unarmed 17-year-old on February 26 as he returned to the home of his father's girlfriend after a trip to the local convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 28, cited Florida's controversial &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which authorises the use of lethal force in certain situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the police report, one of the first police officers who was on the scene handcuffed Zimmerman and removed his gun, a Kel Tek 9mm PF9 semi-automatic handgun and holster. The officer noted: &quot;While I was in such close contact with Zimmerman, I could observe that his back appeared to be wet and was covered with grass, as if he had been laying on his back on the ground. Zimmerman was also bleeding from the nose and the back of his head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the critics of the police investigation are two witnesses who say they saw Zimmerman straddle Martin the night he was shot. Mary Cutcher and her roommate, Selma Mora Lamilla, told CNN that despite repeated calls to police, they have not been interviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key to any prosecution of Zimmerman, according to lawyers, will be forensic evidence. However, although the police report says police tape was put up and a crime scene contamination log taken after the shooting, doubts remain over whether officers have properly secured any forensic evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions have already been raised about the failure to carry out drug and alcohol tests on Zimmerman, although they were done on Martin after his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, lawyer for the Martin family, told the Guardian: &quot;We're not aware of any forensics that were done at the scene. In fact, we know that he [Zimmerman] left with the clothes that were certainly evidence on his body after being questioned for about two hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we know first-hand that this was not a thorough investigation from the beginning. They didn't even do a background check on the shooter - but they did a background check on Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the dead black kid on the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump did not know whether a post-mortem had been done on Martin. He was not aware of any drugs or alcohol being found in Martin's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We haven't seen any evidence of that other than hearsay,&quot; Crump said. &quot;However, I would say this: if there was an altercation we know that Zimmerman started it because he ignored the police instructions and pursued him [Martin] even though they told him not to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that he had three independent witnesses who contradicted Zimmerman's account of crying out for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was the kid crying for help, and, furthermore, you can hear with your own ears - it doesn't sound like Zimmerman at all. And everyone says that was Trayvon's voice calling out for help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports have also emerged that the patrol sergeant, Anthony Raimondo, in charge of the scene the night of Martin's shooting, was involved in another controversial case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justin Collinson, the son of a police officer, attacked a homeless man in 2010, but was not immediately arrested, even when a video emerged, according to WFTV. The station reported that Raimondo was the officer in charge the night of the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When contacted by the Guardian about this report, Sanford police department were unavailable for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As public confidence in the local police approached rock bottom, the focus is shifting towards the investigations by the US justice department's civil rights department and the state attorney in Seminole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers at the justice department have said that it would be a difficult case to prosecute under federal law. Civil rights law protects against &quot;hate crimes&quot; or actions by police officers, but officials speaking anonymously to the Washington Post said Martin's shooting may not have either of those elements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury, however, called by the state attorney, has the power to indict Zimmerman and lawyers expect that to happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The architects of Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law have said Martin's killer should probably be arrested and does not deserve immunity under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence attorney explains how lack of forensic evidence would complicate potential prosecution of George Zimmerman <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida prosecutors face significant hurdles building a case against the man who killed Trayvon Martin, a legal expert has told the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University and a defence attorney, said the case had several &quot;murky&quot; elements which are likely to prove difficult for the prosecution, including within the 911 tape which appears to suggest Zimmerman was the one in pursuit of Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turley said the evidence was not nearly as conclusive of guilt as many people have assumed. &quot;Some parts of the 911 tape would work to the disadvantage of Zimmerman, others to his advantage,&quot; he said. &quot;It would be a very difficult case for the prosecution without more evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;We haven't seen any of the forensic evidence, which is the key.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turley, who has written a blog about the case exploring the 911 tape, said it included elements in Zimmerman's favour:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has him ignoring requests not to follow Martin but it includes a portion where he is saying that Martin is approaching him. We have heard reports that Zimmerman was bleeding as the result of a struggle. Zimmerman was a big individual and was armed. It's difficult to believe because of his size and the fact that he was armed that he felt in imminent threat of death. But lawyers could point to the tape showing that Zimmerman believed Martin might be armed. That Martin was moving towards him and checking him out. All of that is likely to be playing to a jury with the question of intend and whether he had a reasonable fear of serious injury or death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point in the tape, Zimmerman refers to Martin's hand in his waistband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turley believes that the case is going to turn on classic criminal defence elements under common law, where an individual is allowed to use lethal force if they fear injury or death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You lose that defence if you are the aggressor or if you do not have a reasonable basis for fear or serious harm or death. Even if he is not the aggressor there will remain the question of escalation or confrontation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key difficulty, said Turley, is the &quot;maddening gap&quot; of evidence at the critical time of confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At what point does a physical struggle justify the use of lethal force? If I was the defence counsel in the case, the first thing I would do is the trajectory of the bullet, how close it was to Martin, where it was fired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turley said the racial element is unclear. In the 911 tape, Zimmerman says &quot;He looks black&quot; and then says &quot;he's a black male&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Zimmerman family have denied any racial element. On the tape he initially appears not to know the race, but then later does. All of these elements are murky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Turley believes there was enough evidence to arrest Zimmerman and to secure an indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police would have been on solid grounds to arrest him. You have an unarmed teenager and someone who does not comply with a request that he not follow Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That doesn't mean there's enough evidence to secure a conviction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even under Florida's Stand Your Ground law, Turley said, Zimmerman, if indicted, would still have to demonstrate he had a reasonable fear of death or serious injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 22--Kansas has a &quot;stand your ground law&quot; very similar to one in Florida, which is being cited in defense of a neighborhood watch captain who last week shot to death an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, both in Kansas and Florida, says a citizen doesn't have to retreat before using deadly force if in fear of death or imminent harm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida has had such a law since 2005. Kansas lawmakers adopted the provision in its self-defense statutes in 2010, expanding on a law that long allowed Kansans to use deadly force in protecting their property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Sanford, Fla., said 28-year-old George Zimmerman says he shot Trayvon Martin, 17, in self-defense during a confrontation in a gated community. Police did not arrest Zimmerman after the shooting, but the State Attorney announced Tuesday the case will go before a county grand jury, according to Associated Press stories about the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News reports indicate Martin was walking through the neighborhood when Zimmerman spotted him and began to follow him as he called police to report the suspicious man in the neighborhood. 911 recordings indicate Zimmerman was instructed by police not to follow Martin, but he did and then confronted Martin when Martin pulled out a cell phone to call his girlfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can use deadly force in Kansas if you believe it is reasonably necessary,&quot; said Reno County District Attorney Keith Schroeder. &quot;There are two standards that are applied in Kansas in any type of situation like that: one objective, the other subjective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the objective, prosecutors look at the facts &quot;from a reasonable person-type vantage point,&quot; Schroeder said. &quot;How would a reasonable person, given this situation, have reacted?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And did someone put themselves in that situation or did they find themselves in it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subjective view looks at what the person involved believed at the time, Schroeder said, and whether &quot;there are facts that support or justify this person in the acts they took from their personal perspective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, Schroeder said, were there prior instances in the neighborhood of break-ins or violence at the time of night the incident occurred, and whether the person killed matched the description of a suspect or how suspicious their behavior was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The person might be justified in shooting if he believed the person was pulling a weapon -- rather than a cell phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, Schroeder said, even though police had been called, &quot;I would want to know if police had been called before, and how long it took them to respond. Had he had something happen before? We might assume police would arrive in a few minutes, but was the closest officer to respond 30 minutes or longer away? It all has to be fact driven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kansas has had a &quot;stand your ground law&quot; for many years if an incident was on the shooters property, Schroeder said. The change in the law for all cases of self-defense has not resulted in any significant change in behavior, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that reason, the Florida incident doesn't give him much cause for concern in relations to law in Kansas, Schroeder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look at the statistics, you'll probably discover this would be an aberration,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a possibility, but statistically it doesn't cause me concern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorneys in the Reno County Public Defender's office said no such cases have arisen in Kansas, so the law remains new territory. Professors at the Washburn and University of Kansas schools of law were on spring break this week and unavailable to comment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 22--So far, Kansas has been fortunate to avoid an incident similar to the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that case, 28-year-old George Zimmerman followed an unarmed Martin, whom he described as &quot;suspicious,&quot; through Zimmerman's gated community. Despite assurances from 911 officials that the police had been dispatched, Zimmerman continued his pursuit. The two got into a dispute after Martin removed his cell phone from his pocket, and Zimmerman fired a fatal shot into Martin's chest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And thanks to Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, Zimmerman so far hasn't been arrested or charged in the incident, although the case will be reviewed by a Florida grand jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kansas law is similar to Florida's, stating that any person has the right to stand his ground at any place he has a right to be. Before legislators altered the law in 2010, it contained a &quot;duty to retreat&quot; provision, which required an initial attempt to leave a volatile situation before resorting to deadly force -- with an exception for a person's private property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local officials view Florida's case as a rarity and express little concern about the implications of Kansas law. Nevertheless, Kansas would do well to re-evaluate its own law to prevent a similar tragedy here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right to stand one's ground shouldn't extend to the right to pursue someone who hasn't committed a crime, nor should it give people the right to initiate a confrontation and hide behind the law to avoid prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's death in Florida was inexcusable and completely unnecessary, and it was caused in part by a flawed law that allows people to determine what ground is theirs and a subjective interpretation of what is legally a legitimate threat.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vigilante who shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager whose killing has sparked outrage, had called police to the gated community where he lives 46 times in the previous year, it emerged yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch leader and gun enthusiast with a chequered past, repeatedly called emergency services when he spotted people he thought &quot;suspicious&quot; at The Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford, Florida. He was particularly worried about African-American youths wandering in the grounds. Recordings of six of Mr Zimmerman's most recent calls were released by the sheriff's office; in four of them, the &quot;suspect&quot; was a black male.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 26 February, Mr Zimmerman, 28, approached Trayvon, 17, who was wearing a hoodie as he walked to the Twin Lakes home of his father's girlfriend, having visited a 7-Eleven store. After a brief confrontation, the teenager was shot. He was found dead, unarmed, with a bag of Skittles and an iced tea. Police did not arrest Mr Zimmerman, apparently accepting his claim that he acted in self-defence. The US Justice Department has asked the FBI and civil rights department to review the case. A grand jury is also investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a million people have signed a petition calling for Mr Zimmerman to be charged with murder. Trayvon's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, were expected to attend a rally in his memory - called the Million Hoodie March - in Union Square, New York City, last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights activists have already held demonstrations across Florida, noting that Trayvon's death followed two other incidents in which Sanford police were accused of failing properly to investigate attacks on black men by white suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public pressure intensified as more became known about the background of Mr Zimmerman, who is in hiding with his family after death threats. Unlike Trayvon, who had no criminal record, Mr Zimmerman has had several run-ins with the law. In 2005, he was arrested for allegedly assaulting a police officer at a bar. Later that year, he was accused of domestic violence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Justice Department has opened an investigation into the fatal shooting last month of an unarmed black Florida teenager by a crime-watch volunteer, a case that has set off a national outcry. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven years after Florida adopted a sweeping self-defense law, the shooting of an unarmed black teenager has put that law at the center of an increasingly vocal debate over how he was killed and whether law enforcement officials have the authority to charge the man who killed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, called Stand Your Ground, is one of 21 self-defense laws in the United States, many of which were enacted in the past few years. The National Rifle Association, a major advocate for gun rights in the United States, had pushed heavily for the Florida law, while law enforcement officers had vigorously opposed it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Stand Your Ground law gives the benefit of the doubt to a person who claims to have killed in self-defense, regardless of whether the killing took place on a street, in a car or in a bar. In more restrictive laws, the standard for self-defense is generally for a killing to take place in one's home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, if people feel they are in imminent danger of being killed or badly wounded, they do not have to retreat, even if it would seem reasonable to do so. Instead, they have the right to ''stand their ground'' and to protect themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the question at issue in the present case: Was the gunman, George Zimmerman, 28, a crime watch volunteer in Sanford, Florida, in imminent danger and acting in self-defense during his encounter with the 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, as he asserts?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the three weeks since Trayvon, a high school student from Miami with no criminal record, was killed, public protests across Florida and the United States have grown larger and louder, and so have calls for Mr. Zimmerman's arrest. The Police Department in Sanford said that under the Stand Your Ground law in Florida, it had no call to act against Mr. Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But late Monday, the U.S. Department of Justice said it had opened an inquiry into the shooting. That investigation will run parallel with one announced Tuesday by the state attorney in Seminole County, Florida, who said a grand jury would be convened. State attorneys often use grand juries in cases where they cannot make a clear independent call, or when a case is deemed explosive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, Trayvon's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, have issued pleas for law enforcement officers to take action, and social media campaigns, led by the advocacy Web site change.org, have pushed for the U.S. justice system to act. Celebrities including the actor and director Spike Lee and the singer John Legend have joined the effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, a well-known civil rights advocate who has said he will attend a rally in Sanford this week, said he was planning to raise awareness about the Florida law, which he characterized as encouraging vigilante justice. ''People can't take the law in their own hands,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday evening in Sanford, hundreds of people gathered at the Allen Chapel A.M.E. Church as community leaders and residents gave testimonials of police harassment and as representatives of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People criticize the Stand Your Ground law. The spirited crowd called for the arrest of Mr. Zimmerman and the ouster of Sanford's police chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The line has been drawn in the sand,'' said Turner Clayton, head of the Seminole County N.A.A.C.P. office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Trayvon's parents, said at a news conference Tuesday that Trayvon had been speaking to his girlfriend on his cellphone minutes before he was shot and killed, and that Trayvon had told her that a man was following him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon then told his girlfriend that he was being confronted, Mr. Crump said, and when she told him to run, he said he would ''walk fast.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was headed at the time to the home of his father's girlfriend after going to a convenience store, and he was carrying Skittles candy and a can of iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Why are you following me?'' Mr. Crump said Trayvon had asked. The girlfriend then heard a faraway voice ask, ''What are you doing around here?'' Mr. Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's voice then fell away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''She completely blows Zimmerman's self-defense claim out of the water,'' Mr. Crump said of the girlfriend's description of the conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman had reported a ''suspicious'' person to emergency services shortly before the encounter, saying a black male had been checking out the houses in the area and had been staring at him. Mr. Zimmerman, who had studied criminal justice, often patrolled the neighborhood. He had placed 46 calls to the 911 emergency call system in 14 months, for reports including open windows and suspicious persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his call to 911 on Feb. 26, Mr. Zimmerman, using an expletive and speaking of Trayvon, said they ''always get away.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 911 dispatcher told Mr. Zimmerman not to get out of his car and said that police officers were on their way. But Mr. Zimmerman was already outside and a dispute began. He told the police that Trayvon had attacked him and that he had fired in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents say that they are sure they can hear Trayvon pleading for his life on the recording of the call to 911. Several witnesses who heard the encounter agree it was Trayvon who was screaming, but Mr. Zimmerman told the police that it was his own voice they heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police said they had found no evidence to dispute Mr. Zimmerman's claim of self-defense. Without that, the Stand Your Ground law makes it hard to make an arrest, and for prosecutors to charge and bring to trial. The state attorney is now in charge of the case and is being assisted by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about the law at a news conference Tuesday, Governor Rick Scott of Florida said that he did not think the law was unfair but that it merited a close look. ''Anytime we see something like that, we have to review and make sure we're not giving people the opportunity to use the law unfairly,'' he said. ''You want to do everything you can to make sure this doesn't happen again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors in Florida say that the number of defendants who claim self-defense had increased noticeably since the Stand Your Ground law was passed in 2005. It has been used judiciously and fairly in many cases, when self-defense was clear, but other cases have left prosecutors scratching their heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Self-defense is now used more widely than it was under the old law,'' said William Eddins, the state attorney in Pensacola, Florida, and president of the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It is a very broad law in terms of the availability of the defendant to try to take advantage of this law,'' Mr. Eddins said. ''It has created more litigation for the state in cases involving violence and in murder cases, in particular.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law also prevents a person shooting in self-defense from being sued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willie Meggs, the state attorney in Tallahassee, Florida, who fought the law when it was proposed, said: ''The consequences of the law have been devastating around the state. It's almost insane what we are having to deal with.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is increasingly used by gang members fighting gang members, drug dealers battling drug dealers and people involved in road rage encounters. Claims of self-defense are also common during confrontations at a bar, when someone looks at another person the wrong way or bothers someone's girlfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the old law, a person being threatened with a gun or a knife had a duty to try to get away from the situation, if possible. Now that person has a right to grab a gun (or knife, or ice pick, as happened in one case) and use it, without an attempt to retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Meggs said he had lost a case on appeal that was clearly not a shooting in self-defense. The defendant, who was in a car, could have driven away. The man who was shot was unarmed but had angered the defendant earlier in the night, and then he had leaned into the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It happens with rival gangs, too. ''It puts us in a posture that, if you and I had words, and I said get your gun and I will meet you on the street, we can have a shootout in the street and the winner is standing his ground,'' Mr. Meggs said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigating the cases, prosecutors say, is time-consuming. ''You have to be very careful and very thorough,'' Mr. Eddins said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless there are reliable witnesses and clear-cut physical evidence, the self-defense homicide cases are often murky and hard to sort out, prosecutors say. The gunman's side of the story usually prevails because the person who was shot is not alive to challenge the claim. So rather than let a jury decide a self-defense case, which is mostly what happened under the old law, prosecutors sometimes drop it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The person who is alive always says, 'I was in fear that he was going to hurt me,''' Mr. Meggs said. ''And the other person would say, 'I wasn't going to hurt anyone.' But he is dead. That is the problem they are wrestling with in Sanford.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 22--RICHARDSON, Texas And Dallas, Texas -- Several neighborhood watch groups in North Texas want to reassure residents their volunteer security officers are not practicing under the same apparent order as the neighborhood watch volunteer who police say shot and killed Trayvon Martin. George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old watch commander, shot and killed Martin in February. Martin, a 17-year-old, who was walking on his way back to his father's fiance's house, had just left a nearby convenient store. ZImmerman called 911 when he saw the teen, saying he was &quot;black,&quot; &quot;looks suspicious,&quot; and was wearing a hoodie. Though the dispatcher advised against following the teen, and told Zimmerman police were on the way, Zimmerman, police say, pursued Martin, who was on the phone with his girlfriend at the time. Zimmerman shot and killed Martin. He told police it was because Martin attacked him. Police found no weapon on the teen, who was about 100 pounds lighter than Zimmerman, and had change, a pack of candy and a can of ice tea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorneys like former Dallas County Prosecutor Dennis Fuller say there are some restrictions in Texas as to when you can defend yourself and there are certainly limitations on when you can use deadly force to defend yourself.  Assuming the other party is using or threatening to use force against you, a possible prosecutor's question, in a case like this, would be whether the actor reasonably believed deadly force was immediately necessary to protect himself from deadly force, or to prevent a violent crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fuller adds, &quot;This is being characterized as a self defense case. The prosecutor and the judge both get to evaluate: Was it reasonable for him to be in such fear that he had to use deadly force? We have a couple of statutes that allow folks to use deadly force to protect themselves and their property. In Texas, the question would be relatively the same. Anyone that's been through concealed handgun training in Texas knows that you don't go lookin' for trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, certified concealed weapons training instructors like Doug Reeves of Richardson's Lincoln American Concealed Handgun Academy, say anyone who carries a fire arm should be properly trained and follow rules, guidelines and laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I was in that situation, I would have followed the young man around, keep my distance and notify police, and wait until police come and handle the situation. In Texas, someone has to be presenting deadly force against someone in order for that person to resort to deadly force,&quot; Reeves said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob McClure has been with Richardson's Richland Park Crime Watch Patrol for 15 of the neighborhood watch programs 18 successful years. Each of their volunteers receive training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McClure says, &quot;We don't carry any weapons, cause if I was to get out and somebody was to get out and something happen, I could get sued, the city could get sued. The name of the group is crime watch, and that's the key.--WATCH. We're the eyes and ears of police. We see something, hear something, we to call it in. I have 54 people on patrol that circulate. Our crime went down 60% that first year.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The disease is not a direct threat to humans but meat and milk from ill animals are unsafe for consumption. Some 40,222 cases of the disease are suspected in Egypt and 4,658 animals, mostly calves, have already died. The agency said 6.3 million buffalo and cattle and 7.5 million sheep and goats are at risk in Egypt.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors issue warrant for ex-MP ROMANIA: Prosecutors announced on Thursday that they will issue an international arrest warrant for a right-wing MP who fled the country before he was stripped of his parliamentary immunity over a property scam. They say Mihail Boldea of the Democratic Liberal Party was involved in falsifying title deeds while working as a lawyer. The houses were sold through intermediaries to make money. Mr Boldea left Romania on March 17, three days before parliament agreed the request to remove his immunity. Bereaved father vows justice fight UNITED STATES: The parents of a black teenager shot dead by a vigilante in Florida told hundreds of people at a New York march in his memory on Wednesday that they won't stop until they get justice for him. Neighbourhood watch captain George Zimmerman has not been charged for the February 26 shooting of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Sanford, Florida. Mr Martin's father Tracy Martin said: &quot;I've told myself when I get justice for Trayvon, then I'll have my time to break down.&quot; Sunni guard was tortured, say MPs IRAQ: Iraq National Movement (INM) MPs accused the Shi'ite-dominated government on Thursday of torturing to death a jailed bodyguard who worked for Vice-President Tariq al-Hashemi, Iraq's highest-ranking Sunni official. The guard was held on suspicion of terrorism. Authorities say he died of kidney failure on March 15. INM MP Salman al-Jumaili demanded an investigation and said that human rights organisations should look into the case. MPs angered by dodgy coal deal INDIA: Angry MPs blocked proceedings in parliament on Thursday in the wake of the leak of an audit report which found that the government has lost hundreds of billions of pounds by selling coalfields to companies without competitive bidding. Opposition party leaders demanded an explanation from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of why about 155 coalfields were sold to select private and state-run companies without competitive bidding, resulting in an estimated loss of nearly &pound;135bn. Mr Singh's government has been repeatedly embarrassed in recent years as senior ministers and officials have faced corruption charges. UN calls for halt to Syria bloodshed SYRIA: The United Nations security council sent a united message to the Syrian government and opposition on Wednesday to immediately implement proposals by international envoy Kofi Annan to end the year-long bloodshed. The presidential statement, which is non-binding, calls for a ceasefire, a daily two-hour halt to fighting to evacuate the injured and provide humanitarian aid and inclusive Syrian-led political talks &quot;to address the legitimate concerns of the Syrian people.&quot; The council condemned &quot;the terrorist attacks which happened in Damascus and Aleppo on March 17 and 18 and caused tens of deaths and injuries.&quot; North Korea gets orchestra invite UNITED STATES: An Atlanta-based humanitarian group announced on Thursday that it is planning to bring North Korea's national orchestra to the US this spring for a tour that aims to boost understanding between US and Korean citizens. Global Resource Services president Robert Springs said that the proposed 18-day visit by the North Korean National Symphony Orchestra is awaiting government approval. &quot;The hope is that we can better understand the people of North Korea and that they can better understand us,&quot; he said. &quot;And that could lead to normalised relations.&quot; 'Accidental' bomb blast kills driver INDIA: A bomb exploded on Thursday in a car outside Srinigar in Jammu Kashmir state, killing the driver and wounding at least 20 others in what police said may have been an accident involving separatists. Authorities believe a rebel was transporting the bomb when it went off accidentally in Bijbehara town.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI -- Facing mounting protests over the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager by a neighborhood watch volunteer, the Sanford City Commission voted on Wednesday that they had no confidence in the city's police chief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote of 3 to 2 came on a day when demonstrators, many wearing hoodies as Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, was when he was shot to death on Feb. 26, marched in New York City and Miami. The marchers demanded that the police arrest George Zimmerman, the watch volunteer in Sanford, a small city north of Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, 28, a white Hispanic, told the police that he shot Trayvon in self-defense after an altercation. The teenager was walking home from a convenience store, where he bought iced tea and Skittles, when he was shot once in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioners cannot fire the police chief, Bill Lee Jr., who reports to the city manager. Norton Bonaparte, the city manager, said he would take the no-confidence vote under advisement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Velma Williams, one of three city commissioners who voted no confidence at the three-hour special meeting, said afterward that she could not understand why the police had not made an arrest in the case. ''Ray Charles or Stevie Wonder can see through all of this,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Commissioner Randy Jones, who chose not to vote against the police chief, was not so sure, saying Chief Lee was welcoming a review of the department's handling of the shooting. ''The wheels of justice turn at 55 miles per hour, to make sure it's deliberate, that everything lines up,'' Mr. Jones said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Lee has served only 10 months leading a police department that has had a troubled relationship with blacks in Sanford. His predecessor, Brian Tooley, was forced out of the job after a scandal that involved a police lieutenant's son. The son attacked a homeless man in December 2010 but the police did not immediately arrest him after the episode, which was recorded on video. Even after being sent a video of the attack, Chief Tooley failed to act promptly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This came five years after two white security guards killed a black teenager. One of the guards was the son of a former Sanford police officer and the other was a volunteer in the department. The security guards claimed self-defense, saying that the black teenager tried to run them over. The teenager died from a gunshot wound in his back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judge dismissed the case over lack of evidence. The case inflamed passions in the town about the treatment of blacks by the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is one issue after another here between the Police Department and the black community,'' said Turner Clayton, president of the Seminole County branch of the N.A.A.C.P.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Justice and the state attorney in Seminole County have opened inquiries into the shooting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''A Florida Law Gets Scrutiny After a Killing'' (front page, March 21):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me see if I've got this straight: A self-appointed vigilante, brandishing a deadly weapon, reportedly ignores police directions and assaults an unarmed black 17-year-old, and as a result of this self-instigated confrontation the teenager is killed; the assailant pleads self-defense and may escape prosecution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surely this scenario cannot be justified under any sane reading of Florida's Stand Your Ground law. Florida's ill-conceived rejection of several hundred years of common-law precedent -- the duty to retreat safely rather than to resort to the use of deadly force -- has been revealed for its sheer idiocy. All such laws must be repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VAUGHN A. CARNEY Stowe, Vt., March 21, 2012</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer is a lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If citizens are to be entrusted with the responsibilities of gun ownership, they must be held accountable for their actions. Florida's Stand Your Ground self-defense law, along with the 20 similar laws across the country, effectively removes that accountability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem isn't just that feeling threatened is the only justification needed for the use of deadly force; it's that the courts must take the defendant's word on the matter. Without this law on the books, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the black teenager, might still be alive or, at the very least, we could rest assured that justice would prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But thanks to Stand Your Ground, George Zimmerman's claim that he felt threatened might be enough to keep him free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAM LEVINE New York, March 21, 2012</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''The Curious Case of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,'' by Charles M. Blow (column, March 17):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's death raises painful questions about race and the unfair burdens placed on African-American youths in our society. The tragedy also raises questions about the role of guns in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actions of the gunman, George Zimmerman, come amid a well-financed, nationwide effort by the National Rifle Association to reduce requirements for carrying concealed guns legally and to expand the legal definition of defensive gun use through ''shoot first'' legislation like that in place in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman was legally carrying the handgun he used to kill Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. It's time to ask if these laws are making America safer, or just setting us up for more tragic incidents and more senseless killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOE GRACE Philadelphia, March 19, 2012</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer is the former executive director of CeaseFirePA, a gun violence prevention organization in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles M. Blow's fears that his African-American sons may encounter a man with a gun are common among African-American fathers like me. We tutor our sons about the behaviors that may save their lives when they are not under our watchful eyes. In the 21st century, such tutoring should be passe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our youths have too long a history of victimization by law enforcement and their fellow citizens. Justice in these instances is too infrequent and too slow.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would have been tragic enough if the shooting of an unarmed teenager by a self-appointed neighborhood watch captain in Florida were the first to show the lethal folly of so-called Stand Your Ground laws. But, in fact, these outrageously dangerous laws have been adopted in many states, making it easy for shooters who kill to claim self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old student, was shot last month as he walked home one night with a snack in hand. His killing has stirred national outrageand protests because there is evidence he called out in alarm over his cellphone as the armed stranger closely pursued him. At the same time, George Zimmerman, the shooter, was on the phone with a police dispatcher, who told him, ''We don't need you to do that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, who got out of his car to pursue Mr. Martin, claimed a confrontation occurred that caused him to defend himself because he ''reasonably believed'' he would be harmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local police in Sanford, Fla., ruled the shooting justifiable under a law that was created to give the benefit of the doubt to people who shoot their guns in public areas and then claim self-defense. This statute goes well beyond the traditional principles of self-defense in homes. In 2005, Florida became the first in the nation to adopt this type of measure, with overwhelming bipartisan approval and the signature of Gov. Jeb Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Justice and state investigators have opened inquiries into the shooting, along with a county grand jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But citizens should not expect much help from lawmakers. A score of other states followed Florida's lead as politicians eagerly sought the gun lobby's favor. They threaten public safety by eliminating the longstanding legal requirement that someone sensing a threat has a reasonable ''duty to retreat'' from perceived danger before resorting to deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the enactment of the law, claims of justifiable homicide tripled in Florida, according to state data. ''It's almost insane what we are having to deal with,'' Willie Meggs, the state attorney in Tallahassee, declared this week. Self-defense is being invoked in everything from gang shootings to backyard disputes between neighbors, with prosecutors left to disprove the shooters' claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stand Your Ground laws are abominations that should be repealed. One obvious flaw among many is that slain victims can never tell their side of the story -- an undisputed fact in the tragic slaying of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The parents of a Florida teen shot dead by a neighborhood watch captain vowed at a Union Square rally last night to seek justice for their son. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin did matter . . . We are not going to stop until we get justice for Trayvon,&quot; the teen's father, Tracy Martin, told a crowd of 1,200.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He described his 17-year-old son as &quot;your typical teenager . . . Trayvon was not, and I repeat, was not a bad person.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He lashed out at George Zimmerman, the 28-year-old aspiring law officer who claims he killed Trayvon in self defense while patrolling his gated community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;George Zimmerman took Trayvon's life for nothing,&quot; Martin said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Our son was not committing any crime,&quot; said Trayvon's mother, Sybrina Fulton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;This is not about a black-and-white thing. This is about right and wrong,&quot; she told the crowd. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trayvon carried no weapon, and died less than 100 yards from his father's home in Sanford, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many attending the &quot;Million Hoodie March&quot; wore hoodies just like the one Trayvon wore when he was shot dead on Feb. 26. Some also carried bags of Skittles, the candy Trayvon bought at a convenience store &shy;moments before his death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trayvon's parents didn't learn of the rally until after they arrived in New York for a round of media appearances. Some of the rally's organizers were &shy;affiliated with Occupy Wall Street. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because he claims Trayvon attacked him, Zimmerman has not been arrested or charged. Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law gives people the right to shoot instead of retreat if they feel they're in danger of &quot;death or great bodily harm.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last night, enraged demonstrators chanted &quot;We want arrests!&quot; during the march. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A grand jury in Florida will begin hearing the case next month.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Justice Department is also probing the shooting death. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unarmed black teenager shot to death by a neighbourhood watch volunteer in Florida told his girlfriend he was being followed shortly before the confrontation that killed him, a lawyer said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has sparked protests and drawn attention to the growing number of American states that allow people to use deadly force if they feel threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 28, says he shot 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last month in self-defence during a confrontation in a Florida community. He has not been charged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was returning home from a trip to a convenience store carrying only a bag of Skittles and a bottle of iced tea. Since it was raining, he wore a hooded top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A phone call that recorded Martin&quot;s final moments was disclosed as the US Justice Department opened a federal civil rights probe into the February 27 shooting and the local prosecutor convened a grand jury to investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil rights division, with the FBI, will attempt to establish how detectives concluded that a slight, 17-year-old boy represented a mortal threat to his stocky killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin&quot;s parents are doggedly campaigning for a proper investigation into the shooting. His mother, Sybrina Fulton, appeared on television on Tuesday to allege that her son was killed because Zimmerman was: &quot;reacting to the colour of his skin&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represents Martin&quot;s parents, said the teenager was on the phone with his girlfriend when he told her he was being followed. Martin told the girl he&quot;d taken shelter from the rain briefly at an apartment building before continuing his walk to where he was staying with his father nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He says, &quot;Oh, he&quot;s right behind me, he&quot;s right behind me again&quot;,&quot; Crump says the girl told him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She says, &quot;Run&quot;, he says, &quot;I&quot;m not going to run, I&quot;m just going to walk fast.&quot; She hears Trayvon say, &quot;Why are you following me?&quot; Other voice says, &quot;What are you doing around here?&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told Crump they both repeated themselves and then she thinks she heard Zimmerman push Martin &quot;because his voice changes like something interrupted his speech.&quot; She heard an altercation and then the phone call was cut off. She didn&quot;t hear the gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say Zimmerman was bleeding from his nose and the back of his head, and told police he had yelled out for help before he shot Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump said yesterday that it was Martin who cried out when a man bearing a 9mm handgun came at him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She absolutely blows Zimmerman&quot;s absurd self-defence claim out of the water,&quot; Crump said of Martin&quot;s girlfriend, whose name was withheld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin called his 16-year-old girlfriend in Miami several times on February 27, Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin&quot;s father discovered the lengthy conversations by checking his son&quot;s cellphone log, Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last call was at 7.12pm local time. Police arrived at 7.17pm to find Martin lying face down on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was handcuffed after police arrived and taken into custody for questioning, but was released by police without being charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not rest until he is arrested,&quot; Crump said. &quot;The more time that passes, this is going to be swept under the rug.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer said he planned to turn over information about the call to federal investigators; a grand jury is also likely to subpoena the records. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is also involved in the state case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has ignited a furore against the local police department of this Orlando suburb of 53,500 people, sparking rallies and a protest in Governor Rick Scott&quot;s office yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department&quot;s Civil Rights Division plans to send its community relations service to Sanford to &quot;address tension in the community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a town hall meeting, more than 350 people packed into the Allen Chapel AME Church in a traditionally black neighbourhood of Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders urged residents to remain calm but demand Zimmerman be arrested. They also said the town&quot;s police chief should step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities may be limited by a state law that allows people to defend themselves with deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida was the first state to pass in 2005 a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which has been dubbed a &quot;Shoot First&quot; law by gun control advocates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About half of all US states now had similar laws, said Brian Malte, legislative director of the Brady Campaign, described as the nation&quot;s largest organisation dedicated to the prevention of gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;THIS GUY LOOKS LIKE HE&quot;S UP TO NO GOOD&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman had followed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin despite being advised not to by a police operator. Zimmerman can be heard on emergency tape calling police to report a suspicious character where he lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy looks like he&quot;s up to no good, or he&quot;s on drugs or something,&quot; he tells the dispatcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These arseholes, they always get away,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman tells the operator that he is following Martin, after which the operator tells him not to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second 911 call, this time from a neighbour who witnessed a struggle between the two men, could also prove crucial to any future investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighbour says she can hear &quot;someone screaming outside&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don&quot;t know why. I think they&quot;re yelling help but I don&quot;t know,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sound of a struggle can be heard, followed by gunshots.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father of a black teenager shot to death by a neighbourhood watch captain in Florida said he was &quot;honoured&quot; by a march being planned in New York in support of his son. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel very honoured that New York would do a rally in my son&quot;s honor,&quot; Tracy Martin told The Associated Press, hours before what was being called the Million Hoodie March was supposed to take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin&quot;s son, 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, was killed Feb. 26 after buying candy at a convenience store. He was unarmed and wearing a hooded sweat shirt at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooter, George Zimmerman, has not been charged and has said he shot the teen in self-defence after Martin attacked him. Police said Zimmerman is white; his family says he is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has ignited a furor against the police department of the Orlando suburb, prompting rallies and a protest in Gov. Rick Scott&quot;s office Tuesday. The US Justice Department has opened a civil rights probe into the shooting, and Seminole County State Attorney Norm Wolfinger said a grand jury will meet April 10 to consider evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin said he and his son&quot;s mother, Sybrina Fulton, found out about the march after arriving in New York, where they have done interviews about the situation. They contacted the organisers to say they would come and speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing is &quot;incredible,&quot; said Daniel Maree, one of the organisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Martin said he was trying to stay strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don&quot;t feel this is the time to break down, even though it&quot;s a very troubling time in my life,&quot; he said. &quot;I&quot;ve told myself, when I get justice for Trayvon, then I&quot;ll have my time to break down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My son did not deserve to die,&quot; the teenager&quot;s father, Tracy Martin, said after thanking the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin&quot;s son, 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, was killed Feb. 26, in Sanford, Florida. He was returning to a gated community in the city after buying candy at a convenience store. He was unarmed and was wearing a hooded sweat shirt, called a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighbourhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, has not been charged in the shooting. Zimmerman has said the teen attacked him and he shot him in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday night, demonstrators chanted &quot;we want arrests&quot; during the Million Hoodie March in Manhattan&quot;s Union Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teen&quot;s mother, Sybrina Fulton, told the crowd: &quot;My heart is in pain, but to see the support of all of you really makes a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators greeted the teen&quot;s parents with &quot;God bless you!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has ignited a furour against the police department of the Orlando suburb of 53,500 people, prompting rallies and a protest in Gov. Rick Scott&quot;s office. The Justice Department&quot;s Civil Rights Division said it is sending its community relations service this week to Sanford to &quot;address tension in the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the week, the federal agency opened a civil rights probe into the shooting, and in Florida, Seminole County State Attorney Norm Wolfinger said a grand jury will meet April 10 to consider evidence in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Martin said he and his son&quot;s mother found out about the march after arriving in New York City, where they have done interviews about the case. They got in touch with the organizers to say they would attend and speak to the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing of the teen&quot;s parents being in the city when the march was happening was &quot;incredible,&quot; said one of the organizers, Daniel Maree, who heard about the case earlier this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was outraged and wanted to do something about it,&quot; Maree said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, information surrounding the teen&quot;s death has been coming out, including 911 calls and an account from his family&quot;s lawyer of a conversation he had with his girlfriend in the moments before his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Martin, asked how he was holding up, said he was trying to stay strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don&quot;t feel this is the time to break down, even though it&quot;s a very troubling time in my life,&quot; he said. &quot;I&quot;ve told myself, when I get justice for Trayvon, then I&quot;ll have my time to break down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">College students are among those attempting to bring an arrest in the fatal shooting of an unarmed teen in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, many were posting photos of themselves in hooded sweatshirts, as Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was wearing when he was shot and killed during a confrontation with a neighborhood watch captain on Feb. 26. And tonight, they are expected to join hundreds at a rally featuring the Rev. Al Sharpton at a Sanford church. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 15 students from Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach have signed up for the rally that starts at 7 p.m. outside First Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church, 700 S. Elm Ave., Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And many more B-CU students are expected to attend a March 31 NAACP protest in Sanford, said Ebony Minter, the school's student- government president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the justice rallies throughout history have been led by college students. This is not anything new,&quot; Minter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students getting involved also have a role model with a statue in her honor on the Daytona Beach campus bearing her name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our founder, Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, was a champion of civil rights . . . (for) standing up for those who were disenfranchised and not being treated in a manner that is right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could be Trayvon&nbsp;Martin tomorrow in Daytona Beach,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even students who aren't planning on attending the rallies are posting messages of support on Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christine Jacobson, a senior at Stetson University in DeLand, said students are signing petitions calling for changes to Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which legal experts say has made difficult the arrest of the shooter, George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I definitely would stand in solidarity with those who are calling for the arrest of George Zimmerman,&quot; Jacobson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. L. Ronald Durham, pastor of Greater Friendship Missionary Baptist Church in Daytona Beach, is part of the team organizing tonight's rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the event is expecting numbers too great to fit inside the Sanford church so arrangements are being made to have the gathering outdoors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are trying to minimize any potential problems,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't want people who are angry over the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin shooting to become even angrier because they can't see what is going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An armed George Zimmerman apparently took very little time to determine that an unarmed 17-year-old boy carrying iced tea and Skittles represented a threat serious enough for him to confront and fatally shoot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Gov. Scott is right that the state should take much longer to assess the law that may prevent authorities from charging Mr. Zimmerman with a crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2005, the Legislature considered a major, dangerous expansion of Florida's &quot;castle doctrine.&quot; Like most states, Florida allowed homeowners to defend themselves in their &quot;dwellings,&quot; using deadly force if necessary, but required that deadly force be used as a last resort, and used only after doing everything -- including retreating -- to avoid a deadly confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Bill 436 made two major changes. It expanded the definition of &quot;dwelling&quot; to include basically any place, including cars. It also eliminated the need to retreat. Law enforcement opposed the legislation, fearing that it could create a vigilante culture. &quot;I dislike the law because it encourages people to stand their ground ... when they could just as easily walk away,&quot; said Barry Krischer, who at the time was Palm Beach County's state attorney. &quot;To me, that's not a civilized society.&quot; The National Rifle Association said lawful gun owners needed the protection, even though the House and Senate analyses of the bill made no reference to a rise in wrongful self-defense prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As usual, the NRA prevailed, exploiting its customary leverage with Republicans and Democrats' new worries that support for gun control had hurt their party in the 2004 elections. Thirteen of the 36 Democrats in the House voted for the bill. So did all 14 Democrats in the Senate. One of them, Dave Aronberg, said, &quot;We're trying to show that, if you are a gun owner, you are a Democrat, too.&quot; Mr. Aronberg is running for Mr. Krischer's old job, and for the power to decide &quot;castle doctrine&quot; cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though supporters could cite no numbers to support their case seven years ago, the number of self-defense claims statewide since then reportedly has spiked roughly 250 percent. State Sen. Chris Smith, D-Fort Lauderdale, said Wednesday he is preparing legislation to repeal the 2005 law, but any bill at this point also is premature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Sanford, near Orlando, have not charged Mr. Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and say their investigation is over. Given the circumstances, multiple investigations must follow. If Mr. Zimmerman provoked a needless confrontation and killed a man who represented no threat, then can claim self-defense and get away with it, the critics were right about what then-Gov. Jeb Bush called an &quot;anti-crime&quot; law seven years ago. Whatever happens to Mr. Zimmerman, SB 436 and those who voted for it were his accomplices.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facing a choice between renewable energy and more bird deaths, Palm Beach County commissioners will decide today whether to approve plans for Florida's first wind farm on farm land near Belle Glade. Commissioners should move the project along but require more study of the proposed turbines' effect on endangered species and insist that the wind farm track and mitigate bird deaths. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project calls for more than 100 wind turbines, standing 500 feet tall, on 12,000 acres of farmland. The turbines, which St. Louis-based Wind Capital Group would build and own, would generate enough electricity to power roughly 60,000 homes. The company then would sell the power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project's immediate economic benefits are small. The wind farm would create less than two dozen permanent local jobs, and would primarily generate revenue for the state through sales taxes on energy sales. But the larger benefits of renewable energy that does not consume fossil fuels or water are manifold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservation groups such as Audubon of Florida are rightly concerned about the potential effect of these turbines on bird populations, particularly endangered species such as the wood stork and Everglades snail kite. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shares some of those worries, and argues that it needs &quot;at least three years of pre-construction baseline data&quot; before being able to sufficiently assess the turbines' impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, there is time for more study because two regulatory agencies, the state Department of Environmental Protection and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, need to approve the turbines before they can be built. With additional time, both agencies will be better positioned to weigh the project's impact on birds against the merits of green energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As long as the inevitable bird deaths do not do unacceptable harm to endangered bird populations or migratory patterns, the project will likely be a good one, and may encourage further investment in clean power. The turbines' potential risks should not be understated, but neither should the global importance of encouraging the production of renewable energy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't need you to do that,&quot; the dispatcher said, echoing the advice Palm Beach County police agencies said they would have given him. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman confronted Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in his gated community in Sanford, north of Orlando, and fatally shot the Miami Gardens 17-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He calls it self-defense. Martin's family calls it murder and wants the neighborhood watch volunteer criminally charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mostly not in dispute: If Zimmerman doesn't leave his car, Martin isn't dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement authorities instruct neighborhood watches, and even sanctioned volunteer programs such as Citizens on Patrol, or COP, to never approach or pursue someone, but rather to call 911 -- and to never use a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sheriff's office has more than 3,000 COP volunteers. Many wear uniforms and drive marked sheriff's cruisers. But they do not carry weapons and are instructed not to confront people but to be &quot;eyes and ears,&quot; spokeswoman Teri Barbera said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said officer Ellen Lovejoy, spokeswoman for Palm Beach Gardens police: &quot;We always tell people not to confront. Not just neighborhood watch groups. Everyone. To call the police department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There should have been no confrontation whatsoever. Make your phone call. Stand aside,&quot; said Chris Tutko, director of Neighborhood Watch for the National Sheriff's Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Retreat at Twin Lakes community told Sanford police it wanted to start a neighborhood watch, city volunteer program coordinator Wendy Dorival spoke to them in September. Her PowerPoint presentation, and a neighborhood watch manual the city makes available, both make clear: Don't confront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The philosophy is, 'No weapons. Don't confront. Call the police,'&quot; Dorival said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that was her last dealings with the neighborhood, which chose its own leaders and had no sanctioning or accrediting relationship with law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Sheriff's Association said Wednesday it has &quot;no information indicating the community where the incident occurred has ever even registered with the NSA Neighborhood Watch program.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* 'It should be emphasized to members that they do not possess police powers and they shall not carry weapons or pursue vehicles.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Town-watch volunteer George Zimmerman told Florida police he felt so threatened by a 17-year-old high schooler toting only a soft drink and a bag of Skittles that he had to gun him down.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As preposterous as that sounds, the self-defense claim carried enough weight with police in the Seminole County town of Sanford that Zimmerman, 28, has yet to be charged in the death of Trayvon Martin, a well-liked Miami teen with no criminal record. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's because Florida - like Pennsylvania, among nearly two-dozen other states - in recent years enacted a reckless law that gives citizens the right to use lethal force if they feel threatened. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, Zimmerman's story is unraveling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the welcome news late Monday that the U.S. Justice Department will open a civil-rights investigation - along with a Florida county grand jury probe - more and more troubling details of the Feb. 26 shooting of Martin are coming to light. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a 911 call in which Zimmerman was told by police to back off, rather than approach the teen he suspected of planning a break-in. He ignored the directive. Moments later, he shot Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the 911 recording, Zimmerman is heard to utter a racial epithet and express frustration that criminals &quot;always get away.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most damaging of all to Zimmerman's claim that he was attacked, without anyone as a witness, is a report that a clearly worried Martin phoned his girlfriend to tell her he was being stalked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full investigation that's warranted also must examine why Sanford police failed to test Zimmerman's sobriety. Was there racial bias in how police approached the case? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as this incident gets intense scrutiny, there's still all the self-defense statutes that could shield other reckless shooters. It's a problem that could come home to roost in any Pennsylvania community - especially in Philadelphia, where gun violence is epidemic in some neighborhoods. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While long recognized as a valid defense when someone is attacked inside his home, these expanded &quot;castle doctrine&quot; laws, as they're known, now cover virtually every setting. With states also being pushed by the National Rifle Association to loosen rules on carrying weapons, and gun owners emboldened by expanded self-defense rules, the risk for violent confrontations grows. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So a road-rage incident or tavern quarrel that might have led to a scuffle may now erupt in gunfire, with the last man standing claiming a right to shoot because he felt threatened. Even more perverse, drug dealers and other criminals settling scores can claim a legal right to replay the O.K. Corral. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Harrisburg, both Gov. Corbett and the majority-holding Republican lawmakers knew the risks when they expanded the state's &quot;castle&quot; doctrine last year. With the Florida case, they have more than enough evidence that the law should be repealed.    </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YOUR MARCH 20 editorial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">(&quot;College Loans the Next Debt Bomb&quot;)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> correctly brings attention to a concern for many families, but it fails to mention one important strategy to address this dilemma: saving for college.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saving for higher education offers enormous benefits compared to borrowing. If a family saves $25 a month, it could have about $10,264 after 18 years. Those savings can gain state tax deductions, too. Meanwhile, someone who repays a $10,000 loan with interest over 18 years would ultimately pay $18,563 without any favorable state tax treatment. That is at least an $8,300 difference. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As state treasurer, I administer Pennsylvania's 529 College Savings Program. I understand budgets are tight for many families, but even small contributions to a PA 529 plan will help meet the costs of higher education.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, his repeated filming and texting about what he had done were less forgivable. It is hard to imagine why we should be sympathetic to his attempts to embarrass, expose, and harass his roommate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the jury also found him guilty of a variety of other crimes - serious crimes - that were not directly related to his boorish, offensive, and homophobic behavior. He lied to investigators, attempted to influence a witness and tampered with evidence after he tried to cover up the avalanche of Twitter and text messages that he had used to spread the word of the film he had posted. This is surely a sad tale of lives ruined and the anguish of parents and relatives over the death of one child and the probable incarceration and likely deportation of another. But, it is hard to feel much sympathy for someone who tried so hard to violate the privacy of his roommate and tried even harder to cover up what he knew to be deeply wrong and criminal behavior. If we feel sympathy because Ravi might be deported, we should ask Congress to finally revamp our immigration laws. I hope that happens, and perhaps it will happen before Ravi is released from prison for lying to investigators, tampering with evidence, and trying to influence witnesses in his futile attempt to undermine the justice system, just as he undermined his roommate's privacy. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My &quot;little&quot; brother is a police officer in Maryland who is 6 feet  tall. We're a bit more than two years apart in age, so when we were  young we played together -- and, of course, got in trouble together. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days, he often wears baggy clothes, topped with one of those  Gilligan-type hats. He has been known to hug his sisters  enthusiastically off the floor upon seeing them. (Who needs  chiropractors?) He's also a great father to a son about 10 weeks older  than mine, and a fine uncle. The first time he met my son, he calmed him  by resting the baby's head in the crook of his arm, and sure enough, he  was asleep in less than a minute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like my brother, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin meant something to his family. He has  parents, a young brother and extended family that love him. To another  man, the 17-year-old wasn't even human. He was suspicious, and that  apparently was based on nothing more than his skin color. George  Zimmerman, a neighborhood-watch captain, shot and killed Trayvon in a  gated community in Sanford, Fla., last month. He lumped Trayvon in with  those who &quot;always get away&quot; in a 911 call that night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You could blame Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law. Although &quot;law&quot; is  probably too strong a term for something that basically allows someone  to start a fight -- and finish it. It's that &quot;law&quot; that might keep  Zimmerman out of prison. The fact that Zimmerman hasn't yet been  arrested suggests that some Florida law enforcement officials agree with  the idea that a black man walking down your street is a reason to  defend yourself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After days of protests to call attention to Trayvon's fatal shooting,  the federal government announced it is looking at the incident as a  possible hate crime and Florida is convening a grand jury to look into  the circumstances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania has no &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law. But in 2006, the Trib  reported that Allegheny County had the highest number of legal  concealed-weapon permits in Pennsylvania -- just in case you think what  happened in Florida could never happen here. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the heart of this crime (arrest or no) is racism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mostly, my approach to racism has been this: If you have a problem  with me being black, it's your problem, not mine. It turns out I've been  wrong. It is my problem, and the problem of my brother, and my father and my son and my uncles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not the buffoonery of the Ku Klux Klan that's the most dangerous  form of racism. It's the quiet kind that tells a man with a gun that a  black male walking down the street in a hoodie is a threat to him. You  can turn out against a KKK rally to show distaste, but what can be done  about a man who views an unarmed black teen talking on his cell phone as  suspicious? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing, that's what. There will be more protests in the coming  weeks, and Zimmerman might even end up going to prison one day. But you  can't change a heart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I love my brother. Yet if he had been walking down that Sanford  street under the same circumstances, he would have been shot down like  the animal he isn't. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there's nothing I can do to help or protect the black men in my  life, except to write a column about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and hope it makes at  least one person realize there is a human under that hoodie. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The nation's top economic policymakers said Wednesday that although Europe's long-simmering sovereign-debt crisis continues to weigh on growth, its threat to the U.S. economy has diminished significantly in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testifying before the House oversight committee, Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Europe had made progress in assuring investors of the safety of the euro currency and ensuring market access for all eurozone economies. As a result, strains on the global financial system have eased and the outlook has brightened, they said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the past few months, financial stresses in Europe have lessened, which has contributed to an improved tone of financial markets around the world, including in the United States,&quot; Mr. Bernanke said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Geithner said, &quot;The European economies at the center of the crisis have made very significant progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spy for Israel sentenced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- A former National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientist was sentenced to 13 years in prison Wednesday for attempted spying after admitting he tried to pass classified data on U.S. satellites to Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stewart D. Nozette, 54, of Chevy Chase, Md., was sentenced to the term agreed to by prosecutors and defense lawyers in September when Mr. Nozette pleaded guilty to attempted espionage. He was also sentenced for an earlier guilty plea in a false-claims and tax-evasion case. U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman ordered Mr. Nozette to pay about $218,000 in restitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March for slain Fla. teen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- The parents of a black teenager shot to death by a Hispanic neighborhood watch captain in Florida marched in his memory on Wednesday in Manhattan with hundreds of other people demanding arrests in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not going to stop until we get justice,&quot; said the teenager's father, Tracy Martin, after thanking the crowd. &quot;My son did not deserve to die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Martin's son, Trayvon Martin, 17, was killed Feb. 26, in Sanford, Fla. He was returning to a gated community in the city after buying candy at a convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jewelry theft ring busted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RICHMOND, Va. -- Federal officials have arrested seven people in a criminal ring that stole more than $4.6 million in jewelry in at least seven states, the U.S. attorney's office said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thieves, part of an organized network with ties to South America, allegedly conducted surveillance on jewelry stores and then stole from traveling sales representatives, said Neil H. MacBride, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Kony' creator hospitalized</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN DIEGO -- Invisible Children filmmaker Jason Russell, who created the viral &quot;Kony 2012&quot; video, will remain in the hospital for several weeks for what his wife described as &quot;reactive psychosis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement released Wednesday, his wife and other family members said they believe this condition caused him to act strangely last week, ranting and roaming around a San Diego street in the nude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asian population soars</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Asian population of the United States grew faster than any other racial or ethnic group in the last decade, according to a new U.S. Census Bureau report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of Americans identifying themselves as Asian alone or in combination with another race surged 45.6 percent from 11.9 million in 2000 to 17.3 million in 2010, driven mainly by international migration, census officials said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROTC back at Harvard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAMBRIDGE, Mass -- Harvard University announced Wednesday that it would open a campus office for the Army ROTC later this year, a move that the Army believes will lead to greater participation in the program by Harvard undergraduates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement is the latest by several prominent universities to welcome the Reserve Officers' Training Corps back on campus four decades after they banned it because of the Vietnam War. Those bans continued into recent years on the grounds that the military discriminated against gay and lesbian troops by barring them from serving openly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entire country is talking about what happened to a 17-year-old Florida teen, shot dead while walking back from the store with an iced tea and a bag of Skittles in hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin and his father were visiting his dad's fianc&eacute;e, who lived in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., outside of Orlando last month when a self-appointed Neighborhood Watch captain, George Zimmerman, saw Martin and called police to report a &quot;suspicious&quot; man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the 911 tapes: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: &quot;We had some break-ins in our neighborhood ... and there is a real suspicious guy. ... This guy looks like he's up to no good, he's on drugs or something. It's raining, and he's walking around looking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dispatcher: &quot;Is this guy white, black, Hispanic?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: &quot;He looks black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dispatcher: &quot;Did you see what he's wearing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: &quot;A dark hoodie, gray hoodie, jeans or sweatpants or white shoes. He's walking around staring at the houses. Now he's just staring at me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dispatcher: &quot;Location?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: &quot;He's near the clubhouse right now. Now he's coming towards me. He has his hands in his waistband. He is a black male. Something's wrong with him. Yep. He's coming to check me out. He's got something in his hands. I don't know what his deal is. Send officers over here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, directions to the police to find the young man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: &quot;He's running ... down towards the other entrance of the neighborhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More back and forth, then:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dispatcher: &quot;Are you following him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: &quot;Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dispatcher: &quot;OK. We don't need you to do that. What's your name?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: &quot;George. Zimmerman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time Zimmerman was calling 911, Martin was talking to a girl on his cellphone. From her, we hear a different turn of events. Martin told her that someone was following him. She told him to run, but Martin said he would walk quickly instead. According to the girl, Zimmerman caught up with him. Martin asked Zimmerman why he was being followed. Zimmerman asked the young man's name. The girl says she heard Zimmerman push Martin, but then the call dropped. She tried calling back. No answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other calls flooded in to 911, neighbors asking for help because they had heard an altercation and then a shot. They reported screams for help. They reported a man down, another man with a flashlight. Some saw a man with a white T-shirt on top of another person. Police arrived, and Zimmerman told police he acted in self-defense. Self-defense after stalking a young man for no reason. Self-defense from a man with a gun. Self-defense from the person who started the confrontation. The police took Zimmernan's word, did not arrest him and took Martin to the morgue. They didn't even bother to try to find his family by calling numbers on his phone. Police drug-tested the victim, but not his killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world is outraged. Sadly, bringing the self-admitted shooter to justice will not be easy. Florida's stand-your-ground law allows a person who feels threatened to kill, with almost no questions asked. That is why police say they let Zimmerman go. Still, people are not accepting that reasoning. When local authorities said they believed Zimmerman's story of self-defense, the cry for justice became so loud that the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI decided this week to investigate. The case also has been referred to a state grand jury, scheduled to convene April 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other questions need to be answered. Neighborhood Watch guidelines forbid the carrying of guns -- why did Zimmerman have a 9mm pistol? Why did Zimmerman not heed the dispatcher's warning not to follow Martin? Over everything is this question: Why does Florida have a law that allows murderers to claim self-defense so easily? And as Martin's parents argue so poignantly, why is their son's killer loose on the street? Even with Florida's invitation-to-shoot law, Zimmerman could be arrested and charged. Let a judge and jury decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those of us in New Mexico, there is this to ponder. The stand-your-ground law is hardly unique to Florida -- it was pushed by the National Rifle Association there and exists in 16 other states. Those of us in states without such laws must be vigilant before the vigilantes rule our streets and walking while black -- or brown -- becomes a capital offense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: How wonderful it was to read your March 23 article about ArtSPARK and the work it is doing to bring the arts to schools in Santa Clara County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In San Mateo County, the Mid-Peninsula League of the San Francisco Symphony, just one of the 10 symphony leagues serving the Bay Area, has nine docents who go into three schools in the Ravenswood City School District. They give five hour-long tutorials to the second and third grades. This league raises funds to purchase the 350 tickets and rent the seven buses needed to attend the Concert for Kids at Davies Hall performed by the San Francisco Symphony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The San Francisco Symphony has many similar programs in its education outreach programs. Its Concerts for Kids started in 1919 and now has about 35,000 children attending annually from all over the Bay Area. Students in grades K-6 are prepared by docents from the various symphony leagues to go up to Davies Symphony Hall and hear the music and instruments they have learned about. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The San Francisco Symphony is dynamically led by Donato Cabrera, director of its renowned Youth Orchestra. The music ranges from classical to &quot;Star Wars,&quot; with a great deal of audience participation, which the students love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mimi Kugushev,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Menlo Park</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Go with natural gas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: Now the brains want to electrify Caltrain for the small price of $1.5 billion. Has anyone asked what the return on that investment is and how long it will take to pay for itself? The price of electricity is high; the price of natural gas is low. Why don't we just transform diesel engines into natural gas engines? It would be cheaper, we would not disrupt the roadways and everyone would win. But I am just a poor, dumb California native.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pat White,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Menlo Park</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fees for little-used services</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: The newspapers have reported that Palo Alto is considering adding flat rates for street sweeping, hazardous waste and bulk waste pickup at individual locations. The last service already had a fee attached and is used by few people. The hazardous waste fee would be charging everyone for a service few use and the street sweeping fee would also be charging residents who live on streets that do not receive street sweeping, such as private streets and culs-de-sac. It may not even be legal to charge people for services they do not receive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why not just charge a flat fee for a service almost everyone does use: recycling? That would be more honest, and people who support recycling probably would not mind paying a small fee for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natalie Fisher,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palo Alto</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mixed messages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi is charged and arrested for grabbing his wife's arm. Yet, volunteer neighborhood watch zealot George Zimmerman, instructed by a 911 operator to cease his distorted surveillance, hunts down and murders Trayvon Martin in cold blood and is not charged but walking free in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So my suggestion to any parent in San Francisco is, if you're shopping and you feel the need to grab a hold of your child, watch out because you may be facing criminal charges. But if you're in Florida and you are returning home from the store with some Skittles and a soda, watch out or you may be found dead at the end of a lunatic's gun.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SARASOTA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local attorneys who have successfully defended accused murderers using Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law say it is a good tactic for law-abiding citizens who are threatened, but would be misapplied in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, an unarmed black teenager, was killed Feb. 26 in a gated town house community in Sanford when he was shot by a crime watch volunteer as he walked home from a convenience store. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 28, reported a suspicious person to 911 and then followed Martin. Zimmerman, described as white Hispanic, has not been arrested. He told police he fired on Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in self-defense when the teenager attacked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradenton attorney Charlie Britt and Eric Reisinger of Sarasota have successfully defended clients using the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; defense, and both were surprised that Martin's accused shooter has not yet been charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, Britt had second-degree murder charges against his client, Edwin Vargas-Lopez, dropped after filing a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; immunity motion -- the first use of the 2005 statute in Manatee County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vargas-Lopez had been drinking and dancing at a club on Cortez Road. After he danced with a waitress, someone became jealous and struck him in the head. Vargas-Lopez struggled to his truck and shut the door, but several people punched him and tried to pull him out of the window, including 32-year-old Fernando Castulo Morales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vargas-Lopez grabbed a knife and swung with the weapon, striking Morales in the chest and killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britt argued his client was in fear for his life, and that he had a right to protect himself; the judge agreed. &quot;It worked out well for Edwin,&quot; Britt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida law allows a person who is &quot;not engaged in any unlawful activity&quot; to &quot;meet force with force,&quot; including the use of deadly force. It does not require a person to retreat if they are in a public place, a requirement of previous state laws, and therefore allows them to &quot;stand their ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a good law, and it should be the law,&quot; said Britt, a former law enforcement officer. &quot;If you're in a life-and-death situation, sometimes you have the opportunity to retreat, sometimes you don't. The law shouldn't require you to run if it would compromise your life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britt has another case pending in which his client may claim a defense under &quot;Stand Your Ground.&quot; The man fired several shots into the air to stop a crowd of people who were advancing on him, including some whom he believed were armed. No one was injured, but Britt's client was charged with unlawful discharge of a firearm. These charges, too, will likely be dismissed, Britt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that in a public place, you should be able to use deadly force,&quot; Britt said. &quot;The cops can use it. Why can't I?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, Sarasota's Reisinger had second-degree murder charges against his client, Alphonse Gallo, dropped due to this type of defense, the first time the law was used in Sarasota County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 2010, Gallo was confronted by three people he thought were going to rob him outside a Newtown bar, including Patrick Barbour, whom Gallo fought with earlier that evening. Gallo testified later that Barbour pulled out a firearm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gallo, who had a concealed weapon permit, produced his pistol and a firefight ensued. More than two dozen rounds were exchanged between Gallo, Barbour and Barbour's friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it was over, Barbour had been hit three times and later died. Reisinger filed a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; immunity motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The victim threatened to shoot my client. My client defended himself. The judge granted the motion for immunity,&quot; Reisinger said. &quot;For law-abiding citizens who aren't causing trouble, it's a good law. People have a right to defend themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Reisinger said he doesn't think the law applies. &quot;By all accounts, he instigated the altercation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britt also said it appears as though the accused shooter took the fight to Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know what happened,&quot; Britt said. &quot;He said the kid came at him. Who's going to dispute it? The kid's dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the country, more states are adopting similar statutes after recent decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court clarified a person's right to self-defense, said Delaware attorney John Sigler, past president of the National Rifle Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known as &quot;castle doctrines,&quot; the laws codify people's right to defend themselves in their home or &quot;castle.&quot; Florida had that law in place for years before enacting &quot;Stand Your Ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many states required people to retreat if confronted in their own home. That didn't make sense and the laws were changed,&quot; Sigler said. &quot;The next logical step is why should people be required to retreat anywhere, if they are there legally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This doctrine, however, may not apply in the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 22--What if the roles were reversed? What if George Zimmerman died and Trayvon Martin claimed self-defense after a street fight? Or if a gun-toting black adult shot and killed an unarmed light-skinned teen walking home from a store with candy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among South Florida blacks I spoke with on Wednesday, the feeling was unanimous. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it was a black guy who shot a white kid, he'd be arrested on the spot,&quot; said Juwan Morgan, 15, of Fort Lauderdale, a sophomore at South Broward High in Hollywood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He'd have been thrown in jail -- quickly,&quot; said Cynthia Burrows, 57, president of the Northwest Federated Woman's Club of Broward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole thing is wrong -- but it's been like this forever,&quot; said laborer Russo Durocher, 21, outside a northwest Fort Lauderdale convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, of Miami Gardens, was visiting his father in central Florida when he was shot dead Feb. 26 by neighborhood watch volunteer Zimmerman. Nearly a month later, anger and protests keep building. Zimmerman has not been arrested or charged after claiming self-defense under Florida's controversial &quot;stand your ground law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anger is especially pronounced among blacks, who say a double standard is at work. Martin was black; Zimmerman is Hispanic, according to his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's incendiary -- everyone's talking about it,&quot; said Burrows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He should be in jail, but they don't even know where the guy (Zimmerman) is,&quot; said Edde Campbell, 68, of Fort Lauderdale. &quot;He might be long gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Race is the elephant in the room,&quot; said Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Martin's family, who held a Fort Lauderdale news conference this week. Crump said Sanford police treated Zimmerman with deference, not bothering to test him for drugs or alcohol after the shooting and eagerly accepting his self-defense claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burrows said she was chilled by the police tape where Zimmerman said Martin, who was wearing a hoodie, was &quot;up to no good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think (Zimmerman) made up his mind to go after him,&quot; Burrows said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she fears for her 11-year-old stepson, who is big for his age. &quot;If he's not smiling, he can look menacing,&quot; Burrows said. &quot;I try to impress on him to not dress with those sloppy pants, big shirts or skullcaps. When we were growing up we were taught how to avoid confrontations. Today they call it fitting in, but we called it survival.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juwan Morgan said his mother worries for his safety. A member of his school's baseball team, he said he was once &quot;almost arrested&quot; at a Burger King because he matched the description of a robbery suspect. &quot;I was carrying my baseball bag,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thelma Robinson, 68, of Fort Lauderdale said her grandsons, 21 and 20, have been pulled over by police &quot;many times, for no good reason,&quot; once subjected to drug-sniffing dogs. She doesn't understand how someone can pursue and shoot an unarmed teen and not be arrested. &quot;I'm getting fed up,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Burrows: &quot;We know the justice system can work. We just want it to work for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, join in a march in New York on Wednesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - The parents of a black teenager shot to death by a Hispanic neighborhood watch captain in Florida told hundreds of people at a march in his memory on Wednesday that they won't stop until they get justice for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My son did not deserve to die,&quot; the teenager's father, Tracy Martin, said after thanking the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Martin's son, 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, was killed Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla. He was returning to a gated community in the city after buying candy at a convenience store. He was unarmed and was wearing a hooded sweatshirt, called a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, has not been charged in the shooting. Zimmerman has said Martin attacked him and he shot the teen in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Wednesday night, demonstrators chanted &quot;we want arrests&quot; during the Million Hoodie March in Manhattan's Union Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case has ignited a furor against the police department of the Orlando suburb of 53,500 people. Seminole County State Attorney Norm Wolfinger said a grand jury will meet April 10 to consider evidence in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;b&gt;HOUSE PANEL APPROVES NEW GOP BUDGET PLAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WASHINGTON&lt;/b&gt; - Republicans on a key House panel Wednesday muscled through a contentious GOP budget plan to sharply cut federal health care spending and safety-net programs like food stamps as the chief means to attack trillion-dollar-plus deficits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The House Budget Committee approved the GOP plan on a near party-line 19-18 vote, readying it for a House vote next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The GOP plan is nonbinding but calls for repealing President Barack Obama's health care law while transforming Medicare into a voucher-like system in which the government subsidizes purchases of health insurance on the private market instead of directly paying doctor and hospital bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;b&gt;MARINE FACES DISCIPLINE FOR POLITICAL STATEMENTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SAN DIEGO&lt;/b&gt; - The Marine Corps on Wednesday notified a sergeant who has been openly critical of President Barack Obama that he is violating Pentagon policy barring troops from political activities and that he faces dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Camp Pendleton Marine Sgt. Gary Stein started a Facebook page called Armed Forces Tea Party to encourage fellow service members to exercise their free speech rights. He declared a few weeks ago that he would not follow the unlawful orders of the commander in chief. Stein also criticized Defense Secretary Leon Panetta for his comments on Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stein, a nine-year member of the Corps, said he did nothing wrong and planned to fight the charges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama will direct federal agencies to fast-track an oil pipeline from Oklahoma to Texas, backing a segment of the larger Keystone XL project that he rejected earlier this year. The 485-mile line from Cushing, Okla., to refineries on Texas' Gulf coast would remove a critical bottleneck in the country's oil transportation system, as rising oil production has outgrown pipelines' capacity to deliver oil to refineries. Obama's directive, to be announced Thursday, also would apply to other pipelines that alleviate choke points. It will be issued along with an executive order requiring agencies to make faster decisions on other infrastructure projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP forces budget plan - Republicans on a key House panel Wednesday muscled through a contentious GOP budget plan to sharply cut federal health care spending and safety-net programs like food stamps as the chief means to attack trillion-dollar-plus deficits. The House Budget Committee approved the GOP plan on a near party-line 19-18 vote, readying it for a House vote next week. Two tea party favorites, Republican Reps. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas and Justin Amash of Michigan, joined Democrats in opposing the measure, saying it didn't go far enough. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March held for teen - The parents of a black teenager shot to death by a Hispanic neighborhood watch captain in Florida marched in his memory in New York on Wednesday with hundreds of other people demanding arrests in the case. Trayvon Martin, 17, was killed Feb. 26, in Sanford, Fla. He was returning to a gated community in the city after buying candy at a convenience store. He was unarmed and was wearing a hooded sweat shirt, called a hoodie. The neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, has not been charged in the shooting. On Wednesday night, demonstrators chanted &quot;we want arrests&quot; during the Million Hoodie March in Manhattan's Union Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientist sentenced - A former government space scientist was sentenced Wednesday to 13 years in prison for admitting that he tried to sell space and defense secrets to Israel in what turned out to be an FBI sting operation. Appearing in federal court in a prison jumpsuit, Stewart Nozette said he is &quot;paying for a fatal lack of judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supreme Court backs property owners - The Supreme Court strengthened the rights of property owners who are confronted by federal environmental regulators, ruling Wednesday that they are entitled to a hearing to challenge the government's threats to fine them for building on their own land. The 9-0 decision is a victory for Michael and Chantell Sackett, who bought the lot near Priest Lake, Idaho, but after they had cleared the land, they were told by EPA officials they would be fined $7,500 a day until they restored it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York concerned over Iranians - Authorities have interviewed at least 13 people since 2005 with ties to Iran's government who were seen taking pictures of New York City landmarks, a senior New York Police Department official said. Police consider these instances to be pre-operational surveillance, bolstering their concerns that Iran or its proxy terrorist group could be prepared to strike inside the United States, if provoked by escalating tensions between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pesticide is pulled - A pesticide used primarily in the strawberry industry is being pulled from the U.S. market by its Japanese manufacturer, a surprising move that comes after harsh criticism from environmentalists and farm workers who claim the chemical is toxic and may cause cancer. Tokyo-based Arysta LifeScience Inc. said late Tuesday that it was immediately suspending the sales, marketing and production of all formulations of the fumigant Midas, or methyl iodide, in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. suspends search for remains - The United States said it is suspending efforts to recover remains of thousands of fallen service members in North Korea, the latest sign that a recent thaw in relations is over. The U.S. was in the process of resuming the hunt for remains missing from the 1950-53 Korean War that had been on hold since 2005, the only form of cooperation between the two militaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Body discovered - Authorities said they believe a body found outside Williston, N.D., is that of a missing Sidney, Mont., high school math teacher who disappeared Jan. 7 during a morning run. The remains believed to be that of Sherry Arnold are being sent to Missoula for identification. The body had been buried. Police didn't say what led them to that location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge stops man on rampage - A judge in Honolulu put a man in a chokehold for jumping onto his bench and breaking a flagpole bearing the state flag, authorities said. District Judge Lono Lee knocked down Steven Michael Hauge and restrained him, turning him over to police, who arrested him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank goodness similar law was vetoed here</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the recent shooting in Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer of a young man whose only crime seemed to be that he carried a can of iced tea and a box of Skittles, I want to thank Gov. Mark Dayton for vetoing the recent handgun bill that would surely have promised similar violence in Minnesota. Despite instructions from 911 authorities to not follow a &quot;suspicious character&quot; he reported seeing in his neighborhood, and apparently emboldened by a seven-year-old Florida law that allowed him to shoot someone by whom he felt in any way threatened, the volunteer nonetheless left his truck, forced a confrontation and ended a life. That Florida bill, like the Minnesota bill, was opposed widely by law enforcement groups. It creates, as the Minnesota bill would have created, a situation where a shooter need only claim he or she was threatened to justify his or her actions -- while any claims to the contrary lay dead on the ground. Thank you, again, Governor. In cases like this, you remind everyone how, in an election, every vote counts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is appalling that the March 21 coverage (via the New York Times) of the killing of Trayvon Martin framed the story not as a human tragedy and possible gross failure of justice, but only as a test for Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law. If we are to address the issue of self-defense, wouldn't it be pertinent to know details like: The shooter was 80 pounds heavier than the unarmed 17-year-old; there are credible witnesses and audio recordings of the incident that seem to indicate that the killer was never under any threat, but that the victim, after being pursued and confronted, was; and that these witnesses and information have been ignored by the police? Might the story even question what kind of mortal threat a slight 17-year-old with a bag of Skittles posed against an adult with a gun? And finally, no implications were made as to the possible racial aspects of the case. Omitted from the quote &quot;they always get away&quot; was its immediate preface, in which the shooter clearly identifies &quot;they&quot; as black people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Minnesota Nice' is nowhere to be found</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I watched, on public television, the House floor session discussing the constitutional amendment on voter ID from 6 p.m. Tuesday to 12:25 a.m. Wednesday. The DFL found many deficiencies in the language of the proposed amendment and proposed many amendments to correct them specifically to ensure that particular segments of our state population who might have difficulty getting a state-issued photo ID will not be denied the right to vote. All have been rejected on party-line votes, the GOP prevailing. It becomes apparent that suppressing the vote is the intent of the constitutional amendment, because assurances to the contrary are denied entrance. I expect the Star Tribune to report this in detail -- for instance, listing the offered amendments and reporting the vote. No other research or reporting would be necessary; it is all in the record. Report the record and let readers decide what is going on in the wee hours of the night. It is not &quot;Minnesota Nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a political independent, I sometimes shake my head in disbelief by the antics of both the Republican and DFL Parties in our state. However, the most absurd position being taken in Minnesota at this time is the opposition to voter ID by the DFL Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have the Democrats among us forgotten about the numerous examples of voter fraud and expensive and time-consuming election recounts (that we taxpayers pay for)?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have they forgotten about the millions of illegal aliens and other nonresident transients who are in our state and who could easily sway an election if permitted to vote?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is there no concern among Democrats of the potential national security risks associated with a lack of voter ID? Or should we all just stick our heads in the sand and &quot;trust&quot; that nothing like that can happen in &quot;Minnesota Nice&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have laws on the books that dictate who is allowed to vote in elections. I want this law to be enforced and not just &quot;assumed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contention by Democrats that a voter ID law will disadvantage the poor and elderly is an obvious smokescreen, because the law will provide IDs to citizens without a valid driver license and will allow people to use other means to prove their residency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voter ID law has a clear fence line. On one side sits those who support voting laws and fair and accurate elections. On the other side sit those who do not.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was surprised and dismayed at the Business section article March 20 about $15.8 million in tax credits creating 162 new jobs for our state. Simple math tells me the program took almost $100,000 out of the state budget for each job &quot;created&quot; by investors. This same amount of money could have been diverted to hiring 900 full-time paraprofessionals statewide for our struggling schools. Seems like a better investment in our future to me.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law being blamed for a Central Florida killing that has evoked national outrage, Gov. Rick Scott says he will review the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He should do what we advised Gov. Jeb Bush to do six years ago. With the then-new law sparking controversy and fear, we urged him to appoint a task force of law enforcement officials and knowledgeable civilians to review the law's impact and recommend revisions, if necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We vigorously support citizens' right to bear arms and defend themselves. We know gun-control zealots will use any incident to limit access to firearms, and also that many gun advocates don't lose sleep over a legal shooting that could have easily been avoided. When state law appears to encourage armed conflict and handcuff police investigations, something is wrong. The law should be scrutinized dispassionately without the rants and exaggerations that generally accompany gun-control debates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State gun policy should be based on the Constitution and the realities of human nature, not political passions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month a 28-year-old volunteer with a Sanford neighborhood watch killed an unarmed teenager who was walking from a convenience store. George Zimmerman had called 911 to report a suspicious person. Despite being told to wait for police, he pursued 17-year-old Trayvon Martin and, in the resulting confrontation, shot him to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford police made no arrest because Zimmerman, who had a concealed-weapon permit, said he was defending himself. Martin was talking to a girl on his cellphone immediately before he was shot, and she heard him ask, &quot;Why are you following me?&quot; This raises questions about the necessity of any confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, who had no police record and was visiting the nearby house of his father's girlfriend, was black. Al Sharpton and other activists claim racism was a factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't know exactly what happened that night, and neither do Sharpton or the others jumping to conclusions. But the appearances are troubling. At the least, this seems a tragically avoidable death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public attention has generated action, if belatedly. A grand jury will investigate. The Justice Department and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement also are involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of the facts that might emerge in this case, stand your ground should be revisited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police and prosecutors report the law is commonly used by individuals in conflicts that escalate to gunfire and not by people who have been attacked by criminals. The shooter need only claim he felt threatened, and prosecution becomes difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law expanded the &quot;castle doctrine&quot; that allows people to use deadly force in their homes when threatened. Stand your ground extended that right to public settings, which we believe is appropriate. But it did not require the shooter to first attempt to retreat or otherwise avoid the conflict before shooting. Defenders of the law insist it does not allow someone to start a confrontation, but when there are no witnesses, it's impossible to know who confronted whom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of justifiable homicides has tripled since the law was adopted. CNN reports that in the five years before &quot;stand your ground&quot; became law, Florida averaged 12 justifiable homicides a year. In the six years since, FDLE reports the average is 33.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rising number of justifiable shootings was easy to anticipate. We said six years ago that the law gives shooters too much wiggle room without sufficient accountability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement officers say the burden now is much higher to bring charges in questionable killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citizens should be able to defend themselves. But in a society that values life, lethal action should be a last resort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stand your ground has allowed that standard to slip. State leaders should see the issue involves not only gun rights, but respect for life as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems prudent to us to require gun owners to take reasonable -- not extraordinary -- steps to avoid a confrontation. An objective review, without the distracting gun-control histrionics, would give Scott and lawmakers solid evidence to determine how the law needs to be revised.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;As a slain teen's family marches in New York, his city sends a message.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanford City Commission on Wednesday night voted &quot;no confidence&quot; in police Chief Bill Lee Jr., who has been publicly lambasted for his department's handling of the fatal shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Mark McCarty made the motion to fire the chief, who has been on the job less than a year, the Orlando Sentinel reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I take no pleasure in a public flogging of our police chief,&quot; McCarty said before a packed meeting. &quot;But he really should turn in his resignation.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote was 3-2. Commissioners can't fire Lee because he reports to City Manager Norton Bonaparte Jr. But their vote sent a strong signal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonaparte told reporters he would not make a decision about the chief's fate until he learns from an independent law enforcement agency what mistakes police might have made. Lee, who makes $102,000 a year, was not at the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the commission was voting, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, marched in his memory in New York City with hundreds of other people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not going to stop until we get justice,&quot; said Tracy Martin. &quot;My son did not deserve to die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventeen-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was killed Feb. 26 in Sanford. He was returning to a gated community in the city after buying candy at a convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was unarmed, carrying only a bag of Skittles and an iced tea, and was wearing a hooded sweatshirt, called a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was shot to death by a neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, who has not been charged. Zimmerman, 28, has said the teen attacked him and he shot him in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday night, demonstrators chanted &quot;we want arrests&quot; during the Million Hoodie March in Manhattan's Union Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fulton told the crowd: &quot;My heart is in pain, but to see the support of all of you really makes a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has ignited a furor against police Chief Lee and his department in the Orlando suburb of 53,500 people, prompting rallies and a protest in Gov. Rick Scott's office on Tuesday. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said it is sending its community relations service to Sanford this week to &quot;address tension in the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the week, the federal agency opened a civil rights inquiry into the shooting. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is looking into how the investigation was handled by Sanford police, and Seminole County State Attorney Norm Wolfinger said a grand jury will meet April 10 to consider evidence in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Wednesday's meeting, Sanford City Commissioner Patty Mahany called the no-confidence vote against Lee a &quot;knee-jerk reaction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A rush to judgment is wrong,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee, 52, a Sanford native, was hired as chief in May 2011 in the wake of criticism from the black community surrounding the beating of a homeless black man by the son of a Sanford lieutenant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Martin said he and his son's mother found out about the march after arriving in New York City, where they have done interviews about the case. They got in touch with the organizers to say they would attend and speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing of the teen's parents being in the city when the march was happening was &quot;incredible,&quot; said one of the organizers, Daniel Maree, who heard about the case earlier this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was outraged and wanted to do something about it,&quot; Maree said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Martin, asked how he was holding up, said he was trying to stay strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't feel this is the time to break down, even though it's a very troubling time in my life,&quot; he said. &quot;I've told myself, when I get justice for Trayvon, then I'll have my time to break down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something happened at the very cusp of 2003-04 that made me laugh. Made me laugh because my own soft-hearted liberalism is so exquisitely calibrated that when people a tad more liberal than me are discomfited, I rather enjoy it. That new year the Today programme, suffering from a hernia of self-importance, was announcing the results of a special intervention into the world of politics. It was polling listeners on legislation that they wanted to see introduced, with the promise that the winning proposal would be championed by a tame MP, with an eye to being introduced as a Private Member's Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I knew - I just knew - what they were hoping for. Something like the impeachment of T. Blair for crimes to do with Iraq. What they got was something else entirely - a plan to allow homeowners &quot;to use any means to defend their home from intruders&quot; - or a &quot;Tony Martin law&quot;, named after the farmer who in 1999 had shot a retreating teenage burglar dead at his home and had gone to prison for it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subsequent BBC wriggling was droll, but the background swell wasn't. The demand for, in effect, a right to kill intruders, was gaining popularity. &quot;This is wrong, heinously wrong,&quot; Mr Martin himself said, &quot;that you should actually live in fear in your home that if somebody breaks in that, basically, you are going to have the law jump down on you.&quot; The sharp-eyed may notice a small detail about shooting people left out of that sentence, but Mr Martin's supporters were many, especially on what one might call the populist right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The farmer's cause was taken up by MPs, newspapers and even by the National Rifle Association of America, which was campaigning for some similar changes in various American states. As Marion Hammer, the NRA president, put it: &quot;You can't expect a victim to wait and ask, 'Excuse me, Mr. Criminal, are you going to rape me and kill me, or are you just going to beat me up and steal my television?' &quot; Soft-heartedness is all right as a trait, but it is no guide to policy. As Professor Steven Pinker has recently argued, it's possible that - just as the Right said at the time - extreme scepticism in the 1960s about obeying the law and respecting society was partly responsible for a rapid deterioration in American and European crime rates. Among the policies that helped to reverse this deterioration were so-called &quot;zero tolerance&quot; attacks on antisocial behaviour and, yes, the imprisoning of more criminals. The irony of these successes, of course, was that right-wing populists could never acknowledge them. They pushed for more, and in some places they got it. So where did it lead? They led, as it happens, to Florida and the death on February 26 of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. The facts of the case, as we now understand them, are essentially these. Trayvon, a boy aged 17, walking down the street in a housing estate, through which he is taking a short cut from a local shop, holding his phone and a packet of Skittles, finds himself being shadowed by a man in a car. After a while this driver, a complete stranger, stops the car, gets out, accosts the boy, produces a gun and shoots him dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this were to happen in Britain the gunman would be arrested, interrogated and, when it was discovered that his victim was completely unarmed, would probably be charged by the police with murder or manslaughter. But this was Florida. And the reason why the shooter, a man called George Zimmerman, was not arrested or charged or anything, was something called the Stand Your Ground law, passed in 2005 after lobbying from the NRA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll keep this simple. In Britain we require that people do their best to avoid getting into situations where they end up killing other people, even if those others may be badmashes. In public places this means we should try and retreat, if we can, and ask the authorities to take over. What Stand Your Ground did was to loosen restrictions on killing intruders in your own home, get rid of the duty to retreat in public places and give immunity to those using self-defence. After Florida passed this very popular Act in 2005, several other states followed suit and yet others are considering it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, aged 28, was a &quot;watch captain&quot; for the local Neighbourhood Watch. Given that his way of captaining was to drive around the gated community in the town of Sanford looking for baddies while toting a gun, it doesn't seem unfair to call him a vigilante, albeit a vigilante that a neighbour has described as a &quot;congenial, amiable, admirable person&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same neighbour claimed that there had, in the previous 15 months, been eight burglaries in the area carried out by &quot;black youths&quot;. And Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a black youth, with his hood up and moving quickly through the rain. From his car Mr Zimmerman called 911 and spoke to a police dispatcher. &quot;This guy looks like he's up to no good,&quot; he is recorded as saying, &quot;or he's on drugs or something. He's got his hand in his waistband ... and he's a black male.&quot; At this point the police advised Mr Zimmerman not to get out of his car, and they would take over. Mr Zimmerman, who had called 911 nearly 50 times in the previous year, replied: &quot;They always get away.&quot; And got out of his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one saw the struggle, but they heard it. A 911 call from a neighbour captures a voice saying pleadingly: &quot;No, no!&quot; Then Trayvon was shot dead. Mr Zimmerman now claims that the killing was self-defence and the police say that they don't have sufficient evidence to gainsay this claim and to arrest him. It is hard to escape the conclusion that Trayvon was murdered for having been a black boy in the wrong place - and where have we heard that before? This is almost exactly what those worried about a Tony Martin law thought would happen. And it hasn't just happened once. Figures from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement show what has happened to the numbers of claims of &quot;justifiable homicide&quot; since 2005. Before that year and in 2006 they were steady in the 30s. In 2007 they soared to 102 and have stayed at that much higher level. The law is protecting those who have killed when other possibilities were almost certainly available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have had painful argumentative encounters with populists over issues such as immigration and Europe, and worried that policy might one day be determined by &quot;gut feelings&quot;, tabloid headlines and easy applause on a phone-in. Fortunately the British tend to emote one way and decide another. Even if they hold prejudices, they know - as Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family has found out - that it's best not to act on them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin tragedy is shining a national spotlight on &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws in at least 21 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laws -- in places such as Texas, Idaho and Alaska -- allow everyday citizens to use deadly force against someone else if they fear for their life. They also say people do not have to retreat if threatened or attacked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Fla., fatally shot Trayvon as the 17-year-old was walking to his father's home. Zimmerman told police he was attacked by Trayvon and acted in self-defense. He has not been arrested or charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has triggered  public outcry to change or repeal Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want to know how you can kill somebody legally in Florida?&quot; said Arthur Hayhoe of the Florida Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. &quot;Make sure you have no witnesses, hunt the person down and then say you feared for your life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hayhoe said he has about a dozen cases on his desk now similar to Trayvon's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law emerged after a man shot and killed a burglar who officials say was trying to break into the man's RV after Hurricane Ivan in 2005. The man waited months before learning he would not be charged with murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case inspired then-Florida state senator Durell Peaden, a Republican, to introduce a bill dealing with similar situations. State Rep. Dennis Baxley, the bill's House sponsor, told USA TODAY the law empowers people to defend themselves and should not be challenged in the wake of this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time you have an adverse incident, immediately the anti-gun faction will say this law is the problem,&quot; said Baxley, a Republican, adding that violent crime in Florida has dropped since its implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The perpetrators know everyone has the right to defend themselves.  I think that has been a strong deterrent,&quot; Baxley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the law was enacted in 2005, the number of justifiable homicides in Florida has skyrocketed, said state Sen. Oscar Braynon, a Democrat who represents the area in Miami where Trayvon lived with his mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, justifiable homicides  have been slowly rising since 2005. The number in 2010, the last full year measured by the FBI, was 278.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baxley thinks the jump  shows the law is working. &quot;The perpetrator suffered instead of the person they were victimizing,&quot; he said. &quot;That's what those numbers mean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some gun-control advocates say the numbers underscore an increasingly aggressive mentality on the streets, fueled in part by state laws such as Florida's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's part of this increasing effort to push more guns into more public places,&quot; said Daniel Vice of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Braynon and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, have said they support a review of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been great for defense lawyers,&quot; said Richard Rosenbaum, a  Fort Lauderdale attorney. &quot;It has helped a lot of people get off on self-defense that would have been found guilty before 2005.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are joining the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin crusade by the hour now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It feels like an echo from another era - when there was racial injustice in the headlines, when federal troops were dispatched to comb Southern swamps to look for blacks who had vanished. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when lawyers for the NAACP slid into town with briefcases and addresses of safe houses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It feels like the not-so-long-ago '60s, back when getting federal authorities to move quickly was often difficult. But this is a different era, however tragically similar the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin story has multiple layers: a black victim, a Hispanic man who did the shooting in Sanford, Fla. In Washington, the head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, Thomas E. Perez, is Hispanic. The attorney general of the United States, Eric H. Holder Jr., is a black man. The man who occupies the Oval Office, Barack Obama, is an African American.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet, even that arc of progress - while admired - hasn't softened emotions and feelings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It reminds you of Emmett Till,&quot; said Bernadette Pruitt, an associate professor of history at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Tex., who has written about Southern racial history and can't stop thinking of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and his family. &quot;This so-called post-racialism is a figment of our imagination. Race, unfortunately, is still the barometer by which everyone is measured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigating the killing of the 17-year-old Martin, who was black, by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, is now a top priority for the FBI, senior law enforcement officials said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One focus of the FBI's inquiry is whether Zimmerman muttered a racial slur seconds before shooting Martin on Feb. 26, as has been alleged. The FBI is trying to determine whether the audiotape of a 911 dispatch call between Sanford police and Zimmerman can be enhanced with sophisticated equipment that has been used in other cases. If it can, the tape will be transferred to the FBI laboratory at Quantico, one official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enhancing the tape could be crucial to determining whether the shooting is considered a &quot;hate crime&quot; under federal hate-crime laws, according to law enforcement officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Justice officials were scheduled to meet Thursday in Florida with the Martin family and the family's attorney. And Holder on Friday is scheduled to meet with black ministers at the White House, where the Martin case is expected to come up, according to a government official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday in Sanford, the doors of a black church swung open so those in pain could sit, or stand, and give vent to their hurt. Benjamin Jealous, NAACP president, was in town. He was there to deal with the death of an unarmed teenager on a darkening street. Zimmerman has claimed self-defense. The mourners showed up at Olive Street Baptist Church to pray for justice and talk about their run-ins with Southern law enforcement. Anger seemed to outweigh prayer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One after another, they filed to the front of the red-carpeted sanctuary to tell their stories. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Scott said her son was shot to death by police in 2010, a killing that she said was unjustified and remains largely uninvestigated. &quot;I've got animosity in my heart,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lula King, 75, said her grandson was brutally beaten by three correctional officers after he had a seizure while in custody: black eyes, cuts and a &quot;knot on his head bigger than a hen egg.&quot; The men who beat him, wrongfully she said, had never faced discipline. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were hanging on her every word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She continued: &quot;But I'll tell you, God is gonna take care of all of this,&quot; she said to shouts of &quot;Amen!&quot; from the crowd. &quot;Whatever men do wrong, it's gonna come to the light.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stories kept coming, as if it were hoped that they would provide some kind of salve for those who knew and loved Trayvon. People were testifying, a ritual in the black church. The facts about each case were impossible to parse on the spot, and possibly lost forever. But the sentiment behind the stories was unmistakable: Bad things had been done to others with the same promise as Martin. Too many questions had gone unanswered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin has been swooped up this quickly, linked with names from the annals of history. &quot;We can name names all the way from Emmett Till to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; said Hannibal Duncan, 32, who told about black friends who had been profiled repeatedly and, in one case, beaten by police. &quot;At some point, we've got to find some kind of way to stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this same day, Sanford City Manager Norton Bonaparte Jr. posted online a letter addressed to &quot;Fellow Citizens&quot; that tried to answer some of the public's vexing questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why did Zimmerman have a firearm in his role as neighborhood watchman? He was authorized to carry a concealed weapon, according to Bonaparte. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why wasn't Zimmerman arrested the night of the shooting? &quot;By Florida statute, law enforcement was PROHIBITED from making an arrest based on the facts and circumstances they had at the time,&quot; Bonaparte wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By Wednesday evening, the Sanford City Commission had taken a vote of &quot;no confidence&quot; in the police chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's family has said he is not a racist and that he has black friends to prove it. Zimmerman, 28, who grew up in Manassas, in Northern Virginia, has gone into seclusion. But others are speaking up for him. One of them is Frank Taaffe. Taaffe, 55, moved to Zimmerman's Sanford neighborhood in 2006. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it has changed drastically in the years since the housing crisis hit. Prices have fallen. Renters have replaced owners. Neighbors don't know one another as well as they used to. A rash of burglaries had put everyone on edge in the months before Martin was shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had the perfect storm,&quot; Taaffe said. &quot;Everybody was on high alert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taaffe said he certainly doesn't condone Martin's shooting, but he insisted that the demonization of Zimmerman is its own tragedy. He said Zimmerman had helped to prevent burglaries and looked out for his neighbors as much as anyone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George is a good dude. He's a good guy. He cares about this community. He's not a vigilante out looking for trouble. . . . He's not a Bernhard Goetz,&quot; Taaffe said, referring to the New York &quot;subway vigilante&quot; of the 1980s. &quot;He's more like Mr. Peepers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taaffe said that if Zimmerman deserves punishment, it should come through the legal system rather than in the court of public opinion. But the court of public opinion is roiling. The Martin saga has generated discussion from hair salons to the halls of academia, and it has exploded on social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What started as a local news story went national after the news services picked it up, and such influential bloggers as the Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates and the Huffington Post's Trymaine Lee called attention to it early on. Much as with the Kony 2012 campaign, celebrities quickly jumped into the online fray, and the Martin case picked up steam. Hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons may have been the first celebrity to notice the story, sharing a Facebook page in mid-March with thousands of Twitter followers to demand justice for Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin didn't die so we can create a race war. He died so we can promote better understanding,&quot; Simmons wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mia Farrow soon followed suit, telling her followers about the case and using the hashtag #Justice4Trayvon. Within days, that hashtag and others related to the killing started trending. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a Change.org petition demanding justice for Martin languished for weeks, filmmaker Spike Lee's retweet of a link for the petition caused it to take off. Now, Change.org calls the petition demanding Zimmerman's arrest the fastest-growing petition in Internet history. It has more than 900,000 signatures. Radio talk show host Michael Baisden and activist Al Sharpton were among the others who had a hand in galvanizing public interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Wednesday evening, hundreds wearing hooded sweatshirts were marching in New York City in memory of Martin, a demonstration labeled &quot;the Million Hoodie March.&quot; In his call to police, Zimmerman said that the &quot;suspicious&quot; person he saw, who turned out to be Martin, was wearing a hoodie. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pruitt, the associate history professor, said the nation's shock and the attention to the saga can be explained in the simplest terms: &quot;People are caught off guard. They're going 'Wow. This is a kid. From the neighborhood. He wasn't committing a robbery or anything.'&acirc;[#x20ac][#x2c6]&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He liked Skittles, which he had just bought from a local store, along with iced tea. He had a girlfriend. And his dream has been ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is the brutal nature of this,&quot; said former Washington Post reporter Nathan McCall, a lecturer at Emory University who served time in prison himself and has spoken often about young black men and the criminal justice system. (Martin did not have a criminal record; he earned A's and B's in school.) &quot;This sounds like a narrative out of the 1950s, where yet another black man gets randomly killed and the institutions in society that are supposed to respond, don't respond accordingly. They blame the victim.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing is likely to keep the soul-searching discussions around the country going for a while, particularly among blacks. Talks about race, the vulnerability of young black males, small-town justice and gun laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what happened two generations ago in Money, Miss. It was Aug. 24, 1955. A 14-year-old kid, visiting the state on vacation from Chicago, walked into a country store. He saw a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, and supposedly whistled at her. When her husband, Roy Bryant, and his half-brother, J.W. Milam, heard about it, they vowed revenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a few days later they rousted Till from sleep, drove the terrified boy around the dark Delta, shot him in the back of the head and dropped him into a river. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His killers, tried by an all-white jury, were acquitted amid cackling in the courtroom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mamie Till, the child's mother, insisted her son's casket be open. And so, it seems, began a good part of the modern civil rights movement. Hundreds lined up around the Chicago church where the funeral took place, the picture of Emmett in his casket publicized for all the world to see in Jet magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We forget about Southerners,&quot; Pruitt said. &quot;We so often associate black progress with a movement of African Americans out of the South. It isn't shocking to me that the people in Florida said, 'We've got to do something.'&acirc;[#x20ac][#x2c6]&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CIVIL rights leaders in the US have demanded the arrest of a neighbourhood watch helper who went free after shooting dead an unarmed black teenager. The FBI is now investigating the incident in Florida, following a public outcry.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And at a public meeting in the town of Sanford where 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot last month, officials from the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and the Nation of Islam urged residents to remain calm but demand that the shooter, George Zimmerman, be arrested. Mr Zimmerman has not been charged in the February 26 shooting and has said he shot Mr Martin, who was returning to a gated community after buying sweets at a convenience store, in self-defence after Martin attacked him. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 22--NEW YORK -- With a protest Thursday night in Sanford, Florida, led by Rev. Al Sharpton and a rally with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents Wednesday evening in Union Square, New Yorkers are leading an outcry against the handling of the unarmed Florida teen's killing. Thursday afternoon, at least one demand they had in the case was realized. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because my presence has been a distraction,&quot; Sanford, Florida police chief Bill Lee read from a statement at a 3:40 P.M. news conference, &quot;I have come to the decision to temporarily step down as police chief.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move was one of the two main demands of people worldwide who are rallying around the family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. At the time of the chief's resignation, 1.29 million people had signed a petition on http://www.change.org demanding swift justice in the case of the 17 year-old who was carrying only a bag of Skittles and a can of iced tea when he was shot and killed on February 26th by a neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who was never arrested and remains free pending a federal investigation, said he'd acted in self-defense, even though he had been following Martin when he encountered him, against the instructions of a 911 dispatcher Zimmerman had called minutes before the encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family are calling for Zimmerman's arrest. He has not been seen in recent weeks, as publicity in the case intensifies, although police say they know how to contact the 28 year-old of white and Latino descent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Rev. Sharpton expected so many people to attend Thursday night's rally that he changed its venue from a small Sanford church to a large, lakeside park in the Central Florida city of 51,000. Joining him at the rally will be one other prominent New Yorker, former governor David Paterson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rally with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents in Union Square Wednesday evening inspired further protests nationwide, including a walk-out from classes Thursday at a Miami high school in Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While thousands of people nationwide have done like those students and reacted with their feet, far more people are mobilizing in other ways, including the change.org petition and the Million Hoodie March online, where New Yorkers and people worldwide post pictures of themselves wearing hoodies, similar to the hooded sweatshirt Trayvon&nbsp;Martin pulled over his head when he realized Zimmerman was following him minutes before he was killed, according to Trayvon's girlfriend, who was on the phone with him when he struggled with Zimmerman on that fateful February day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss USA 2002 posted her photo with a hoodie over her crown, and former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm tweeted a picture of herself in a hoodie, as well as thousands of others worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FBI investigators are now probing the case, and could possibly make an arrest before a grand jury takes it up. It's scheduled to convene on April 10th.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. (AP) - An unarmed black teenager shot to death by a neighborhood watch captain told his girlfriend moments before he was killed that he was being followed, a lawyer said Tuesday as federal and state prosecutors announced they would investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Oh he's right behind me, he's right behind me again,'&quot; 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin told his girlfriend on his cellphone, the Martin family's attorney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The girl later heard Martin say, &quot;Why are you following me?&quot; Another man asked, &quot;What are you doing around here?'&quot; attorney Benjamin Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phone call that recorded Martin's final moments was disclosed as the U.S. Justice Department opened a federal civil rights probe into the Feb. 26 shooting and the local prosecutor convened a grand jury to investigate. A grand jury will meet April 10 to consider evidence in the case, said Seminole County State Attorney Norm Wolfinger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, has not been charged and said he shot Martin, who was returning to a gated community in Sanford after buying candy at a convenience store, in self-defense after Martin attacked him. Police say Zimmerman is white; his family says he is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She absolutely blows Zimmerman's absurd self-defense claim out of the water,&quot; Crump said of Martin's girlfriend, whose name was withheld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has ignited a furor against the local police department of this Orlando suburb of 53,500 people, sparking rallies and a protest in Gov. Rick Scott's office on Tuesday. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said it is sending its community relations service this week to Sanford to &quot;address tension in the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a town hall meeting on Tuesday, more than 350 people packed into the wood paneled sanctuary of the Allen Chapel AME Church, located in a traditionally black neighborhood of Sanford. A line flowed down steps with others trying to get in and hundreds more gathered outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders from the NAACP, American Civil Liberties Union and the Nation of Islam urged residents to remain calm but demand that Zimmerman be arrested. They also said the town's police chief should step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A local official with the NAACP, which sponsored the meeting, had said the Rev. Al Sharpton was expected to join city leaders at the meeting. Neither the civil rights leader nor city leaders attended the forum. Sanford officials instead went to Washington to meet with a U.S. Department of Justice official about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I stand here as a son, father, uncle who is tired of being scared for our boys,&quot; said Benjamin Jealous, national president of the NAACP. &quot;I'm tired of telling our young men how they can't dress, where they can't go and how they can't behave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents attending the meeting cheered and jumped to their feet when local NAACP leader Turner Clayton Jr. said the U.S. Department of Justice shouldn't just review the investigation but the federal agency also should take over the Sanford Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just the beginning of what is taking place,&quot; Clayton said. &quot;We're going to make sure justice prevails.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When The Associated Press tried to reach the police department Tuesday evening for comment, a dispatcher told a reporter to call in the morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the meeting, Sandra Duval held up a white sign in the sanctuary that said in simple black letters, &quot;Justice for Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want justice for Trayvon because this is a senseless crime,&quot; said Duval, 62, a retired nurse. &quot;That could have been my child or my grandchild.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump told reporters Tuesday that Martin cried out when a man bearing a 9mm handgun came at him. Police said Zimmerman, who was found bleeding from his nose and the back of his head, told authorities he yelled out for help before shooting Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, who was in town from Miami to visit his father in Sanford, called his 16-year-old girlfriend in Miami several times on Feb. 26, including just before the shooting, Crump said. The discovery of the lengthy conversations, including one moments before the shooting, was made over the weekend by Martin's father, who checked his son's cell phone log, Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager told the girl on his way back from the store he'd taken shelter from the rain briefly at an apartment building in his father's gated community, Crump said. Martin then told her he was being followed and would try to lose the person, Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She says: 'Run.' He says, 'I'm not going to run, I'm just going to walk fast,&quot;' Crump said, quoting the girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Martin encountered Zimmerman, the girl thought she heard a scuffle &quot;because his voice changes like something interrupted his speech,&quot; Crump said. The phone call ended before the girl heard gunshots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last call was at 7:12 p.m. Police arrived at 7:17 p.m. to find Martin lying face down on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was handcuffed after police arrived and taken into custody for questioning, but was released by police without being charged. Police have interviewed Zimmerman two times since then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump called the treatment patently unfair and asked if Martin would have received the same treatment if he had been the shooter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not rest until he is arrested. The more time that passes, this is going to be swept under the rug,&quot; Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump said he plans to turn over information about the call to federal investigators; a grand jury in Seminole County is also likely to subpoena the records. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is also involved in the state case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former federal prosecutors said there are limitations to a Justice Department civil rights probe, which typically would involve a sworn law enforcement officer accused of abusing his authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this case, they said, it's not clear whether Zimmerman had any actual law enforcement authority or if the Sanford Police Department did anything improper. Zimmerman had a permit to carry a gun, but it was not required for his neighborhood watch patrol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the community has the feeling that there's some type of cover-up,&quot; said Jeffrey Sloman, former U.S. attorney in Miami. &quot;At least the department's involvement makes sure it gets some review. He wasn't a police officer. I'm sure that this is going to be a tough case to prosecute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities may be hamstrung by a state &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law that allows people to defend themselves with deadly force and does not require a retreat in the face of danger. Asked Tuesday if that law needs change, Republican Gov. Rick Scott said &quot;it's always positive to go back and think about existing laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the town hall meeting in Sanford, Florida Rep. Geraldine Thompson promised the law's repeal would be a top priority for the state legislature's black caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If vigilante justice becomes the norm, will visitors feel comfortable coming to our state?&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An online petition urging local authorities to prosecute Zimmerman has drawn more than 500,000 signatures at website Change.org. About 50 defense attorneys and protesters filled the lobby in the governor's office Tuesday to deliver a letter seeking an independent investigation and a task force to study racial profiling. They applauded when Scott came out of his office to talk to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will make sure justice prevails,&quot; Scott said. &quot;I'm very comfortable that (state law enforcement) is going to do the right thing. They're not going to let somebody do something wrong and get away with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in the Oval Office alongside the Irish leader, Obama expressed his confidence in Kenny's government, saying he believed that it would be able &quot;to get Ireland moving again.&quot; He said the two leaders also discussed the larger issue of European growth, which Obama said would have a positive impact on the U.S. economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously for both our countries, one of the biggest priorities is getting the economy moving in the right direction and putting our people back to work,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Airport officials in Little Rock, Ark., voted unanimously Tuesday to rename Little Rock National Airport in honor of former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, a rare twin billing for the state's former first couple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change won't be official until the Federal Aviation Administration signs off. Adams Field, the designation for the airport's aeronautical operations, will remain the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill and Hillary Clinton not only devoted years of service to Arkansas, but have served the nation as a two-term president, and as first lady, U.S. senator, and secretary of state -- that's a legacy of which all Arkansans can be proud,&quot; said Jim Dailey, chairman of the Little Rock Municipal Airport Commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE US Justice Department is to investigate the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a neighbourhood watch guard following a day of protests over the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 28, claims he shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin last month in self-defence during a confrontation in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman spotted Mr Martin as he was patrolling his area on a rainy evening and called the police emergency service to report a suspicious person. Against the advice of the emergency operator, Zimmerman then followed Mr Martin, who was walking home from a convenience store with a bag of sweets in his pocket. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said in a statement that the FBI and the US Attorney's Office will join in the agency's investigation. &quot;The department will conduct a thorough and independent review of all the evidence and take appropriate action at the conclusion of the investigation,&quot; the agency said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has attracted national attention. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton is expected to join Sanford city leaders in a public meeting to discuss with residents how the investigation is being handled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said its community relations service also will be in Sanford this week to meet with authorities, community officials and civil rights leaders &quot;to address tension in the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, college students around Florida rallied to demand Zimmerman's arrest, as authorities may be hamstrung by a state law that allows people to defend themselves with deadly force. Prosecutors may not be able to charge Zimmerman because of changes to state law in 2005. Under the old law, people could use deadly force in self-defence only if they had tried to run away or otherwise avoid the danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new law, there is no duty to retreat and it gives a Floridian the right &quot;to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force,&quot; if he feels threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Martin's parents and other advocates have said the shooter would have been arrested had he been black. &quot;You would think that Sanford is still in the 1800s claiming that this man can call self-defence for shooting an unarmed boy,&quot; restaurant owner Linda Tillman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gun control advocates said the case is emblematic of permissive laws in Florida, which was among the first states to allow residents to carry concealed weapons. Florida was the first state to pass a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, dubbed a &quot;Shoot First&quot; law by critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, about half of all US states have similar laws, said Brian Malte, legislative director of the Brady Campaign, which is dedicated to preventing of gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's coming to dangerous fruition,&quot; Mr Malte added.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE UNARMED black teenager killed by a white neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida sounded worried about a stranger following him just before he was shot, it was revealed Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, was on the phone with his girlfriend, when she overheard part of the fatal Feb. 26 encounter with George Zimmerman in a Sanford, Fla., gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said, 'Run!' Trayvon said he not (sic) going to run,&quot; the girlfriend said in a 59-second audiotape played for reporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next I heard Trayvon say, 'Well, what you following me for?' &quot; said the 16-year-old girlfriend, whose name was not released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she heard someone asking Trayvon, &quot;What are you doing around here?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next thing I heard, someone push Trayvon because (his) headset just fell,&quot; she said, explaining that the teen's cell phone cut off right before the deadly gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Trayvon's family, insisted the phone call contradicts Zimmerman's account of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This young lady connects the dots. She completely blows Zimmerman's absurd self-defense claim out of the water,&quot; said Crump, renewing demands for Zimmerman's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest twist in the case that has garnered national attention came as the Rev. Al Sharpton said he would go to Florida Thursday to demand justice for Trayvon's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This family has only asked for justice,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;They've not called anybody names. They've acted in a dignified way. They deserve this nation's support, and we're coming to give it to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced its Civil Rights Division has launched an investigation into the killing, and the FBI was monitoring the probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Seminole County grand jury will convene April 10 to hear evidence in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was visiting family in the neighborhood when he was shot while walking back from a store, where he had bought a bag of Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 911 call before the shooting, Zimmerman, 28, told a dispatcher that he was following &quot;a real suspicious guy&quot; who had &quot;something in his hand.&quot; The dispatcher told Zimmerman to stop following the teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later, another 911 call from a neighbor captures someone screaming for help and a single gunshot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's father said he believed the pleas for help were his son's last words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zimmerman told cops it was him yelling for help, Trayvon's father, Tracy Martin, said the voice sounded like his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's heart-wrenching, because those actually were my son's last words,&quot; Tracy Martin told CNN Tuesday. &quot;And to hear his last words being cries of help, is devastating. It tears me apart as a father.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 8 Trayvon's father, Tracy, holds press conference demanding Zimmerman's arrest and saying, &quot;We feel justice hasn't been done.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York has among the country's strictest gun control laws to prevent deaths like that of Trayvon Martin. Pistol-packing America will just have to get used to it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gun advocates have been howling that city police recently busted a few otherwise law-abiding visitors who traveled here with their weapons. It just seemed normal to them to walk crowded streets with loaded and concealed guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uh-uh. Not here. Not when New Yorkers surrender their weapons for the good of all or face jail time. Herewith, then, kudos to Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance for prosecuting medical student Meredith Graves of Tennessee and jeweler Ryan Jerome of Indiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerome inquired about checking his pistol at the Empire State Building in September. Busted. Graves did the same thing at the 9/11 Memorial in December. Busted. Jerome became a mini-cause celebre when supporters called for dismissing charges because he was said to be a former Marine with a distinguished record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Jerome's service history left something to be desired. He stayed in uniform less than 11 months, went absent without leave, admitted using pot and got an &quot;other than honorable&quot; discharge by a summary court-martial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerome and Graves pleaded guilty to misdemeanors and were sent back to states where the right to own a gun can trump the right to live.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case of the unarmed Florida teenager killed last month by a neighborhood watch volunteer - let go by cops after he claimed he shot in self-defense - will at long last go to a county grand jury in early April. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local authorities announced the investigation Tuesday, shortly after the Justice Department stepped in to probe possible civil rights violations. The shooter is Hispanic; the victim was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal action filled a void that for many Americans, particularly blacks, recalled law enforcement inaction in the face of anti-black violence that once plagued the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, though, the poison may not be racism but the psychotic love affair with guns that afflicts too much of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much about the Feb. 26 killing in Sanford, Fla., is not known - but many details have emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was walking to his father's fianc&eacute;e's house from a store, carrying a bag of Skittles and an iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know George Zimmerman had called cops 46 times since January 2011, reporting everything from open windows to disturbances to break-ins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know he saw Trayvon and deemed him suspicious. He told a 911 dispatcher, &quot;this guy looks like he's up to no good or on drugs or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;These a--holes, they always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know Trayvon felt threatened by Zimmerman, who followed him in a sport-utility vehicle, then on foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know Trayvon broke into a run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know the 911 dispatcher asked Zimmerman, &quot;Are you following him?&quot; then added, &quot;Okay, you don't need to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know Zimmerman continued to trail Trayvon, that there was a chase, a struggle and a bullet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we know how cops explained their decision to let Zimmerman go. In 2005, gun-happy Florida enacted the insane Stand Your Ground law. Where citizens had been required to retreat from confrontations, if possible, the statute told Floridians to shoot if they felt threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of criminal defendants claiming justifiable homicide has tripled in the state, and the defense has worked in most cases.So Zimmerman killed an unarmed teenager and police were poised to drop the matter without investigation. The first of these wrongs cannot be reversed. There is still time to correct the second.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A NEIGHBOURHOOD watch co-ordinator who shot dead an unarmed black teenager and escaped arrest under a controversial self-defence law is to face investigation in a case that has provoked outrage throughout America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 28, claimed self-defence after shooting dead 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in the Florida city of Sanford, near Orlando. The state has some of the most relaxed self-defence laws in the country, and police apparently took Mr Zimmerman at his word when he said he feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police failed to talk to Trayvon's 16-year-old girlfriend, who came forward to say that she was speaking on the telephone to him moments before the shooting, and heard him say he was being followed and was frightened. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told him to run, but instead heard Mr Zimmerman challenge Trayvon, who had been to a nearby 7-Eleven shop to buy a packet of Skittles sweets for his younger brother, asking his name and to explain what he was doing in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police also failed to carry out any forensic analysis of Mr Zimmerman's clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager's death has led to accusations of racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black public figures including the film director Spike Lee and members of Congress have led a national campaign calling for Mr Zimmerman's arrest and Trayvon's family say the shooting on Feb 26 would have been investigated further had the victim been white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of people have taken part in protests outside the Florida prosecutors' office and 500,000 have signed an online petition calling for Mr Zimmerman to be investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Martin, Trayvon's father, said: &quot;Can't be self-defence. No way. What's he gonna attack him with? A pack of Skittles? It's like my heart's been snatched out. This guy went home that night and was able to sleep in his bed and that says a lot about the Sanford police department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Justice Department is to open a civil rights inquiry after the Congress Black Caucus described the lack of a proper police investigation as racially motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other officials scrambled to respond to the rising outrage. Florida's state attorney's office said it was reviewing the decision not to prosecute, the FBI began an investigation into the case, and it was announced yesterday that a grand jury hearing would be held next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman has a history of calling the police to complain about intruders at his gated community, reportedly phoning for help 46 times since 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local residents say he took seriously his responsibilities as neighbourhood watch captain, patrolling the estate and warning them to be on their guard against intruders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 911 emergency call he made on the night of the killing shows that the police told him not to follow the person he alleged was an intruder, who he described as &quot;this real suspicious guy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went on: &quot;This guy looks like he's up to no good or he's on drugs or something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's got his hand in his waistband ... and he's a black male.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida operates a Stand Your Ground Law, which gives immunity to those who fight back in self defence. In a statement earlier this month, Sanford police said they had no evidence to doubt Mr Zimmerman's version of events, giving him protection under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stand Your Ground is no defence, however, against a pre-emptive attack, and the Martin family say the fact that Mr Zimmerman ignored police instructions to remain in his car, combined with the girl's evidence that she heard Trayvon being confronted, should have prompted a criminal investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman's family say he is also from a minority background - Hispanic - is not racist, and has a number of black friends.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 21--The young man walked slowly, leisurely, past as I stood and waited for Desi to relieve himself. The young man didn't speak. I didn't speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I walked Desi around the corner and returned just as the young man was heading back, carrying a white plastic bag, probably from the gas station a block away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, Desi barked at him, fiercely, with all of his 25-pound might. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sorry,&quot; I said. &quot;Ferocious dog on board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's OK,&quot; he said. Then he smiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a smile I'd seen on the face of my brother, my nephew, my friends' sons. And I stood, sadly, realizing that I hadn't seen those faces when I first saw him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What I saw was a guy with baggy pants, not in school, not at work, walking down the street in the middle of the day. I was at home recuperating from surgery. So in my mind, he shouldn't have been there. I didn't wonder who he was or whose he was. I wondered where he was going. I was suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the plight of black men, particularly young black men in America. Because of some, others are harassed, feared, tested and destroyed -- and in Florida two weeks ago, killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questionable suspicion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the difference between George Zimmerman and me is that Zimmerman followed and killed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, whom he found suspicious just because he was walking through the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was heading back to the house where his father lives in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. He was carrying a bag of Skittles and an iced tea when his destiny met Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman called 911 to report Trayvon. He had called 911 dozens of times before the night he killed the boy, the Orlando Sentinel reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That last night, he told the police, &quot;this guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something. It's raining and he's just walking around looking at houses. He's just staring, looking at all the houses. Now he's coming toward me. He's got his hand in his waistband. Something's wrong with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Zimmerman did not know then was that Trayvon also made a call to his girlfriend to tell her some guy was following him. Trayvon was scared. She advised him to run. Trayvon said no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told the dispatcher, &quot;He's coming to check me out. He's got something in his hands. I don't know what his deal is. Can we get an officer over here? These assholes always get away. Shit, he's running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman got out of his car to chase Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you following him?&quot; the dispatcher asked. Zimmerman, according to the Sentinel, calmly responded, &quot;Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;OK, we don't need you to do that,&quot; said the dispatcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman chased Trayvon anyway. At that point, he was no frightened resident or concerned neighborhood watch captain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was a hunter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was after his prey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he was ignoring the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WWB justifies murder?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses later heard a boy's screams, and a single shot -- although police would later say the screams were undetermined and could have been Zimmerman. Yeah, right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses came out to find Zimmerman on top of the 17-year-old kid he has since confessed to shooting to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not at his house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not during the commission of a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But because he was WWB, walking while black, and &quot;these assholes always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford police decided that a Florida law that allows residents to keep themselves and their property safe applies to a man who disobeyed police, hunted down a child and killed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if the city of Sanford and state of Florida won't do what they should have already done -- arrest Zimmerman and charge him with first-degree murder -- then the U.S. Justice Department, which announced that it is investigating the case, will have to do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to every vigilante, concerned resident, or neighborhood watch captain in America, here is the lesson: When you see a kid walking down the street, ask him how he is, and see if he smiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you do, you may just see your son or your nephew or just another kid on the way back from the store, carrying Skittles and an iced tea. If you don't, try harder. That young man may just be afraid of you, too.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After mounting public outrage over the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old black teenager by a crime-watch volunteer, a grand jury will consider whether the 28-year-old shooter, George Zimmerman, should be charged.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Zimmerman wasn't arrested in connection with the Feb. 26 shooting because he claimed self-defence and police in Sanford, near Orlando, said they had no evidence to dispute his version of events. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In announcing the grand jury Tuesday, Florida State Attorney Norm Wolfinger, shifted the decision-making in what has become a racially-charged case to ordinary citizens. His decision, a day after the FBI and U.S. Department of Justice also decided to open an investigation into the case, may defuse the mounting public anger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also emerged Tuesday that Mr. Martin was talking to friend on his cell phone as Mr. Zimmerman approached. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The call, disclosed by Ben Crump, a lawyer representing the Martin family, suggests the teenager was worried about the approaching Mr. Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;She knew details about what went on because he was telling her,&quot; Mr. Crump said. According to the lawyer, the girl said, &quot;I asked Trayvon to run, and he said he was going to walk fast. I told him to run, but he said he was not going to run,&quot; Phone records show the call between the two ended four minutes before police arrived to find Mr. Martin dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other calls to 911 recorded sounds of an altercation, then a gunshot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the fevered fears of critics who warned of gun battles at check-out counters and showdowns in parks haven't been realized, the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a gun-toting, crime watch volunteer has put the 'Stand Your Ground' law on public trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 2005 law swept aside the limits of a centuries-old legal principle that &quot;an Englishman's home is his castle&quot; and redefined when a citizen could kill another rather than back away from a confrontation. The so-called 'castle doctrine,' long part of English common law and fundamental to key elements of the U.S. Constitution, includes not only a 'right to defend' but also corresponding 'duty to retreat.' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other words, a citizen facing a threat in his home can use deadly force in self-defence. But the same right of self-defence - at least until Florida's law - didn't apply in public spaces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Backed by the powerful National Rifle Association and passed overwhelmingly by Florida's legislature, the 'Stand Your Ground' law allowed citizens to use lethal force in self-defence in almost all public spaces. They no longer had to back off from confrontations. There was no 'obligation to retreat' from confrontation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seventeen other states have since passed similar laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Martin's death has focused public attention on the sweeping new scope of using lethal force in self defence. But it wasn't the first. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Orlando Sentinel has cited a handful. One was the shooting death of an unarmed man in a park near Tampa in a dispute over skateboarding rules. A judge is currently considering whether the shooter merely 'stood his ground.' </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in the state of Florida are under public and federal pressure to arrest a neighbourhood watch captain who remains at liberty more than three weeks after he shot dead an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has caused a national outcry, since George Zimmerman, 28, claims that he has committed no crime and acted in self-defence in killing Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, citing his right under Florida's so-called &quot;stand your ground&quot; law permitting individuals &quot;to meet force with force, including deadly force&quot; if attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release of 911 tapes reveal that, before the shooting, Zimmermann followed Martin as the latter walked home from a shop, and approached him on the grounds that he appeared suspicious, despite a warning by a police dispatcher not to do so. Police say there are no witnesses to contradict Zimmerman's claim that the shooting was in self-defence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But yesterday the Martin family's lawyer revealed that the teenager's girlfriend had been talking to him on his mobile at the time, and had come forward with an account which, they say, contradicts his killer's version of events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US justice department has stepped into the case, beginning an investigation along with the FBI; the department has also sent members of its community relations service to Sanford to try to defuse tensions, following demonstrations outside a courthouse by college students. Faced with a petition on the change.org website signed by almost 500,000 people, the state authorities intervened yesterday, announcing that a grand jury would hear evidence next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference yesterday the Martins' lawyer, Benjamin Crump, described how the unnamed girl, a minor, who was so traumatised by Martin's death that she was taken to hospital from his wake, had been talking to the victim in Sanford, near Orlando, on his mobile phone in the minutes leading up to his death, and heard an altercation with his killer. The girlfriend, who had been at home in Miami, conversed with Martin as he returned to the home of his father's girlfriend in a gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said he told her over the phone that a stranger was following him, according to an affidavit she has given. Martin then tried unsuccessfully to get away. &quot;He says (into his phone), 'Oh he's right behind me, he's right behind me again,'&quot; Crump said: &quot;She says: 'Run.' He says, 'I'm not going to run, I'm just going to walk fast.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She then heard Martin saying, &quot;Why are you following me&quot;, and another voice saying, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; The girl told Crump she thought she heard Zimmerman push Martin &quot;because his voice changes like something interrupted his speech&quot;. She heard an altercation and then the call was cut off, Crump said. When police arrived a minute later, at 7.17pm, Martin was lying dead in the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the call emerged, there were no witnesses to what happened. Now, Crump told reporters, the girl's evidence &quot;connected the dots&quot;. Phone logs also showed that Martin was on the phone throughout his trip to the convenience store to buy sweets and drink, appearing to disprove Zimmerman's claim that he had been acting suspiciously. &quot;This claim that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was the aggressor is preposterous, and can't be allowed to stand,&quot; said Crump. &quot;Arrest Zimmerman. Arrest him today. &quot;(Martin) was just a kid trying to get home from the store and trying to get out of the rain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The episode began as Zimmerman was patrolling in his SUV. A series of 911 calls from him and from people in the gated community culminate in a faint voice in the distance pleading for help. A gunshot is heard, and then silence. Beforehand Zimmerman had got out of his vehicle with his licensed pistol, and a worried dispatcher asked: &quot;Are you following him? OK, you don't need to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who is studying criminal justice, was arrested once in 2005 on charges of attacking a police officer and resisting arrest; the case was dropped. Trayvon had no criminal record. He was suspended from his Miami high school for 10 days in February, which is why he was visiting his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida was the first state to pass the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law in 2005, called a &quot;shoot first&quot; law by gun control advocates. About half of all US states now have similar laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticism of Sanford police department escalates as protesters continue call for killer's arrest amid mounting evidence <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida police chief investigating the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed black teenager fatally shot by a self-appointed neighbourhood watch volunteer, is facing calls by civil rights leaders for his resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police chief Bill Lee, of Sanford police, has insisted he carried out a &quot;fair and thorough&quot; investigation of the killing and that he cannot arrest George Zimmerman because he has told police he shot the teenager in self-defence and there was no evidence to contradict his account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticism of the police investigation is focused on the failure to arrest Zimmerman, but also on the failure to test him for drugs or alcohol, a common practice in homicide investigations, in particular because they tested the teenager after his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are also facing questions over their failure to reach Martin's girlfriend in Miami, who was talking to him on his cellphone as he was being followed by Zimmerman in the minutes before his death. She said his last words were &quot;What are you following me for?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's family say the girlfriend's testimony of the call undermines Zimmerman's self-defence claims. There have also been reports that police &quot;corrected&quot; witnesses who say they heard the boy screaming for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, police admitted to ABC News they may have missed a potential racial slur on the tape of Zimmerman's 911 call to report Martin's &quot;suspicious behaviour&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Jealous, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People told Miami television channel NBC6 that federal authorities should take over Lee's department because of a &quot;pattern and practice of discrimination&quot; which include cases that precede Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a highly-charged town hall meeting at Allen Chapel AME Church in Sanford on Tuesday night, Jealous told the 350-strong crowd: &quot;Any chief who would so allow his officers to so mishandle a situation like this has to go. We will ensure that there is a new chief here in Sanford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds more gathered outside, chanting &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The calls for Lee's resignation came as Florida governor Rick Scott, who attended a meeting with black lawyers and civil rights activists on Tuesday night, said it was time to revisit the state's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law. This allows people to use deadly force if they feel endangered, without requiring them to retreat from the threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there's something wrong with the law that's in place, I think it's important we address it. I'm going to look at it. If what's happening is it's being abused, that's not right. We all want to live in a safe place,&quot; Scott told the Palm Beach Post News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York, a &quot;one million hoodie&quot; march is planned for Wednesday evening, with Martin's parents Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin due to attend, according to NBC New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A black person in a hoodie isn't automatically 'suspicious',&quot; says the event's Facebook page, which calls on people to &quot;show the world we are all Trayvon&quot; by uploading a photograph of themselves on social media sites wearing hoodies with the hashtag #millionhoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 800,000 people have signed a petition on the Change.org website calling for Zimmerman to be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set up by Martin's parents, it describes him as &quot;our hero&quot;. They said: &quot;At the age of nine, Trayvon pulled his father from a burning kitchen, saving his life. He loved sports and horseback riding. At only 17 he had a bright future ahead of him with dreams of attending college and becoming an aviation mechanic. Now that's all gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local pastors and members of the Florida Civil Rights Association planned a rally outside the Florida Division of Licensing in Orlando to demand that Zimmerman's concealed weapons permit be revoked, according to the Orlando Sentinel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group leader J Willie David earlier claimed the 28-year-old man is a &quot;clear threat to public safety&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case is now the subject of three investigations, including the Sanford police department. The US justice department, along with the FBI, launched an inquiry this week, after the case garnered national attention. On Tuesday the Florida state attorney for Seminole and Brevard counties announced that a grand jury would hear evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Justice Department has opened an investigation into the shooting of a black teenager in Sanford, Florida, by a neighbourhood watch captain following mounting public pressure including an international Twitter campaign.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 26, Trayvon Martin, 17, was shot dead by George Zimmerman, who was patrolling a gated community in his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman had spotted Mr Martin walking home from buying candy. He called police and reported what he described  a real suspicious guy . </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Martin was shot dead after Mr Zimmerman confronted the teenager, despite police telling him not to approach nor follow the 17-year-old.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But police, citing Florida s controversial  Stand Your Ground  law, declined to arrest Zimmerman, and turned the case over to prosecutors, where it remained under review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, following public outcry over the killing, the Justice Department s Civil Rights Division and the FBI have confirmed they are to open an investigation into the shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It came after more than 435,000 people, many alerted by tweets from celebrities including movie director Spike Lee, musician Wyclef Jean, and actress Mia Farrow signed a petition on Change.org, a social action website, which called for the arrest of Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners are also calling for the repeal of the Stand Your Ground law, which is in effect in at least 16 other states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, enacted by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in 2005, allows a potential crime victim  in fear of great bodily injury  to use deadly force in public places, and builds upon legislation that permits the use of deadly force in defense of  hearth and home .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, a review by Florida s St Petersburg Times found that reports of justifiable homicides had tripled since 2005. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later, the unarmed black teenager was lying fatally injured in the grass, in a shooting that has sparked growing outrage and accusations of institutional racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly a month after the incident, the gunman - 28-year-old George Zimmerman - has not been arrested, let alone charged, shielded by a Florida law protecting gun owners. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As details of Trayvon's death on 26 February have been pieced together by US news outlets, public outrage has steadily mounted, and late on Monday, the US Justice Department agreed to open an investigation into the death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal department's civil rights division, along with the FBI, will attempt to establish how detectives concluded that a slight, 17-year-old boy represented a mortal threat to his stocky killer, who had taken to mounting night-time patrols of a gated community in Sandford, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their independent review comes after a petition calling for Mr Zimmerman's prosecution attracted more than 550,000 signatures and was endorsed by a slew of left-leaning celebrities, including Spike Lee, Wyclef Jean, and Mia Farrow. Demonstrations are being held across Florida's university campuses while civil rights leader Al Sharpton was due to arrive in Sandford, a commuter city north of Orlando, last night, to discuss the case's increasingly ugly racial overtones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, originally described by police as a white male, has long styled himself as a &quot;neighbourhood watch co-ordinator&quot;. He spotted Trayvon while patrolling the gated community in an SUV. The teen, who was staying at the nearby home of his father's girlfriend, had visited a local convenience store during half-time of a televised basketball game and was walking home. Since it was raining, he wore a hooded top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something,&quot; Mr Zimmerman told 911. &quot;These assholes, they always get away.&quot; Then, against the advice of an operator, decided to confront Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ensuing altercation, several neighbours heard cries for help, followed by the sound of the fatal gunshot. Police swiftly arrived on the scene, but declined to make an arrest, after Mr Zimmerman claimed that he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That decision is now the subject of widespread derision, along with claims that white police officers either botched their investigation or deliberately moulded it to dovetail with the suspect's version of events. Several witnesses have, for example, said they heard a boy calling for help, and were shocked to hear the police describe those cries as Mr Zimmerman's. Tapes of the 911 call have suggested that he acted aggressively. Forensics indicate that Trayvon was initially approached from behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents are doggedly campaigning for a proper investigation into the shooting. His mother, Sybrina Fulton, appeared on television on Monday to allege that her son was killed because Mr Zimmerman was: &quot;reacting to the colour of his skin&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim's girlfriend revealed yesterday that she had been speaking on the phone to him immediately before the attack. &quot;Why are you following me?&quot; she heard him ask Mr Zimmerman. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; came the reply. After that, his phone was apparently thrown to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as inflaming race-relations, the killing has shed uncomfortable light on a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law introduced by Republicans in Florida in 2005 with the intention of protecting gun owners. It allows a crime victim who is &quot;in fear of great bodily injury&quot; to use deadly force in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">CAUGHT ON TAPE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">'THIS GUY LOOKS LIKE HE'S UP TO NO GOOD'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anger that followed the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin three weeks ago exploded after the release of the 911 tapes of the incident earlier this week. They reveal that the alleged gunman, George Zimmerman, had followed the teenage victim despite being advised not to by the operator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman can be heard on the tape calling police to report a suspicious character in the gated community in Sanford, Florida, where he lived. &quot;This guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something,&quot; he tells the dispatcher. &quot;These a**holes, they always get away,&quot; he adds. Mr Zimmerman tells the operator that he is following Trayvon, after which the operator tells him not to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second 911 call, this time from a neighbour who witnessed a struggle between the two men, could also prove crucial to any future investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighbour says she can hear &quot;someone screaming outside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know why. I think they're yelling help but I don't know,&quot; she says. The sound of a struggle can be heard, followed by gunshots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing the tapes, Trayvon's father, Martin, said that he was &quot;positive&quot; that it is his son's voice that can be heard screaming for help in the neighbours' calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's heart-wrenching, because those actually were my son's last words,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

Mr Zimmerman has not been charged in the February 26 shooting and has said he shot Mr Martin, who was returning to a gated community after buying sweets, in self-defence. The US Justice Department's civil rights division has opened a probe into the shooting. But authorities may be hamstrung by a state Stand Your Ground law that allows people to defend themselves with deadly force and does not require retreat in the face of danger. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI -- Seven years after Florida adopted its sweeping self-defense law, the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager, has put that law at the center of an increasingly angry debate over how he was killed and whether law enforcement has the authority to charge the man who killed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, called Stand Your Ground, is one of 21 such laws around the country, many of them passed within the last few years. In Florida, it was pushed heavily by the National Rifle Association but opposed vigorously by law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It gives the benefit of the doubt to a person who claims self-defense, regardless of whether the killing takes place on a street, in a car or in a bar -- not just in one's home, the standard cited in more restrictive laws. In Florida, if people feel they are in imminent danger from being killed or badly injured, they do not have to retreat, even if it would seem reasonable to do so. They have the right to ''stand their ground'' and protect themselves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is precisely the question in the case: Was the gunman, George Zimmerman, 28, a white Hispanic crime watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., in imminent danger and acting in self-defense during his encounter with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, as he asserts?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the three weeks since Trayvon, 17, a well-liked high school student from Miami with no criminal record, was killed, public protests have grown larger and louder, and so have calls for Mr. Zimmerman's arrest. The Police Department in Sanford, near Orlando, said that under the law, it had no call to bring charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But late Monday, the Department of Justice said it had opened an inquiry into the shooting. It will run parallel with one announced on Tuesday by the state attorney in Seminole County, who said a grand jury would be convened. State attorneys use grand juries in cases when they cannot make a clear independent call, or when a case is explosive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, Trayvon's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, have issued pleas for law enforcement to take action, and social media campaigns, chiefly on the Web site change.org., have pushed for the justice system to act. Celebrities like Spike Lee and John Legend have joined the effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, who is coming to Sanford for a rally this week, said he was planning to raise awareness on the law, which he said encourages vigilante justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''People can't take the law in their own hands,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday evening in Sanford, hundreds gathered along the wooden pews and red carpeted floors of the Allen Chapel A.M.E. Church as community leaders and residents gave testimonials of police harassment and listened to N.A.A.C.P. officials criticize the law. The spirited crowd called for the arrest of Mr. Zimmerman and the ouster of Sanford's police chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The line has been drawn in the sand,'' said Turner Clayton, head of the Seminole County N.A.A.C.P. office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer for Trayvon's parents, Benjamin Crump, said at a news conference on Tuesday that Trayvon was speaking to his girlfriend on his cellphone minutes before he was shot, telling her that a man was following him as he walked home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon told his girlfriend he was being confronted, Mr. Crump said. She told him to run, and he said he would ''walk fast.'' Trayvon was headed to the home of his father's girlfriend after a visit to a convenience store, carrying Skittles and a can of iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon asked, ''Why are you following me?'' Mr. Crump said. The girl then heard a faraway voice ask, ''What are you doing around here?'' Mr. Crump added. Then Trayvon's voice falls away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''She completely blows Zimmerman's self-defense claim out of the water,'' Mr. Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman had reported a ''suspicious'' person to 911 a shortly before the encounter, saying a black male was checking out the houses and staring at him. Mr. Zimmerman, a criminal justice major, often patrolled the neighborhood. He had placed 46 calls to 911 in 14 months, for reports including open windows and suspicious persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 911 call, Mr. Zimmerman, using an expletive and speaking of Trayvon, said they ''always get away.'' The 911 dispatcher told him not to get out of the car and said the police were on their way. Mr. Zimmerman was already outside. A dispute began. Mr. Zimmerman told the police that Trayvon attacked him and that he fired in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents say they are sure they can hear Trayvon pleading for his life on the 911 tapes. Several witnesses who heard the encounter agree it was Trayvon who was screaming. But Mr. Zimmerman told the police that was his voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police said they have found no evidence to dispute Mr. Zimmerman's claim of self-defense. Without that, the Stand Your Ground law makes it hard to make an arrest, and for prosecutors to charge and bring to trial. The state attorney is now in charge of the case and is being assisted by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Rick Scott, asked about the law at a press gathering on Tuesday, said that he did not think the law was unfair but that it merited a close look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Any time we see something like that we have to review and make sure we're not giving people the opportunity to use the law unfairly,'' he said. ''You want to do everything you can to make sure this doesn't happen again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida prosecutors say the number of defendants who claim self-defense -- even when it should not apply -- has jumped noticeably since the law was passed in 2005. It has been used judiciously and fairly in many cases, where it was clearly self-defense. Other cases have left prosecutors scratching their heads. The law also prevents a person shooting in self-defense from being sued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Self-defense is now used more widely than it was under the old law,'' said William Eddins, Pensacola's state attorney and president of the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association. ''It is a very broad law in terms of the availability of the defendant to try to take advantage of this law. It has created more litigation for the state in cases involving violence and in murder cases, in particular.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state attorney in Tallahassee, Willie Meggs, who fought the law when it was proposed, said: ''The consequences of the law have been devastating around the state. It's almost insane what we are having to deal with.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is increasingly used by gang members fighting gang members, drug dealers battling drug dealers and people involved in road rage encounters. Confrontations at a bar are also common: someone looks at someone the wrong way or bothers someone's girlfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the old law, a person being threatened with a gun or a knife had a duty to try to get away from the situation, if possible. Now that person has a right to grab a gun (or knife, or ice pick, as happened in one case) and use it, without an attempt to retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Meggs said he lost a case on appeal that was clearly not a self-defense shooting. The attacker, who was in a car, could have driven away. The victim was unarmed but had angered the attacker earlier in the night, and then he had leaned into the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It happens with rival gangs, too. ''It puts us in a posture that, if you and I had words, and I said get your gun and I will meet you on the street, we can have a shootout in the street and the winner is standing his ground,'' Mr. Meggs said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigating the cases, prosecutors say, is time-consuming. ''You have to be very careful and very thorough,'' Mr. Eddins said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless there are good witnesses and clear-cut physical evidence, the self-defense homicide cases are often murky and hard to sort out, prosecutors say. The gunman's side of the story usually prevails because the victim is not alive to challenge the claim. So rather than let a jury decide a self-defense case, which is mostly what happened under the old law, prosecutors sometimes must drop the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The person who is alive always says, 'I was in fear that he was going to hurt me,' '' Mr. Meggs said. ''And the other person would say, 'I wasn't going to hurt anyone.' But he is dead. That is the problem they are wrestling with in Sanford.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, the situation is particularly explosive because of the state's expansive gun-rights laws. Most people in the state who are not felons can buy guns in Florida, and a relatively large percentage do, with some choosing to keep them in their cars. The National Conference of State Legislatures has found laws in nearly every state that allow the use of deadly force, to a greater or lesser degree, in self-defense, and in defense of property and premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This wave of laws started back in the 1980s,'' said Jon Kuhl, a spokesman for the organization. Laws like Florida's, which give broad license to use deadly force and to claim self-defense, in many cases beyond the home, are a more recent phenomenon, he said. Some of the more lenient ones are in Southern states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, says that his organization tracks laws in 21 states that extend the self-defense doctrine beyond the home. The usual label for such laws -- ''stand your ground'' -- is politically charged, he said, suggesting that a more apt label would be ''Shoot first, ask questions later.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laws like the one in Florida allow situations like the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin killing, he said. ''We're heartbroken, but we're not surprised.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US officials are investigating the fatal shooting of an unarmed black Florida teenager by a white neighbourhood watch volunteer that has sparked national outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, was shot on February 26 in a gated community in central Florida by a neighbourhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, who later was released by police after claiming he acted in self-defence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Martin&quot;s family, said Martin had put on a hoodie after getting caught in the rain and was not aware he was being followed by Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He&quot;s just a kid trying to get home from the store and get out of the rain. That&quot;s it, nothing else,&quot; Crump told a news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Martin&quot;s 16-year-old girlfriend was on the phone with him at the time and heard most of the altercation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What Zimmerman said is completely contradicted by the phone log,&quot; Crump added, urging authorities to arrest the neighbourhood watchman for killing Martin &quot;in cold blood&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to ABC News, the girlfriend recalled that Martin &quot;said this man was watching him, so he put his hoodie on. He said he lost the man&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I asked Trayvon to run, and he said he was going to walk fast. I told him to run, but he said he was not going to run,&quot; added the girlfriend, who was not identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said its Civil Rights Division plans to &quot;conduct a thorough and independent review of all of the evidence&quot;. The division examines cases in which discrimination on the basis of race, sex, disability, religion, and national origin are suspected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI is also investigating the racially charged killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin&quot;s case is heading to a grand jury, where a diverse group of citizens will decide whether to bring charges against Zimmerman, according to the local state attorney&quot;s office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I share in the desire of the family and the community to accurately collect and evaluate all the facts surrounding the tragic death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Norman Wolfinger, state attorney for Brevard and Seminole counties, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A neighbourhood watch co-ordinator who shot dead an unarmed black teenager and escaped arrest under a controversial self-defence law is to face investigation in a case that has provoked outrage across America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 28, claimed self-defence after shooting 17-yearold Trayvon Martin in the Florida town of Sanford. The state has some of the most relaxed self-defence laws in the country, and police apparently took Zimmerman at his word when he said he feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police failed to talk to Trayvon's 16-year-old girlfriend, who came forward to say that she was speaking on the telephone to him moments before the shooting, and heard him say he was being followed and was frightened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told him to run, but instead heard Zimmerman challenge Trayvon, who had been to a nearby 7-Eleven shop to buy a packet of Skittles sweets for his younger brother, asking his name and to explain what he was doing in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black public figures and members of Congress have led a national campaign calling for Zimmerman's arrest and Trayvon's family say the shooting on Feb. 26 would have been investigated further had the victim been white.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a surprise meeting with black lawyers and civil activists Tuesday, Gov. Rick Scott said the shooting of an unarmed 17-year-old by a neighborhood watch volunteer raised concerns about the state's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law that critics say lets some get away with murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott unexpectedly joined the group of 50 protesters in the lobby of his office Tuesday, saying lawmakers should perhaps revisit the first-in-the-nation law after the investigation into last month's shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the subject of national outrage and a potential racial powder keg, is complete. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there's something wrong with the law that's in place, I think it's important we address it. I'm going to look at it. If what's happening is it's being abused, that's not right. We all want to live in a safe place,&quot; Scott said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impromptu meeting came alongside demands from Democratic lawmakers to clarify the law, passed in 2005, which allows individuals to use deadly force when they feel threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in a gated community in Sanford, who is white, says he acted in self-defense during a Feb. 26 confrontation when he shot Martin, who is black. Local officials have not charged him with any crime, sparking a national outcry from black leaders and civil rights activists who accuse Orlando-area prosecutors and police officials of racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seminole County State Attorney Norm Wolfinger announced Tuesday a grand jury will investigate the shooting next month. Late Monday night, Scott ordered the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to cooperate with the Sanford Police Department inquiry. The U.S. Department of Justice also is investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celebrities including Cher, Mia Farrow, Wyclef Jean and Spike Lee have joined in the protests over Martin's shooting and are participating in an online petition drive demanding that Wolfinger charge Zimmerman with murder. Nearly 500,000 had signed onto the petition drive as of Tuesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Sharpton plans to meet with community leaders in Sanford on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's killing cast an unwelcome spotlight on Florida's &quot;Castle Doctrine&quot; law, promoted by the National Rifle Association and which became a model for other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Chris Smith, a lawyer, said he plans to file legislation to close what he called a gray area in the law. &quot;The language is vague, so what we want to do is point out that you cannot initiate contact,&quot; said Smith, D-Fort Lauderdale, who voted against the bill while in the Florida House in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith said justifiable homicide has increased threefold since the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law went into effect seven years ago, with many of the victims black. &quot;What it's done is, it has emboldened those who are sometimes looking for confrontation because they realize they have the shield of this law. This is a classic case of, if it's my word against yours and you happen to be dead, there's no way of knowing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens, on Tuesday asked Senate President Mike Haridopolos, R-Merritt Island, to hold legislative hearings about how the law has been used by law enforcement, prosecutors, public defenders and defense lawyers. Martin's mother lives in Braynon's senate district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This law was never intended to be a blanket of protection for neighborhood vigilantes who think that they can bypass law enforcement instructions and shoot anyone they see fit,&quot; said Braynon, a lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martin shooting is the latest in a string of controversial cases in which shooters have invoked the law in their defense, including at least six Palm Beach County cases in which killers were not punished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These problems are racial profiling, the abuse of police discretion and the abuse of prosecutorial discretion. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is dead because of racial profiling,&quot; attorney Mutaquee Akbar told Scott, reading from a prepared letter. &quot;George Zimmerman is walking free today because of this abuse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott replied: &quot;I'll do everything I can to make sure justice prevails.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the sponsors of the 2005 measure defended the law, citing reports that Zimmerman ignored the advice of a 911 operator who told Zimmerman to stay away from Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Invariably when there's any adverse incident, it's open season for anti-gun factions to disseminate this idea that there's something wrong with 'stand your ground,' &quot; said Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, who sponsored the measure. &quot;There's nothing in 'stand your ground' that authorizes anyone to pursue and confront an individual. That's the problem in this case. ... Let them do a bill about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racial tension surrounding the Sanford shooting should not take away from the positive results the law has had by allowing potential victims to protect themselves, Baxley said. &quot;It has stopped a lot of victimization from occurring. And that's what I get thanked for every week almost from someone. I think it defends those people. It defends everyone. If they're under violent attack they have the authority to stop that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer, who pushed for the law, agreed. She said the call for action is premature because the law allows an arrest to take place after an investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So for law enforcement to rush to judgment, just because they are being stampeded by emotionalism, would be a violation of law,&quot; she said. &quot;This law is not about one incident. It's about protecting the right of law-abiding people to protect themselves when they are attacked.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A FTER WEEKS of agitation by an outraged community, the U.S. Justice Department and a Florida prosecutor are finally asking why a town-watch volunteer gunned down a kid armed with nothing more than a soft drink and a bag of Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question before them is whether George Zimmerman was simply exercising his right of self-defense under Florida's expansive &quot;Stand Your Ground Law&quot; when he shot and killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, on Feb. 26 in a neighborhood that Zimmerman patrolled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What they won't be considering is whether Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had the right to stand</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> his</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ground. Because in Florida, Pennsylvania and 25 other states that have enacted these &quot;shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later&quot; laws, &quot;justice&quot; sides with the last man standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, Florida's law and the Castle Doctrine law that Pennsylvania's Gov. Corbett signed in July make it all but impossible to pursue criminal or civil cases against people who use deadly force in self-defense. Both laws allow a person who feels threatened in his home or place of work or car to shoot and kill without the need to retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The impact of the Florida law was as swift as it was predictable. Since it was passed in 2005, the number of &quot;justified&quot; shooting deaths has tripled in Florida, according to a 2010 review by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">St. Petersburg Times</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">Times'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> investigation revealed that charges were brought in only eight of the 65 shooting deaths in which Florida's self-defense law was cited. All but one ended in acquittals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So George Zimmerman has as much to fear from these investigations as he did from the unarmed kid he shot down on that rainy night in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the show must go on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. Justice Department's role in this unfolding morality play will be to determine whether Zimmerman was guilty of a hate crime. While the feds are engaged in this pointless pursuit, county prosecutors will convene a grand jury on April 10 to decide whether to haul him up on homicide charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I don't believe there is a court in America that can say with certainty that Zimmerman was motivated by race hatred. Nor can the Justice Department meet the ridiculously rigorous legal standard to prove that he specifically intended to deprive Martin of his civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I've never been a fan of hate- crime laws. Why ask a jury to probe a defendant's psyche? If he did it, he should be punished, whether he's a racist or just a garden-variety criminal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there is a race angle in this story. I can't help wondering which way the wheels of justice would be turning if Martin had fired first. Where do you think he would be now if they had wrestled over the gun and Zimmerman had been killed in the struggle?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Would the most permissive self-defense law in America have been wide enough to cover an unarmed 17-year-old black kid in a hoodie who was walking through a predominantly white neighborhood at night?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I doubt it. The story would have been about how a pillar of his community was killed in action as he was standing sentinel in a neighborhood that had been repeatedly victimized by kids like this. Who was this kid? What was he doing there? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would be facing homicide charges in a state that has the most-used death chamber in America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Check the list of those people who have left Florida's death house in boxes. You will find more Trayvon&nbsp;Martins than George Zimmermans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Would justice have sided with the last man standing if he had been a black kid in a predominantly white neighborhood and he was standing over the body of a respected figure in the community?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What do you think?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As outrage mounts over the killing last month of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a crime watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., it's welcome news that the U.S. Department of Justice and a grand jury under a state prosecutor will investigate the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager was shot dead Feb. 26 in a gated community north of Orlando while walking to the home of his father's girlfriend with nothing more dangerous than Skittles and a can of iced tea in hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 28 and white, said he shot the teenager, who was black, in self-defense. Before the shooting, Mr. Zimmerman, who was on patrol in a neighborhood that had seen a recent rash of break-ins, told a police dispatcher on a 911 call that the youth looked suspicious. The dispatcher told Mr. Zimmerman that he should not confront or follow the young man and that police would investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The volunteer ignored the warning and exited his vehicle with a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol that he is licensed to carry. What happened next is the source of much speculation and has led to a national outcry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbors overheard parts of the confrontation, but so far no eyewitness has come forward. During frantic 911 calls, they reported screams of a boy seconds before shots were fired. Mr. Zimmerman told police that the teen attacked him from behind and that the screams were his, not Mr. Martin's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An attorney for Mr. Martin's family said Tuesday that the teen's girlfriend was talking to him on his cell phone, when Mr. Martin said someone was following him. She said she heard an exchange of words and scuffling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has put a spotlight on Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which does not require a person to retreat to claim self-defense. Police did not arrest Mr. Zimmerman, nor was he tested for drug or alcohol use or questioned at length. Although he was arrested once for assaulting an officer, police described him as &quot;squeaky clean.&quot; Mr. Martin had no arrest record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who kills an unarmed person should have to prove there was a lethal threat. Merely the shooter's word is not sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Justice Department and a grand jury using fresh eyes and critical expertise to examine the facts, the botched investigation by Sanford police of Mr. Martin's shooting won't be the last word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a tragic case where too many questions are begging for answers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grand jury will look into the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Seminole County State Attorney Norm Wolfinger said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I share in the desire of the family and the community to accurately collect and evaluate all the facts surrounding the tragic death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; said Wolfinger in a statement released Tuesday morning. &quot;That is why I directed the expeditious review of the investigation which was delivered by the Sanford Police Department one week ago today ... I will also be utilizing the investigative resources of the Seminole County Grand Jury which will be called to session on Tuesday, April 10, 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfinger, whose office has been reviewing the case since last week, asked for patience from the public and said his office will conduct &quot;a thorough, deliberate, and just review of the facts.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfinger's statement followed a decision late Monday by the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and the FBI to investigate the killing of the Miami Gardens teenager by a neighbourhood watch volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That announcement coincided with a statement from Florida Gov. Rick Scott asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to offer &quot;appropriate resources&quot; in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal and state agencies are intervening in what attorneys call a botched investigation into the killing of the Michael Krop Senior High School student, who was killed Feb. 26 in Sanford, a town of 55,000 just north of Orlando. Trayvon, 17, on suspension from school, was staying at his father's girlfriend's house when he walked to a nearby a 7-Eleven store to buy candy and iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 28, a neighbourhood watch volunteer with a long history of calling in everything from open garage doors to &quot;suspicious characters,&quot; called police to say he had spotted someone who looked drugged, was walking too slowly in the rain, and appeared to be looking at people's houses. Zimmerman sounded alarmed because the stranger had his hand in his waistband and held something in his other hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unarmed teen was carrying Skittles and a can of Arizona iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman said he had stepped out of his truck to check the name of the street he was on when Trayvon attacked him from behind as he walked back to his truck, police said. He said he feared for his life and fired the semi-automatic handgun he was licensed to carry because he feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The department will conduct a thorough and independent review of all of the evidence and take appropriate action at the conclusion of the investigation,&quot; the Justice Department said in a statement. &quot;The department also is providing assistance to and co-operating with the state officials in their investigation into the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all federal civil rights crimes, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person acted intentionally and with the specific intent to do something which the law forbids - the highest level of intent in criminal law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Negligence, recklessness, mistakes and accidents are not prosecutable under the federal criminal civil rights laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the start, Trayvon's family accused Sanford police of moulding the investigation to fit Zimmerman's account. Several witnesses said they heard cries that sounded like a boy wailing - howling silenced by the crack of gunfire - and were shocked to hear police later portray the cries as Zimmerman's. One witness said police ignored her repeated phone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief was accused of telling lies big and small in ways that shielded Zimmerman. The family hired attorneys who helped devise a national campaign to demand a federal investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of Congress and prominent black clergy members joined the chorus for a federal probe. At a rally outside the Sanford courthouse Monday, students called for Zimmerman's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Chief Bill Lee told The Miami Herald that he was comfortable that his investigators were fair and thorough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can say very confidently we would welcome any outside entity that wants to come look at what we did,&quot; Lee said last week. &quot;They are welcome to come here and look at it. We have not done anything but conduct a fair and complete investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dismissed accusations of irregularities and insisted that investigators found no probable cause to arrest Zimmerman because there was no evidence to disprove his version of events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Community Relations Service will be in Sanford this week to meet with civil rights leaders, community leaders and local law enforcement officials to address tension in the community, the Justice Department announcement said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, a personal dispute is settled with gunfire. Once again, an unarmed victim is eulogized and buried. And once again, Florida's 7-year-old &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot;law is going on trial. Only this time, the test will come in the national court of public opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This unlikely turn of events leaves a bewildered Arthur Hayhoe -- you remember him -- scratching his smooth scalp. Why this particular episode? &quot;I've got eight others in my files just like it,&quot; Hayhoe says. &quot;Each of them stayed local. They were reported in the local papers, but ... they never went any further. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What happened that made this one catch fire and go national, I can't say. But it sure took off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that Hayhoe is complaining. While others manage their fresh sorrow and outrage, Hayhoe glimpses, finally, a competitive advantage. The longtime gun-control activist from Wesley Chapel was laboring in the Second Amendment wilderness well before the Legislature passed, in 2005, the landmark statute eliminating the obligation to retreat in the face of a threat, and there were long stretches when his work seemed hopeless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stand Your Groundextends provisions of the castle doctrine -- the principle that provides for the use of deadly force at home or in your place of business -- to public places. People who are where they have a legal right to be may respond to perceived physical harm with extreme violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early on, Hayhoe and others in the gun-control community had counted on a series of unforeseen circumstances and sympathetic victims to trigger a wave of public disgust sufficient to swamp the objections of the National Rifle Association and its Florida chief, Marion Hammer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dismayed, Hayhoe stopped cataloging news clips when the number of Stand Your Ground cases acrossthe state reached 100 -- Pasco contributed a half-dozen -- without the slightest shift in the law's enormous favorability ratings and, consequently, no repeal in sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, on Feb. 26, George Zimmerman, the 28-year-old captain of a neighborhood watch program in a gated community in Sanford, shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Predictably -- &quot;They must teach this in concealed weapons permit classes,&quot; Hayhoe says -- Zimmerman told authorities he had struggled with Martin, and he felt threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt threatened -- those are the NRA's magic words,&quot; Hayhoe says. In the absence of witnesses to dispute Zimmerman's account, he says, the plain language of the statute presents an impossible lift for prosecutors. &quot;It can't be challenged in any court in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he'd been predicting, Hayhoe would have said that was that. Wait. White shooter, black victim? Like the man says, he has eight others in his files. Besides, as much as he detests the law, even Hayhoe admits it was race-neutral in its writing, and has proved race-neutral in its application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the thing: Tracey Martin and Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon's parents, weren't having it. The shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin flamed into a social media conflagration and snared the attention of traditional media. Now the feds are investigating, and a Seminole County grand jury will have a look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What this means for the Legislature's 2013 docket remains anybody's guess. Speaker-designate Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, scheduled to set the agenda, says it's early. &quot;Let's recognize that the family is grieving the loss of their young man,&quot; Weatherford says. &quot;Let's wait to see the facts of the case, to see if there's a policy issue here. We just don't know yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Legg, the Republican Port Richey representative and state senate candidate, is similarly wary. &quot;Let the facts play themselves out,&quot; he says. &quot;Let's not write law based solely on what CNN and ABC report.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That suits Hayhoe, who is renewed and eager to be entertaining in the campaign season ahead. Hear him sharpening his argument on the strop of this cause celebre. The Legislature &quot;wanted a shoot-first society,&quot; he says, &quot;and now they've got one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
