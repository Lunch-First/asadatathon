<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time.  As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as needed.  I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.  We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.  Along with our prayers, that's what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office of the House of Representative WM Lacy Clay, U.S Government has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of last Saturday's tragic police shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year old unarmed African American teen in Ferguson, Missouri, who was shot multiple times and killed by a Ferguson police officer, Congressman Wm. Lacy Clay (D) Missouri, joined by House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Congressman John Conyers (D) Michigan, and Congresswoman Marsha Fudge (D) Ohio have asked U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to expand the scope of the FBI investigation into the shooting, including a rigorous review of patterns of alleged police misconduct. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their letter to Attorney General Holder. Mr. Clay and his colleagues wrote:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In light of the foregoing developments, we ask the Department of Justice to investigate the shooting of Michael Brown, looking at both the facts of the specific incident as well as the potential for any pattern or practice of police misconduct by the Ferguson Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We understand that the St. Louis County Police Department is investigating the matter in order to have some level of independent investigation take place, but this arrangement is insufficient for at least two reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the St. Louis County Police Department may not be the most objective or credible body to investigate civil rights matters involving law enforcement given evidence of racial profiling by that department in the recent past, which Congressman Clay had asked the Department of Justice to investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, only the federal government has the resources, the experience, and the full independence to give this case the close scrutiny that the citizens of Ferguson and the greater St. Louis area deserve. Moreover, to the extent that a pattern or practice of police misconduct may exist, such misconduct would be a clear violation of federal law, including 42 U.S.C. &sect; 14141, which makes it unlawful for State or local law enforcementofficers to engage in a pattern or practice of conduct that deprives persons of rights protected bythe Constitution or laws of the United States. Such conduct would include the use of excessive force by police.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">What happened in Missouri?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basics: An unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown was fatally shot Saturday by a police officer in suburban St. Louis. People protested Saturday, Sunday and Monday, with large crowds of protesters and police facing off multiple times. Some rioting and looting also broke out late Sunday night. The FBI has launched an investigation, but federal authorities will also monitor a separate investigation being carried out by local police.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Why and how was Michael Brown shot?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances surrounding the shooting are unclear. Police said Saturday that the shooting followed an encounter Saturday afternoon involving a police officer, Brown and another person, but additional confirmed details are scarce. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County police, said the episode began with &quot;a physical confrontation.&quot; Belmar did not explain what prompted the confrontation, but he said the officer was pushed back into his squad car during the episode and one shot was fired from the officer's weapon inside the car. Brown was shot multiple times, Belmar said, and all shell casings matched the officer's gun. It's not known yet why the officer shot him or why lethal force was used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, an attorney hired by Brown's family, said Monday evening that witnesses disputed the police account, but he did not elaborate on what those witnesses said occurred. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">What do we know about Michael Brown?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was an 18-year-old who recently graduated from high school and had been set to start studies at Vatterott College, a trade school, on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a good boy,&quot; his father, Michael Brown Sr., said Monday. He described his son as fun, silly and always ready to make people laugh.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">What do we know about the person who shot him?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities have said the shooter was an officer with the Ferguson Police Department. The officer, who has not been identified, has been placed on paid administrative leave.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Who is investigating the shooting?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI is conducting a civil rights investigation, and St. Louis County police are investigating the shooting at the request of the Ferguson Police Department. (Ferguson is part of St. Louis County.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police willsend the results of the investigation to the St. Louis County Attorney's Office for a decision regarding any criminal charges.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Can you tell me anything about Ferguson? </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson is a small, predominantly African American city just outside St. Louis. It has about 21,000 residents, and a little more than two-thirds of them are black, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">What has the response been from people in Ferguson?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vigils and protests followed Brown's death. There was an immediate outcry from the community on Saturday after Brown was killed. Some people chanted, &quot;Kill the police,&quot; according to witnesses. There were reports of additional shots being fired as dozens of police officers arrived at the scene, but no other injuries were reported. There were additional protests Sunday and Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, many people used the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown to show how people in communities far from Ferguson were reacting to the shooting.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Has there been any violence in the wake of Brown's death?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday night, following a candlelight vigil for Brown, some people took to Ferguson's streets, smashing windows and looting stores. A convenience store was set on fire, and a group of men reportedly tried to load an ATM onto a truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 300 officers responded, and 32 people were arrested.Two officers sustained minor injuries.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">How have elected officials in the area responded? </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D), Sens. Claire McCaskill (D) and Roy Blunt (R), St. Louis Mayor Francis G. Slay and County Executive Charlie A. Dooley have all called for a full investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said the local authorities should &quot;complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right&quot; even as the FBI carries out an investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamilah Nasheed, a Missouri state senator, called for the officer who killed Brown to be fired and indicted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. - The FBI on Monday launched a civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer, an incident that has set off days of unrest in this St. Louis suburb and pushed the question of racial fairness again to the forefront of national discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, a college-bound 18-year-old, was shot and killed Saturday in this small, predominantly African American city after an apparent confrontation with police. His death immediately inspired both solemn vigils and angry protests, which in recent days have left some stores looted, buildings burned and shattered glass in the streets. At least 32 people have been arrested on suspicion of looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrations showed no sign of abating Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a good boy. He didn't deserve none of this. None of it,&quot; said Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., who was one of more than two dozen relatives and friends at an afternoon news conference at the Jennings Mason Temple church near St. Louis. &quot;We need justice for our son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details surrounding Brown's death remain unclear. But the case is recalling the racial animosity surrounding the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012 and other recent altercations between African Americans and police. The Martin case drew in President Obama, who called for calm amid similar anger and noted that, if he had a son, he would &quot;have looked like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama did not comment on the case Monday during a public appearance in Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where he is on vacation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's family moved to hire lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represented Martin's family after the teenager, also unarmed at the time of his death, was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer. Appearing here, Crump called Brown's shooting &quot;another senseless death of another person of color.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Bar Association, which represents African American lawyers and judges, has called for an investigation into the deaths of both Brown and Eric Garner, a 43-year-old Staten Island man who died in mid-July after being placed in a chokehold by a New York police officer. A thorough civil rights investigation is the only way that &quot;the African American community's faith in law enforcement can be strengthened,&quot; Pamela Meanes, president of the association, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The death of yet another African American at the hands of those sworn to protect and serve the community where he lived is heartbreaking,&quot; Cornell William Brooks, president and chief executive of the NAACP, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Brown case, police say it appears that the teen was shot following a physical altercation with a police officer at his cruiser and a struggle involving the officer's gun. But authorities have not said what resulted in Brown being shot multiple times nearly three dozen feet from the officer's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump said witnesses have disputed the account offered by police, but he did not elaborate on what these witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on anyone with a video of Brown's death to come forward to show &quot;exactly what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their baby was executed in broad daylight,&quot; Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheryl Mimura, an FBI special agent in St. Louis, said that the bureau was opening an investigation into any potential civil rights violations that may have occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shooting incident in Ferguson, Missouri this weekend deserves a fulsome review,&quot; Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the FBI's investigation &quot;will supplement, rather than supplant,&quot; the local inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At every step, we will work with the local investigators, who should be prepared to complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right,&quot; he said. &quot;Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder had already instructed attorneys in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division &quot;to monitor developments relating to the shooting incident,&quot; department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said in an e-mail to The Washington Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local investigation will be conducted by the St. Louis County Police Department at the request of the Ferguson police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Belmar, chief of the county police, promised an impartial investigation, pointing out that none of his department's officers was involved in the shooting. &quot;I want to assure you that this is a very complicated investigation, as it should be,&quot; he said Monday during a news conference. &quot;A man lost his life. There's a police officer involved in this. We need to make sure this investigation is done right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An autopsy of Brown showed that he was &quot;struck several times by gunfire,&quot; Belmar said. The autopsy was carried out on Sunday, the day after Brown was killed, and his body was returned to his family for burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the news conference at the church, Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said that she had been overjoyed at the prospect of dropping her son off at college on Monday. Instead, she is planning his burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was my firstborn son. . . .Ask anyone and they'd tell you how much I loved my son.. . . I just wish I could have been there to help him, my son,&quot; she muttered before breaking down in tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's grandmother, with whom he occasionally lived, could barely make it to the car afterward. She had to be carried by other family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, God, they took my baby,&quot; she wailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting and ensuing violence have drawn national attention, with every twist and turn explored on social media. There have been multiple public gatherings since Brown was killed, with protesters marching and chanting near the Ferguson police headquarters again Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The looting on Sunday night was the work of only part of the crowd that had gathered to protest, Belmar said. He said the police got thousands of calls reporting shots fired, burglaries and assaults, among other things. A Wal-Mart was among the businesses looted, and a photographer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch documented a burning convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of police officers responded to the looting, according to the St. Louis County police. Two officers suffered relatively minor injuries. The people who were arrested could face charges of assault, burglary and larceny, a spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday morning, the sites where rioting occurred were covered with graffiti, broken glass and debris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar said Sunday that a Ferguson police officer &quot;had an encounter&quot; with Brown and another person Saturday. At some point, the officer reportedly was pushed back into his car and &quot;physically assaulted,&quot; the chief said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a struggle over the officer's weapon, which was fired once in the car, Belmar said. Following that, the officer got out of the car and fired at the teenager multiple times. Brown was killed about 35 feet from the officer's car, Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer involved has been placed on paid administrative leave. His name has not been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are still very few publicly released details of the shooting, but many civil rights leaders and family members have focused on how Brown was dressed at the time of the incident. According to reports, he was wearing cargo shorts, flip-flops and a T-shirt. He was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From what I'm told he had on, how would a trained policeman even feel that he could have been bearing arms?&quot; said the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader. Sharpton plans to visit St. Louis on Tuesday to meet with the Brown family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Policemen are to use deadly force to protect their lives,&quot; he said. &quot;If you're looking at a kid18 years old and you know he does not appear to be able to be concealing a weapon, then what is the life-threatening circumstances that would justify firing your weapon?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack on a Haitian prison on the capital's outskirts to free the son of a prominent businessman being held on kidnapping charges led to the escape of 329 inmates, officials said Monday. So far, authorities have only managed to capture 10 of the prisoners who escaped Sunday when armed men attacked the prison in Croix-des-Bouquets to free Clifford Brandt, a member of a wealthy family, who has been held since 2012 for allegedly running a kidnapping ring in the capital. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unarmed black teenager fatally shot Saturday by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., had been struggling for the officer's gun, law enforcement officials said Sunday as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said Michael Brown, 18, struggled for a Ferguson police officer's weapon in a patrol car before the officer fired several shots about noon Saturday. Witnesses have said Brown had his hands in the air as he fled the patrol car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County police, separate from the Ferguson police, are handling the investigation, which Belmar said would be thorough. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are investigating this incident as we would any other shooting,&quot; said a statement on the St. Louis County agency's Facebook page. &quot;There is no bias or favoritism applied as we are an outside agency and were not involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson described the incident as &quot;tragic&quot; in an interview with Fox 2, the local Fox television affiliate. &quot;It's tragic for the community. It's tragic for our police family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unnamed officer who fired the shots, who has been on the force for six years, has been placed on paid administrative leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of shots fired is unknown, though Belmar said Brown was shot &quot;more than just a couple of times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Belmar, Brown was walking with a friend in the middle of a street when an officer tried to exit his vehicle. Police said Brown pushed the officer back into the police car. Brown then entered the officer's vehicle and a struggle ensued over the officer's weapon, according to police. During the physical altercation, a shot was fired inside the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer and Brown then exited the vehicle and, at that point, the shooting occurred, Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses have had different accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorin Johnson, a friend of the victim, told Fox 2 that he was walking in the street with Brown when the police squad car pulled up. The officer said to &quot;Get the eff onto the sidewalk,&quot; he recounted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was not but a minute from our destination and we would be off the street,&quot; Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said the officer didn't get out of his police car but &quot;reached his arm out the window and grabbed my friend around the neck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I witnessed the police chase after the guy, full force,&quot; said witness Piaget Crenshaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He ran for his life. They shot him, and he fell. He put his arms up to let them know that he was compliant, and he was unarmed and they shot him twice more and he fell to the ground and died.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar said the crime scene extends about 35 feet from where the police car was parked to where the fatal shooting took place, and where shell casings matching the officer's weapon have been found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the police held the news conference Sunday, hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Ferguson police station, saying, &quot;Don't shoot me!&quot; as they held up their hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of residents from the neighborhood gathered Saturday night at the crime scene in protest. The crowd grew to 1,000 people, according to local media reports.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) - A few thousand people have crammed the street where a black man was shot multiple times by a suburban St. Louis police officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candlelight vigil Sunday night was for 18-year-old Michael Brown, who died a day earlier. Police say he was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One group of young men broke off to spray paint &quot;R.I.P. Michael&quot; on the street, and others placed candles, flowers and a teddy bear at the exact location where Brown was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., said he appreciated the outpouring of support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say the younger Brown was shot multiple times after a scuffle involving the officer and two people. The officer has been put on leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of local residents protested earlier, and a civil rights leader expressed outrage at the killing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal shooting of a black teenager sent hundreds of angry residents out of their apartments in a predominantly black Missouri city in a confrontation with police that lasted several hours. They shouted obscenities and some threats, such as &quot;kill the police&quot;, but there were no reports of additional injuries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black teen was identified as Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager's grandmother, Desiree Harris, saw the 18-year-old recent high school graduate running near her home on Tuesday afternoon when she passed him in her car. Minutes later, she found his body on the street - fatally shot by a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris said she was expecting her grandson to visit her that afternoon but discovered him dead after she heard the commotion outside the apartment complex in Ferguson, a northern suburb of St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was running this way,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My grandson never even got into a fight,&quot; she said. &quot;He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told an acquaintance the shooting was &quot;wrong and it was coldhearted&quot;, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. According to the newspaper, Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, held a sign that read: &quot;Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman with the St. Louis County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting at the request of the local department, confirmed that a Ferguson police officer shot the man. The spokesman didn't give the reason for the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP, the local chapter of the civil rights group, said the FBI should get involved &quot;to protect the integrity of the investigation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He alluded to the 2012 racially charged shooting of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old high school student, by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was subsequently acquitted of murder charges, and to the death of a New York man from a police chokehold after he was confronted for selling individual cigarettes on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaskin said officials in the organization spoke with St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, who told them the teenager had been shot twice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rioting and looting erupted in Ferguson, Missouri, late on Sunday and spread to neighboring towns as protests over the killing of a black teenager by a police officer turned violent, police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds broke the windows of cars and stores, set a building alight and looted shops following a day of demonstrations over the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old shot on Saturday by a Ferguson police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is &quot;a lot of unrest up there, and a lot of rioting going on, and looting,&quot; Officer Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department, said early on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the unrest had spread from Ferguson, a largely black St. Louis suburb, to adjacent communities. About 150 officers in riot gear from throughout St. Louis County had been sent to the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schellman said arrests had been made but had no details. He and three hospitals had no reports of injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Brown was shot after a struggle over a gun in a police car. It was not immediately clear why Brown was in the car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the office fired more shots before leaving the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and has been put on administrative leave, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told a news conference. The officer's race has not been disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's protests turned violent after dark, according to news station KMOV-TV, with rioters smashing windows of stores and restaurants and damaging cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KMOV TV footage showed a QuikTrip convenience store set on fire after it was looted. A teenage witness told KMOV, &quot;They destroyed everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobs rushed out of other stores, including an AutoZone and a Ross Dress for Less, with armfuls of stolen goods, KMOV and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's mother told TV station KSDK that her son was a &quot;good child getting ready to go to college&quot; and that he was visiting his grandmother when the shooting took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis County branch of the civil rights group NAACP has said it wants the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton said in a statement Sunday that he had spoken with Brown's grandfather and had agreed to visit St. Louis to help the family.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLICE in St Louis, Missouri, faced protests yesterday after an officer shot dead an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Michael Brown, 18, was shot at least twice after a confrontation with the policeman in the mainly black suburb of Ferguson on Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jon Belmar, the chief of St Louis County Police, said that the incident began with a fight in a patrol car that quickly escalated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the teenager assaulted the policeman and &quot;it is our understanding... that within the police car, there was a struggle over the officer's weapon&quot;. It appeared that one shot was fired inside the vehicle. The officer, who has not been named, then fired &quot;multiple shots&quot; at Michael Brown after he left the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shooting happened close to the home of the teenager's grandmother, Desiree Harris. She said she saw her grandson running when she passed him in her car. Minutes later, she found his body on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He was running this way,&quot; she said. &quot;When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Gaskin, a member of the St Louis County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, called for a federal investigation into the shooting. He said the FBI should get involved &quot;to protect the integrity&quot; of the inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Gaskin said officials had spoken to Mr Belmar, who told them the teenager had been shot twice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jamilah Nasheed, a Democratic state senator, told the St Louis Post-Dispatch that she would ask the Justice Department today for a formal investigation. Ms Harris said her grandson had recently graduated from high school and was looking forward to the future. &quot;My grandson never even got into a fight,&quot; she said. &quot;He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told an acquaintance that the shooting was &quot;wrong and it was cold-hearted&quot;, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A crowd of some 200 people gathered at the site of the shooting on Saturday, some of them shouting &quot;kill the police&quot; and yelling profanities, a county police spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several distraught relations were outside talking with neighbours, including the teenager's stepfather, Louis Head, who held a sign that read: &quot;Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!&quot; Dozens of police cars remained parked near the scene as mourners left candles and flowers at a makeshift memorial in the middle of the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thomas Jackson, the chief of the Ferguson police department, said the officer involved, a six-year veteran had been placed on paid administrative leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are hoping for calm and for people to give us a chance to conduct a thorough investigation,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RIOTING has erupted after the killing of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer in St Louis, Missouri. Shops were looted, cars attacked and a building set alight as police tried to seal off areas of the city to quell the violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say Michael Brown, 18, was shot several times after a struggle in a patrol car on Saturday afternoon in Ferguson, a mainly black suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The riots started late yesterday after thousands of people attended a candlelight vigil for Brown. Some protesters surrounded the Ferguson police headquarters, some holding their hands in the air and chanting: &quot;Don't shoot me.&quot; Others stood on police cars and taunted officers in riot gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing drew criticism from civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida by a neighbourhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of racially-motivated murder charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,&quot; said community spokesman John Gaskin. A leading campaigner, the Rev Al Sharpton, called the shooting &quot;very disturbing&quot; and said he planned to go to Ferguson to meet Brown's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local police chief Jon Belmar said the shooting occurred after an officer encountered Brown and another man on the street near an apartment block.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Belmar said one man pushed the policeman back into his squad car and a struggle began. At least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the vehicle, then the fight spilled out into the street where Mr Brown was shot several times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Belmar said it was unclear if Brown, who police confirmed was unarmed was the man who fought the officer, and his department was still investigating why the officer opened fire. The FBI may also be called in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said the second man has not been arrested, and it was not known if he had a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said the officer who shot him should be fired and prosecuted, and added: &quot;I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. The FBI said Monday it has opened an inquiry into the weekend shooting death of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer that sparked a night of looting and vandalism in this suburb of St. Louis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special Agent Cheryl Mimura, of the FBI's office in St. Louis, said the agency had begun an investigation into possible civil rights violations connected to the death of Michael Brown, 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances of Brown's death remained in sharp dispute two days after he was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 northwest of St. Louis. Police have said an officer, who has not been identified, was &quot;physically assaulted&quot; before opening fire early Saturday afternoon. Authorities also said there had been a struggle &quot;over the officer's weapon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics have questioned the police's account and demanded that the officer face prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Chief Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County Police said an autopsy had shown that Brown had been &quot;struck several times by gunfire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar's agency has been leading the investigation, and Mimura said the county police would continue their work as the FBI conducted its review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference Monday, Belmar pleaded for the public's patience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand that the public has a right to be skeptical, and I appreciate that and I would expect that the public be skeptical oftentimes of government or some forms of it,&quot; he said. &quot;But I would also ask the public to be reasonable because it takes a long time to make sure we do this investigation the right way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, a Justice Department spokeswoman, Dena Iverson, said Monday that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had instructed lawyers in the Civil Rights Division to monitor developments in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials on Monday were also absorbing the consequences of what they said was an unprecedented night of chaos for Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been doing this 28 years,&quot; the chief said. &quot;Not only have I never seen anything like this, I've never even heard about it in the history of St. Louis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A vigil Sunday for Brown was followed by angry demonstrations overnight after protesters took to the streets, looting stores, vandalizing cars and confronting police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the county police, said 32 people were arrested. He also said two police officers were injured, including one who was struck by a brick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People smashed car windows and carried away armloads of looted goods from stores Sunday night after thousands of people packed a suburban St. Louis area at a vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people looted a convenience store. Several other stores along a main road near the shooting scene were broken into and looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People were seen carrying bags of food and toilet paper. TV footage showed streams of people walking out of a liquor store carrying bottles of alcohol, and in some cases protesters were standing atop police cars or taunting officers who stood stoic, often in riot gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other witnesses reported seeing people vandalize police cars and kick in windows. Television footage showed windows busted out of a TV station van.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris said she was expecting her grandson, to visit her that afternoon &quot;He was running this way,&quot; she said. &quot;When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting was sparked by a fight between the victim and an officer in a squad car that quickly escalated, police said. The officer has been put on administrative leave. AP</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(portfolio_slideshow id=290960] Updated 7 p.m. Monday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida attorney Benjamin Crump started his public representation of the parents of an unarmed black teenager shot by a Ferguson police officer with a news conference in a church packed with reporters and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a late afternoon event marked by applause and occasional sobbing from the audience, Crump stood with Michael Brown Sr. and Lesley McSpadden, the parents of shooting victim Michael Brown, and asked witnesses to Saturday's shooting to come forward and give statements to U.S. Department of Justice investigators. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This family rejects what the police authorities said at the press conference about how this played out,&quot; said Crump, who is best known for representing the family of Trayvon Martin, a black teen shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at a news conference Sunday that the shooting followed an assault on a police officer, according to news reports. The shooting in the suburb of Ferguson ignited protests that were followed by looting Sunday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details of what led to the fatal incident were unclear, including exactly what led the officer to open fire. Attorney General Eric Holder announced Monday that FBI agents from the St. Louis field office would work with attorneys from the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney's Office to investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump also asked for anyone with video of the incident who had feared turning it over to local law enforcement to bring it to the National Bar Association, a network of predominantly African-American lawyers and judges; the NAACP; or a family member of Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Gray, of St. Louis firm Johnson Gray, was introduced as local counsel for the family, and NAACP President and Chief Executive Cornell William Brooks spoke briefly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown Sr. described his son as fun and silly, an 18-year-old who would &quot;make you laugh&quot; and deserved justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McSpadden, who kept dabbing her eyes, had difficulty speaking, but added, &quot;No violence, just justice, y'all. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The younger Brown, who had planned to go to technical school to learn to work on heaters and air conditioners, would have been dropped off at school by his parents Monday, Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Instead of celebrating his future, they are having to plan his funeral and talk to attorney Gray and I about second autopsies,&quot; Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump gained notoriety for representing the family of Trayvon Martin, shot by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida, as he walked home with a bag of Skittles and an Arizona-brand drink. Crump said Martin's father had reached out to Brown Sr. and McSpadden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump had pushed for criminal prosecution of Zimmerman, which ended with an acquittal last summer. Crump won the late teen's family more than $1 million in a settlement with Zimmerman's homeowners association, according to an October 2013 USA Today report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to civil rights, Crump focuses on personal injury and wrongful death cases, according to his firm's website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump's firm website bears the motto, &quot;We help David fight Goliath&quot; and lists prominent cases Crump has brought, mostly in Florida. But Crump has been involved in other out-of-state cases as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, he helped focus national attention on Kendrick Johnson, a 17-year-old found dead in a rolled-up wrestling mat in a Valdosta, Georgia, high school gym. He helped get the U.S. Attorney's office to launch a federal investigation after the local sheriff had closed the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump also was involved for a while in the case of a teen who was paralyzed in a police shooting in Pittsburgh in October, but his name is not on the online court documents for a federal lawsuit brought over the shooting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager Saturday by a police officer in a St. Louis suburb came after a struggle for the officer's gun, police officials said Sunday, in an explanation that met with outrage and skepticism in the largely African-American community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of the youth, Michael Brown, 18, ignited protests on Saturday and Sunday in Ferguson, Mo., a working-class suburb of about 20,000 residents. Hundreds of people gathered at the scene of the shooting to question the police and to light candles for Mr. Brown, who was planning to begin college classes on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, held a cardboard sign that said, ''Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference on Sunday morning, the St. Louis County police chief, Jon Belmar, said that a man had been shot and killed after he had assaulted a police officer and the two had struggled over the officer's gun inside his patrol car. At least one shot was fired from inside the car, Chief Belmar said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,'' Chief Belmar told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But elected officials and advocacy groups called for a full investigation and questioned the tactics of the police, who acknowledged that Mr. Brown had been unarmed. Antonio French, a city councilman in St. Louis, was at the scene of the protests on Sunday and said in an interview that more than 100 people had gathered, most of them silently standing in groups, some leaving behind teddy bears and balloons to memorialize Mr. Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. French said he was unsatisfied with the police department's explanation of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I find it hard to believe,'' he said, adding that he was disappointed with the police response in the aftermath of the shooting, which further distressed Ferguson residents and members of Mr. Brown's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's a textbook example of how not to handle the situation,'' Mr. French said. ''Ferguson has a white government and a white mayor, but a large black population. This situation has brought out whatever rifts were between that minority community and the Ferguson government.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esther Haywood, the president of the N.A.A.C.P. in St. Louis County, said in a statement: ''We are hurt to hear that yet another teenaged boy has been slaughtered by law enforcement, especially in light of the recent death of Eric Garner in New York, who was killed for selling cigarettes. We plan to do everything within our power to ensure that the Ferguson Police Department as well as the St. Louis County Police Department releases all details pertinent to the shooting. We strongly encourage residents to stay away from the crime scene so that no additional citizens are injured.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police on Sunday said they were still trying to sort out the exact details, but they released what they said was the fullest account of the shooting that they could provide. Just after noon on Saturday, the police said, an officer in a patrol car approached Mr. Brown and another man. As the officer began to leave his vehicle, one of the men pushed the officer back into the car and ''physically assaulted'' him, according to the police department's account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A struggle occurred ''over the officer's weapon,'' and at least one shot was fired inside the car, Chief Belmar said. The two left the car, and the officer shot Mr. Brown about 35 feet away from the vehicle, the police reported. Several shots were fired from the officer's weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical examiner for St. Louis County is investigating to determine how many times Mr. Brown was shot, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Belmar said that the Ferguson police chief, Thomas Jackson, had called him personally and asked that his department to look into the shooting because Chief Jackson wanted an independent investigation. Chief Belmar said that the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney would determine whether the shooting was justified or charges should be filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Chief Belmar spoke at a televised news conference, chants of ''Don't shoot!'' and ''We want answers!'' could be heard from the protesters who had gathered outside the Ferguson police headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a candlelight vigil on Sunday evening, the heightened tensions between the police and the African-American community were on display. A crowd estimated in the thousands flooded the streets near the scene of the shooting, some of them chanting ''No justice, no peace.'' They were met by hundreds of police officers in riot gear, carrying rifles and shields, as well as K-9 units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses described a peaceful protest that later turned volatile, and there were scattered reports of violence. Images and videos captured on cellphones and posted on social media sites appeared to show people spray-painting and looting a QuikTrip gas station and other stores. Rioters shattered the windows of the gas station and damaged several police cars, said Brian Lewis, a spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not immediately clear if anyone was injured or arrested during the protests. County officials did not return calls and messages seeking comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community and civic leaders pleaded for calm and to allow the investigation to run its course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have to do this in a constructive manner,'' Mayor James Knowles III of Ferguson said in an interview with a local Fox television station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer who shot Mr. Brown has been on the force about six years and will be interviewed extensively by detectives on Sunday, the police said. They did not identify the officer involved by either name or rank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Any other details, including the reason as to why the encounter occurred and the initial struggle ensued, are still a part of the continuing investigation,'' the police said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members of Mr. Brown said that he had been walking to his grandmother's house when the shooting occurred. His body remained in the street for some time, guarded by the police, while neighbors gathered in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials, fearing civil disorder, dispatched officers with police dogs to control the crowds. In response, some Twitter users posted pictures of the dogs at the Ferguson gathering on Saturday next to photos of police dogs used to control African-American crowds during the Jim Crow era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown had just graduated from high school and was planning to attend Vatterott College, his mother, Lesley McSpadden, told reporters. His family has retained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer who represented Trayvon Martin's relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You took my son away from me,'' she told the television news station KMOV. ''Do you know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Not many. Because you bring them down to this type of level, where they feel like they don't got nothing to live for anyway. 'They're going to try to take me out anyway.' ''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Rev. Al Sharpton is heading to the scene of another controversial death involving cops - this time in Missouri, where an unarmed teen was shot to death by a police officer.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sharpton, who is set to lead a march in Staten Island later this month to protest the police chokehold death of Eric Garner, said he will travel to St. Louis, where Michael Brown, 18, was killed. Police on Sunday said he was unarmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sharpton said Brown's grandfather asked him to make sure there was a fair investigation and justice for the teen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I assured him the National Action Network will stand with the family,&quot; the civil-rights activist and talk-show host said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shooting occurred Saturday afternoon when an officer encountered two people on the street near an apartment complex in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said. One man pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began, he added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was not clear if Brown was the man who struggled with the officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the car. The clash spilled out onto the street, and Brown was then shot multiple times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Ferguson police headquarters on Sunday, some chanting, &quot;Don't shoot me!&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown didn't get due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The still unnamed police officer who shot the 18-year-old black teenager dead in Ferguson will get plenty of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the root of the frustration that is driving the African-American community to the streets in north St. Louis County over yet another senseless killing of a young black man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do we want? Justice!&quot; chanted a crowd of family, friends and community members who gathered after the Saturday shooting. &quot;When do we want it? Now!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They may get justice - in the form of a prosecution of the police officer who shot and killed the recent Normandy High School graduate - but the odds aren't stacked in their favor, and even if it happens, it won't happen anytime soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's history is riddled with officer-involved-shootings in which juries give police who perform a dangerous job the benefit of the doubt. Trying to learn from those shootings to prevent further ones is difficult, says criminologist David Klinger, one of the nation's foremost experts on police shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Klinger, a former police officer, practices his craft just down the street from Ferguson, at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, where he is an associate professor in the criminal justice department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the findings in a 2012 study he did of shootings by police in the city of St. Louis could offer some interesting guidance to whomever ultimately investigates the shooting of Michael Brown. Mr. Klinger recommended that the shooting investigations be handled with more transparency, and that ultimately, findings be posted on the department's website, with the names of officers clearly identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few police departments nationwide operate with such transparency, Mr. Klinger's research has found, and that means little public accountability when a police officer shoots an unarmed civilian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's no wonder, then, that leaders in Ferguson, including members of the NAACP, have called for the FBI to take over the lead in the investigation into how an unarmed 18-year-old was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a good suggestion, especially considering that the NAACP already has an ongoing federal complaint against the county police department over alleged racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While answers are likely not to come in this case as quickly as some would like, appointing a federal agency to oversee the investigation will instill the sort of trust that might calm some of the justified anger over the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a good first step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a second one: Efforts to elevate the importance of annual studies of racial profiling by police in the region and the state should be intensified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, for the 11th time in the 14 years that data has been collected, the disparity index that measures potential racial profiling by law enforcement in the state got worse. Black Missourians were 66 percent more likely in 2013 to be stopped by police, and blacks and Hispanics were both more likely to be searched, even though the likelihood of finding contraband was higher among whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every year these numbers come out to little fanfare, in part because there isn't enough political will to do the further study to break them down by precincts and individual officers to determine whether there is a cultural or training problem in entire departments or just a few rogue, racist cops who need to find another line of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the tragic death of Michael Brown will spur a little political will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he wasn't driving a car when he was pulled over and shot, the concept is the same: Nearly every black man in America has a story of being pulled over, stopped or harassed as a young person for doing something that a white teenager would never imagine might end in being on the wrong end of a police officer's gun. Driving While Black. Walking While Black. Wearing a Hoodie While Black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ferguson, the city where Michael died, the police in 2013 pulled over blacks at a 37 percent higher rate than whites compared to their relative populations. Black drivers were twice as likely to be searched and twice as likely to be arrested compared to white drivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those statistics don't prove racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those numbers plus a dead young man in the street make a strong case for deserving a closer look.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Mon Aug 11, 2014(Reuters) - Rioting and looting erupted in Ferguson, Missouri, late on Sunday as protests over the killing of a black teenager by a police officer turned violent, law enforcement officials and media reports said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds broke the windows of cars and stores following a day of demonstrations over the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old shot dead on Saturday by a Ferguson police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are currently experiencing a riot,&quot; a Ferguson police dispatcher said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 150 officers in riot gear from throughout St. Louis County, along with canine units, were sent to the area, a dispatcher for the St. Louis County Police Department said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no immediate word on injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Brown was shot after a struggle over a gun in a police car. It was not immediately clear why Brown as in the car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the office fired more shots before leaving the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and has been put on administrative leave, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told a news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our understanding at this point in the investigation, that within the police car, there was a struggle over the officer's weapon,&quot; Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests erupted soon after the shooting in Ferguson, a town of about 23,000 people some 20 miles (32 km) north of St. Louis. Some demonstrators shouted &quot;kill the police&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's protests turned violent after dark, according to news station KMOV-TV, with rioters smashing the window of a store and damaging cars. The crowd broke the windows of a news truck, the station said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A teenage girl told KMOV that a QuikTrip convenience store was being looted. Asked what looters were taking, she said, &quot;Everything. They destroyed everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's mother told local TV broadcaster KSDK that her son was a &quot;good child getting ready to go to college&quot; and that he was visiting his grandmother when the incident took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He didn't bother nobody,&quot; she said. &quot;They told me how many times my son was shot - eight,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis County branch of the civil rights group NAACP has said it wants the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into the case, with many in the community telling media that race played a factor in the shooting.The police did not give any details about the officer's race.<BR>HU</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, 18, had graduated from high school and was about to enter a local college, said his mother, Lesley McSpadden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting occurred after an officer encountered two people - one of whom was Brown - on the street near an apartment complex on Saturday afternoon in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles (kilometres) north of downtown St. Louis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car, and a struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who struggled with the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn't known, but &quot;it was more than just a couple.&quot; He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer's gun. Police are still investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged and was expected to be interviewed later yesterday. Authorities aren't sure if that person was unarmed, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McSpadden said she doesn't understand why police didn't subdue her son with a club or taser instead of shooting him, and she said the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,&quot; she said yesterday at the site of the shooting, fighting back tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, and they referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighbourhood watch volunteer who was acquitted of murder charges as well as the New York City man who died from a police chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,&quot; said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP, a leading civil rights organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton called the shooting death &quot;very disturbing&quot; and the New York-based civil rights leader said he planned to go to Ferguson to meet with the family on Monday night or Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters about the time the police news conference was to begin. At one point, many of them marched into an adjacent police building, some chanting &quot;Don't shoot me&quot; while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase but didn't use force. The crowd eventually left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters outside chanted slogans - No justice, no peace and We want answers - and some carried signs that read &quot;Stop police terrorism&quot; and &quot;Disarm the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, a few thousand people crammed the street where Brown was shot for a candlelight vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics have contended that police in the St. Louis area too often target young black men. Statistics on police-involved shootings in the region were not immediately available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation. County Executive Charlie Dooley, who showed up at the protest yesterday to urge calm, said he will request an FBI investigation. U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said yesterday that Attorney General Eric Holder had instructed attorneys in the department's civil rights division to monitor developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race of the police officer involved in the shooting has not been disclosed. He has been with the Ferguson Police Department for six years, Belmar said, noting he wasn't aware of other issues involving the officer. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is a common procedure after police shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several protesters were angry that Brown's body remained on the street for hours after the killing. Belmar said that officers &quot;had to practise our due diligence, and that's why it took as long as it did.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds broke the windows of cars and stores, set a building alight and looted shops following a day of demonstrations over the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old shot on Saturday by a Ferguson police officer. <BR><BR>At least two dozen businesses were damaged, St. Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman said yesterday. More than 300 police officers, many in riot gear, tried to control the crowd, and one officer was struck by a brick while another hurt his knee while making an arrest, Schellman said. <BR><BR>Chaotic, scary <BR>&quot;The words I heard them use about the scene were 'chaotic,&quot; even 'scary,'&quot; Schellman said. <BR><BR>He said the unrest had spread from Ferguson, a largely black St. Louis suburb, to adjacent communities before ending early Monday. <BR><BR>Supporters of the teen had previously said they planned to protest again later on Monday outside the Ferguson police station, but it was unclear if that would still go on, Schellman said. <BR><BR>The 32 people arrested will face charges that could include assault, larceny and burglary, Schellman said. <BR><BR>Police said Brown was shot after a struggle over a gun in a police car. It was not immediately clear why Brown was in the car.  <BR><BR>At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the office fired more shots before leaving the car. <BR><BR>The officer, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and has been put on administrative leave, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told a news conference late Sunday. The officer's race has not been disclosed. <BR><BR>Smashing windows <BR><BR>Sunday's protests turned violent after dark, according to news station KMOV-TV, with rioters smashing windows of stores and restaurants and damaging cars. <BR><BR>KMOV-TV footage showed a QuikTrip convenience store set on fire after it was looted. A teenage witness told KMOV, &quot;They destroyed everything.&quot; <BR><BR>Mobs rushed out of other stores, including an AutoZone and a Ross Dress for Less, with armfuls of stolen goods, KMOV-TV and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper reported. <BR><BR>Brown's mother told television station KSDK that her son was a &quot;good child getting ready to go to college&quot; and that he was visiting his grandmother when the shooting took place.<BR><BR><BR> Muscat Press and Publishing House SAOC 2014  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few thousand people attended a vigil Sunday for an unarmed black man shot and killed by a suburban St. Louis police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police reportedly donned tear gas masks during the vigil for Michael Brown, 18, who died on Saturday after being shot multiple times by a Ferguson police officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One group of young men broke off to spray paint &quot;R.I.P. Michael&quot; on the street, and others placed candles, flowers and a teddy bear at the exact location where Brown was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., said he appreciated the outpouring of support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were reports of some looting and vandalism after the vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, shouts of &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; and &quot;We want answers!&quot; nearly drowned out a news conference as St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar detailed the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It began with an altercation involving two men and the officer around noon on Saturday, Belmar said. One of the men pushed the officer into his patrol car, there was a scuffle over the officer's gun, and the officer fired a shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seconds later, outside the cruiser, he fired several more shots, and 18-year-old Michael Brown lay dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was unarmed, and all the shell casings found on the ground were from the officer's gun, Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said Sunday she doesn't understand why police didn't subdue her son with a club or Taser. She said police have not explained why her son was confronted by the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to see him fired,&quot; McSpadden said. &quot;I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My son just turned 18 and graduated from high school, and he don't bother nobody,&quot; she said Saturday night. She said he was looking forward to starting at Vatterott College next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They told me how many times my son was shot. Eight,&quot; McSpadden said. She said he was visiting his grandmother, who lives in the complex, and was returning from the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis County NAACP called for an FBI investigation. Belmar has contacted the FBI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer who shot Brown has not been identified by police. He had been with the Ferguson Police Department for about six years, Belmar said. He has been put on paid administrative leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis County Police Department said Ferguson police cars do not have dash cameras and there is no surveillance video at the apartment complex where the shooting occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay tweeted Sunday saying he stands with County Executive Charlie Dooley in his call &quot;for a full and open inquiry into yesterday's shooting in Ferguson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters called for 10,000 people to join them at 10 a.m. today at the Ferguson Police Department. The crowd marched through the streets Sunday morning and afternoon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department of Commonwealth, The State of Kentucky has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Jack Conway, Gov. Steve Beshear, First Lady Jane Beshear and members of the Substance Abuse Treatment Advisory Committee today announced that 19 substance abuse treatment grant proposals from across the Commonwealth have been selected for funding through the KY Kids Recovery program.  The grants will fund comprehensive adolescent substance abuse treatment programs, both expanding treatment beds at existing facilities and creating new adolescent treatment programs with the full continuum of care, including intensive outpatient and follow-up care centers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These grants will fund public-private partnerships that will result in expanded treatment for teens in every region of Kentucky,&quot; said Attorney General Conway, who chairs the Substance Abuse Treatment Advisory Committee.  &quot;The KY Kids Recovery program is a critical investment in our ongoing effort to stop the cycle of addiction in our Commonwealth.  The recipients of these grants will utilize evidence-based substance abuse treatment services to help families riddled with addiction and save lives in Kentucky.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kentucky only has about one-tenth of the treatment beds it needs, and according to the most recent report from the Substance Abuse Health and Mental Services Administration, one in eight Kentucky high school students meet the criteria for a substance abuse disorder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Substance abuse among young people is devastating not only to the individual afflicted by the disease, but to their families, schools and communities,&quot; Mrs. Beshear said. &quot;These statewide KY Kids Recovery investments will help break young Kentuckians' cycle of substance abuse through comprehensive treatment and follow-up care, setting them on the right path toward living addiction-free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Beshear created the Substance Abuse Treatment Advisory Committee by executive order to oversee the KY Kids Recovery grant program and distribution of the settlement funds.  Existing providers, new providers, community partnerships and nonprofits were eligible to apply for the KY Kids Recovery grants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Substance Abuse Treatment Advisory Committee submitted the 19 recommended proposals to Gov. Beshear, who approved the funding for the recipients.  The programs recommended for funding are located in every region of the state and encompass all aspects of evidence-based, substance abuse services for adolescents, including prevention, outpatient counseling, intensive outpatient and residential services. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kentucky has been woefully lacking in comprehensive, statewide treatment options for youth who suffer from addiction and substance abuse disorders,&quot; Gov. Beshear said.  &quot;With these grants, families will now have places to turn to for help.  Early detection and intervention are the keys to solving the larger problem of substance use and abuse across Kentucky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">$17,976,992 has been recommended in funding from an available total of $19,200,000.  The remaining balance will be reserved for future statewide projects and administrative oversight of recipients' expenditures.  Awards will be paid through Kentucky Housing Corporation, in compliance with state accounting procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department of Commonwealth, The State of Kentucky has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Jack Conway, Gov. Steve Beshear, First Lady Jane Beshear and members of the Substance Abuse Treatment Advisory Committee today announced that 19 substance abuse treatment grant proposals from across the Commonwealth have been selected for funding through the KY Kids Recovery program.  The grants will fund comprehensive adolescent substance abuse treatment programs, both expanding treatment beds at existing facilities and creating new adolescent treatment programs with the full continuum of care, including intensive outpatient and follow-up care centers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These grants will fund public-private partnerships that will result in expanded treatment for teens in every region of Kentucky,&quot; said Attorney General Conway, who chairs the Substance Abuse Treatment Advisory Committee.  &quot;The KY Kids Recovery program is a critical investment in our ongoing effort to stop the cycle of addiction in our Commonwealth.  The recipients of these grants will utilize evidence-based substance abuse treatment services to help families riddled with addiction and save lives in Kentucky.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kentucky only has about one-tenth of the treatment beds it needs, and according to the most recent report from the Substance Abuse Health and Mental Services Administration, one in eight Kentucky high school students meet the criteria for a substance abuse disorder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Substance abuse among young people is devastating not only to the individual afflicted by the disease, but to their families, schools and communities,&quot; Mrs. Beshear said. &quot;These statewide KY Kids Recovery investments will help break young Kentuckians' cycle of substance abuse through comprehensive treatment and follow-up care, setting them on the right path toward living addiction-free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Beshear created the Substance Abuse Treatment Advisory Committee by executive order to oversee the KY Kids Recovery grant program and distribution of the settlement funds.  Existing providers, new providers, community partnerships and nonprofits were eligible to apply for the KY Kids Recovery grants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Substance Abuse Treatment Advisory Committee submitted the 19 recommended proposals to Gov. Beshear, who approved the funding for the recipients.  The programs recommended for funding are located in every region of the state and encompass all aspects of evidence-based, substance abuse services for adolescents, including prevention, outpatient counseling, intensive outpatient and residential services. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kentucky has been woefully lacking in comprehensive, statewide treatment options for youth who suffer from addiction and substance abuse disorders,&quot; Gov. Beshear said.  &quot;With these grants, families will now have places to turn to for help.  Early detection and intervention are the keys to solving the larger problem of substance use and abuse across Kentucky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">$17,976,992 has been recommended in funding from an available total of $19,200,000.  The remaining balance will be reserved for future statewide projects and administrative oversight of recipients' expenditures.  Awards will be paid through Kentucky Housing Corporation, in compliance with state accounting procedures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, MO.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. - The mother of an 18-year-old black man shot and killed in a St. Louis suburb says she doesn't understand why police didn't subdue her son with a club or Taser, and she says the policeman who shot him should be jailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesley McSpadden says her son, Michael Brown, had graduated from high school and was headed to college. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McSpadden was speaking at the site of the Saturday killing. She says police have not explained why her son was confronted by the officer. &quot;I would like to see him fired,&quot; McSpadden said Sunday. &quot;I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say the unarmed man was shot multiple times after a scuffle involving the officer and two people. The officer has been put on leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation. County Executive Charlie Dooley, who showed up at a protest Sunday during a police news conference, urged calm and said he will request an FBI investigation. U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said Sunday that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had instructed attorneys in the department's civil rights division to monitor developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have not disclosed the name of the man who was killed, but family members say it was Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at the news conference that an officer encountered two people on the street near an apartment complex Saturday afternoon in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn't known, but &quot;it was more than just a couple.&quot; He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer's gun. Police are still investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged and was expected to be interviewed later Sunday. Authorities are not sure whether that person was unarmed, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters about the time the news conference was to begin. At one point, many of them marched into an adjacent police building, some chanting, &quot;Don't shoot me,&quot; while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase but didn't use force; the crowd eventually left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters outside chanted slogans - &quot;No justice, no peace&quot; and &quot;We want answers&quot; - and some carried signs that read &quot;Stop police terrorism&quot; and &quot;Disarm the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're outraged because yet again a young African American man has been killed by law enforcement,&quot; said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP. &quot;This is an issue everywhere in America. You never believe that this can happen in your town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton called the shooting death &quot;very disturbing.&quot; The New York-based civil rights leader said he planned to go to Ferguson to meet with the family Monday night or Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics have contended that police in the St. Louis area too often target young black men. Statistics on police-involved shootings in the region were not immediately available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaskin made comments Saturday alluding to the 2012 shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges, as well as the New York City man who recently died from a police chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer's race has not been disclosed. He has been with the Ferguson Police Department for six years, Belmar said, noting he wasn't aware of other issues involving the officer. He has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is a common procedure after police shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Shahid, a community activist who led Sunday's protest, urged demonstrators to post videos and photos on social media so Monday's planned protests would draw thousands instead of hundreds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not worried about what's happening in Afghanistan,&quot; Shahid said. &quot;We're worried about what's happening in Ferguson . . . black youths being murdered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's grandmother, Desiree Harris, said Saturday she saw him minutes before she heard a commotion and went outside. She found Brown's body less than two blocks away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My grandson never even got into a fight,&quot; she said. &quot;He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several protesters were angry that Brown's body remained on the street for hours after the killing. Belmar said that officers &quot;had to practice our due diligence and that's why it took as long as it did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives have said that Brown was a 2014 Normandy High School graduate who was to begin classes at Vatterott College on Monday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN FRANCISCO -- Symantec Corp. is getting a boost as demand picks up for anti-hacking tools, with revenue and profit topping estimates in the latest quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest computer-security software maker reported sales of $1.74 billion in the fiscal first quarter that ended July 4, it said in a statement Wednesday. Analysts were projecting, on average, $1.67 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rise in computer attacks is spurring sales of anti-virus programs as more people stay online, with global spending on security software and hardware projected to climb 9.1 percent this year to $71.7 billion, according to Gartner Inc. Steady demand for Symantec's products and services are helping the company buy time as it searches for a permanent chief executive officer and faces pressure to sell its data-storage business. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are still the biggest security vendor by far and there are some huge advantages associated with that,&quot; said Patrick Walravens, an analyst at JMP Securities. With the ability to sell to existing customers, &quot;they have the channel, now they need the product to put through it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shares of Mountain View, California-based Symantec declined less than 1 percent to $23.73 at the close in New York, leaving them little changed this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiscal first-quarter profit, excluding certain items, was 45 cents a share, Symantec said. Analysts were predicting a profit of 42 cents. The latest quarter was a week longer than the same period a year earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales of anti-virus software to businesses grew, according to interim Chief Executive Officer Michael Brown, thanks to corporations upgrading their personal computers, a trend that also benefited Intel Corp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Symantec is evaluating the performance of all its business lines as it looks for areas to cut, Brown said in May. The company is seeking a permanent replacement for Steve Bennett, who was fired in March after less than two years on the job. Bennett had cut 1,000 jobs, or 5 percent of staff, and disrupted business by reshuffling the sales force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the current period, which ends in September, Symantec is forecasting profit of 40 cents to 44 cents a share on sales of $1.6 billion to $1.64 billion in the fiscal second quarter. Analysts were predicting profit of 45 cents on revenue of $1.63 billion for the fiscal second quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Symantec's management is under pressure to break up the company as demand slows for conventional anti-virus software, which can't catch the most sophisticated attacks, and the PC industry's yearslong slump erodes one of its main sources of sales. While worldwide PC unit sales fell 1.7 percent in the latest quarter, the smallest quarterly drop in two years, IDC predicts that PC shipments will decline through 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first quarter, net income rose 50 percent to $236 million, or 34 cents a share, from $157 million, or 22 cents, a year earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Symantec has hired JPMorgan Chase to explore its strategic options and defend against activist shareholders, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News in April. Some possible strategies include a buyout by a private equity firm, a breakup and sales of the data-storage unit, or further job cuts to boost profit margins. Such measures could provide &quot;meaningful upside&quot; to the stock, Credit Suisse wrote in an Aug. 5 research note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales in consumer security rose 1.1 percent to $740 million, while corporate security revenue rose 2.7 percent to $345 million and data storage sales rose 1.4 percent to $650 million, Symantec said. Geographically, North America was &quot;very strong,&quot; Europe was &quot;good&quot; and India -- where Symantec has most of its employees -- had a &quot;tremendous quarter,&quot; Brown said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To expand beyond anti-virus software, the company is adding services such as data-breach investigations and threat intelligence. It is also cutting costs. The company could eliminate jobs in customer support as it looks for ways to streamline how help calls are handled, Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown, who previously said he wasn't interested in the permanent CEO job, said his thinking has shifted based on the opportunities he sees for the company. The search committee is interviewing finalists and a decision will be announced next month, Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the board asked me to consider it, I'd really have to think about it carefully,&quot; Brown said. &quot;I see tremendous potential at Symantec.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tulsa, OK</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many preachers stick to the Bible and try to steer clear of the dangerous cultural currents that divide Americans, but Michael Brown wades in with both guns blazing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're losing our freedoms every day. We're a nation with sexual anarchy, a nation with massive political divisions, a nation in massive debt, a nation where marriage has become a meaningless term,&quot; said Brown, who will speak next week at Victory Christian Center's Word Explosion, one of Tulsa's largest annual Christian events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown said a new spate of TV shows feature nudity, polyamory, polygamy, adultery and a &quot;constant flood of pornography.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rising tide of sexual anarchy makes any of us who talk about sexual purity and commitment within marriage sound like extremists,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without God's help, we're in a ship that is sinking very, very fast,&quot; said Brown, author of 25 books, seminary professor, host of a nationally syndicated radio broadcast and one of the leaders in the Brownsville Revival, which drew some 4 million people to a church in Pensacola, Florida, over a five-year period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown linked what he sees as America's decline to a growing hostility to Christian values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the sharp cultural shift in recent years away from traditional biblical standards for marriage has affected Americans' perception of the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that the gay issue has become a civil rights issue, we're being painted as being on the wrong side of a civil rights issue,&quot; he said. &quot;We're the discriminatory ones. We're the bigots, just like the KKK and even the Nazis, who put homosexuals in concentration camps and killed them. That's the way we're being perceived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The media is largely complicit in this, painting highly negative pictures of believing Christians and painting highly positive pictures of anyone who identifies as gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender, with sympathetic, emotional stories,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a recent U.S. government survey put the gay/lesbian/bisexual population in the United States at 2.4 percent, but that a recent Gallup poll suggests Americans' perception is that about 25 percent of the population is gay/lesbian/bisexual, a misconception created by the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another factor affecting the perception people have of the church, he said, is an &quot;aggressive, atheistic assault on the faith. We're now grouped together with religious extremists of all kinds. We're called Christo-fascists. We're just like the Taliban. We're called Christianists, which is to say we're these crazy fundamentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're grouped together with people who really are doing a lot of evil. That's how we are perceived.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the church's declining stature in society is self-inflicted, Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The many scandals in our midst have caused people to take the church less seriously and made it a lot easier for people to attack us,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the church has become complacent and has &quot;longed for the acceptance of the world more than the acceptance of God and has even built a theology that has tried to please people more than please God. ... When you're man-pleasers, that's always going to fail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the church has preached a message &quot;without an emphasis on holiness and repentance, and that has contributed to the moral and spiritual decline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That message, sometime called &quot;hyper-grace,&quot; is widely preached in American churches, he said, and especially appeals to the younger generation &quot;who want to hear a slick, cool message and don't want to be perceived by the world as being full of hate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown defined hyper-grace as the &quot;message of biblical grace with exaggeration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It says the moment you are saved, God not only forgives your sins, but he pronounces all your future sins forgiven, as well. Therefore you never have to repent of sin or ask for forgiveness. ... God doesn't see your sin because you're already forgiven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hyper-grace subscribers say people who preach the need for repentance and turning from sin are legalists - Pharisees, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've watched churches split and ministries collapse because they have embraced this message,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite all this, Brown said, there is hope for the church and for the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news is, if we helped create the problem, we can help fix it. The first thing is to turn to God, seek his face, repent, ask God to clean up our junk ... show the world what it really means to be a follower of Jesus, ... demonstrate the love of God.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five days after a police officer shot 18-year-old Michael Brown dead in St Louis, police have yet to cast any light on the killing or even name the officer who pulled the trigger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the official silence more witnesses have come forward to corroborate the grim story first told by the young man Mr Brown was with when he died, 22-year-old Dorian Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr Johnson, the two young men were walking along a street in the suburb of Ferguson, a small community with its own police force, when officers in a pick-up truck rolled past and ordered them to &quot;get the f--- on the sidewalk&quot;. Mr Johnson says the officer leaned out of the window and grabbed Mr Brown around the neck. The two wrestled, a gun discharged and the boys ran. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police confirm that Mr Brown's body fell 10 metres from the truck. Mr Johnson says Mr Brown was hit once, turned and raised his hands only to be shot several more times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday Tiffany Mitchell, who was driving past as the incident happened, appeared on CNN with her lawyer and said that she observed Mr Brown trying to pull away from the officer as they grappled through the window before running down the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As he runs the police gets out of his vehicle and he follows behind him shooting and the kid's body jerked as if he was hit from behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he turned around and he puts his hands up ... and the cop continues to fire until he dropped down to the ground and his face just smacks into the concrete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each night since Saturday crowds have gathered and police have responded with arrests, tear-gas and rubber bullets. On Wednesday night the nation was shocked by images of police SWAT teams, indistinguishable from combat troops, training weapons on peaceful protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many believe that the police response to the shooting has provoked the continuing tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say Mr Brown's body was left in the street for four hours after he died and no ambulance was called. Ms Mitchell told CNN that when his grieving family arrived they were given no details about what had happened. When she tried to tell them what she saw, police sought to prevent her, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday US President Barack Obama addressed the tensions, offering condolences to Mr Brown's family and calling on the community to &quot;comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is impossible to exaggerate how seriously the US takes the spectre of race riots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In The New York Times on Thursday, columnist Charles Blow captured the sense of despair the incident has provoked among many African-Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is an eerie echo in it all - a sense of tragedy too often repeated. And yet the sheer morbid, wrenching rhythm of it belies a larger phenomenon ... The criminalisation of black and brown bodies - particularly male ones - from the moment they are first introduced to the institutions and power structures with which they must interact,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his officers again met protesters with tear-gas on Wednesday night, St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar congratulated them for their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are doing the best we can to protect life and property, and while it looks remarkable, perhaps, to people across the nation, it should be noted that no protester has been injured and only one police officer was injured, and he suffered a twisted ankle,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cold comfort to Michael Brown's family.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri state police will take charge of security in the town of Ferguson, the state governor said Thursday, after local officers shot dead an unarmed teenager, triggering four days of violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lately it looks like a war zone and that is not acceptable,&quot; Governor Jay Nixon said of -Ferguson, outside St Louis, where county police have been criticised for their military-style crackdown on protests in which another teen was left critically injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will all need to join hands to rebuild the trust that's been lost and help this community regain its stability,&quot; Nixon said, appointing a local African-American officer, Captain Ron Johnson, to take charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, an 18-year-old African-American who was due to start college two days -later, was shot dead by county police on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses and police have given conflicting versions of how the fatal shot was fired, and -anger over the killing triggered angry protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local officers responded by donning military-style combat uniforms, arming themselves with assault rifles, tear gas and rubber bullets, and sending armoured vehicles to crush dissent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reaction was criticised as heavy-handed and over-militarised by critics from across the political spectrum - from civil rights leaders to Republican -Senator Rand Paul to President Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon reacted today by standing down the St Louis County police who had led the crackdown, and drafting in the Missouri Highway Patrol, which answers to the state government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said police would show respect to the citizens as they try to restore calm and &quot;break this cycle of violence&quot;.Despite pleas from protesters, control of the investigation into the police shooting of Brown will remain in the hands of the St Louis County force.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri state police will take charge of security in the town of Ferguson, the state governor said Thursday, after local officers shot dead an unarmed teenager, triggering four days of violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lately it looks like a war zone and that is not acceptable,&quot; Governor Jay Nixon said of -Ferguson, outside St Louis, where county police have been criticised for their military-style crackdown on protests in which another teen was left critically injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will all need to join hands to rebuild the trust that's been lost and help this community regain its stability,&quot; Nixon said, appointing a local African-American officer, Captain Ron Johnson, to take charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, an 18-year-old African-American who was due to start college two days -later, was shot dead by county police on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses and police have given conflicting versions of how the fatal shot was fired, and -anger over the killing triggered angry protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local officers responded by donning military-style combat uniforms, arming themselves with assault rifles, tear gas and rubber bullets, and sending armoured vehicles to crush dissent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reaction was criticised as heavy-handed and over-militarised by critics from across the political spectrum - from civil rights leaders to Republican -Senator Rand Paul to President Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon reacted today by standing down the St Louis County police who had led the crackdown, and drafting in the Missouri Highway Patrol, which answers to the state government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said police would show respect to the citizens as they try to restore calm and &quot;break this cycle of violence&quot;.Despite pleas from protesters, control of the investigation into the police shooting of Brown will remain in the hands of the St Louis County force.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, MO. (AP) &amp;GT;&amp;GT; A suburban St. Louis police chief today identified the officer whose fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager ignited days of heated protests, and released documents alleging the teen was killed after a robbery in which he was suspected of stealing a $48.99 box of cigars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released several police reports and documents during a news conference where he also identified the officer involved as Darren Wilson, who has been on administrative leave since he shot 18-year-old Michael Brown on Aug. 9. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, were suspected of taking a box of cigars from a store in Ferguson that morning, according to police reports. Jackson said Wilson went to the area after a 911 call reporting a &quot;strong-arm&quot; robbery just before noon. He said a dispatcher gave a description of the robbery suspect, and Wilson, who had been assisting on another call, was sent to investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson, a six-year veteran of the police department, encountered Brown just after 12:01 p.m., with a second officer arriving three minutes later, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's uncle, Bernard Ewing, questioned whether Wilson really believed Brown was a suspect. He noted Johnson's account that the officer told the two young men to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk, and that Brown had his hands up when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he's a robbery suspect, they would have had the lights on,&quot; Ewing said. &quot;If you rob somebody, you would tell them, 'Get on the ground' or something, not, 'Get off the sidewalk.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It still doesn't justify shooting him when he puts his hands up,&quot; he added. &quot;You still don't shoot him in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A phone message seeking comment from the family's attorney, Benjamin Crump, wasn't immediately returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's death has sparked several days of clashes with furious protesters in the city. The mood was quelled on Thursday after the governor turned oversight of the protests over to the state Highway Patrol. State troopers walking side-by-side with thousands of peaceful protesters replaced the image of previous nights: county police in riot gear and armored tanks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the police chief's announcement today was met with immediate disbelief and anger by several dozen community members who also attended the news conference, which was hastily held at a gas station burned during a night of looting earlier in the week in Ferguson, a town of 21,000 that is nearly 70 percent black and patrolled by a nearly all-white police force</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He stopped the wrong one, bottom line,&quot; yelled Tatinisha Wheeler, a nurse's aide who was at the news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple dozen protesters began marching around the charred gas station and in the street chanting, &quot;Hands up, don't shoot,&quot; and, &quot;What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street during a routine patrol. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times, according to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson has told media a different story. He said he and Brown were walking in the street when an officer ordered them onto the sidewalk, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He said Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions in Ferguson boiled over after a candlelight vigil Sunday night, as looters smashed and burned businesses in the neighborhood, where police have repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Thursday, there was a dramatic shift in the atmosphere after Gov. Jay Nixon assigned protest oversight to Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black and grew up near Ferguson. He marched alongside protesters, along with other high-ranking brass from the Highway Patrol and the St. Louis County Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're here to serve and protect,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;We're not here to instill fear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter. When darkness fell   the point at which previous protests have grown tense   no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All they did was look at us and shoot tear gas,&quot; Pedro Smith, who has participated in the nightly protests, said Thursday. &quot;This is totally different. Now we're being treated with respect.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Rip Van Winkle who fell asleep in 1968, awakening now, would see TV news footage that was achingly familiar: An American city under siege as mostly white police officers, firing tear gas, face off against mostly black civilian protestors, some violent but most just angry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two elections of a black president notwithstanding, some things haven't changed very much. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those areas where little progress has been made is the criminal justice system, which still reeks of institutional racism and a plethora of human prejudices. Black men, especially, are viewed as dangerous, predatory, criminally inclined. They are not usually given the benefit of the doubt   not viewed as innocent until proven guilty   by white police officers, prosecutors or jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That helps explain the anger that has exploded in Ferguson, Missouri, where black residents make up 67 percent of the population but black drivers accounted for more than 86 percent of the traffic stops last year, according to a report by the Missouri Attorney General. Police in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, searched 12.1 percent of black drivers they stopped, compared to 6.9 percent for whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are black drivers more likely to carry illegal substances? No. Contraband was found 22 percent of the time when the driver was black and 34 percent when the driver was white. The police department, by the way, has three blacks among its 53 officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The troubling racial disparities do not absolve the looters, the rioters, the thugs who have attacked police and damaged property since protests began. There is no excuse for criminal conduct. Moreover, it detracts from legitimate gripes with the police. Those who use the protests as cover to steal or toss Molotov cocktails should be arrested and prosecuted aggressively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it's also true that police officers, sworn to protect the public, have a duty to act without causing more harm. Let's remember how the troubles began: An unarmed black man, 18-year-old Michael Brown, was shot dead by a police officer. What brought this young man to the cop's attention? Was he breaking into a car or assaulting a passerby? Nope. He was walking in the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer who shot Brown after ordering him to the sidewalk claims he was attacked and a struggle for his gun ensued. However, one of Brown's friends, a witness, tells a very different version of events. President Barack Obama, while calling for calm, said he had ordered a federal investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a step in the right direction, but it's not nearly enough. If demands for justice come mostly from black voters, if a thorough investigation is seen as a predictable political response from a black U.S. Attorney General, if outrage is voiced only by the talking heads at the liberal outpost of MSNBC, then there will be many more Fergusons to come. The overuse of force by heavily militarized police ought to concern every American, not just those most likely to be on the butt ends of police rifles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's clear, no matter the details of Brown's death, that local police have handled the aftermath poorly, inflaming tensions with excessive force. Heavily armed officers in desert camouflage have pointed large-caliber weapons at peaceful protestors. A couple of reporters were arrested while covering the news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is any good news here, it's this: The sense of outrage seems to have finally broken out of the usual bounds of race and partisanship. In an essay published in Time, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) wrote: &quot;The outrage in Ferguson is understandable   though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De-militarizing police departments won't rid the criminal justice system of endemic racism, but it may help to curb the unnecessary, violent confrontations by officers who have forgotten their oaths to &quot;protect and serve.&quot; And that could keep a few more young black men alive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five days after a police officer shot 18-year-old Michael Brown dead in St Louis, police have yet to cast any light on the killing or even name the officer who pulled the trigger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the official silence more witnesses have come forward to corroborate the grim story first told by the young man Mr Brown was with when he died, 22-year-old Dorian Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr Johnson, the two young men were walking along a street in the suburb of Ferguson, a small community with its own police force, when officers in a pick-up truck rolled past and ordered them to &quot;get the f--- on the sidewalk&quot;. Mr Johnson says the officer leaned out of the window and grabbed Mr Brown around the neck. The two wrestled, a gun discharged and the boys ran. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police confirm that Mr Brown's body fell 10 metres from the truck. Mr Johnson says Mr Brown was hit once, turned and raised his hands only to be shot several more times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday Tiffany Mitchell, who was driving past as the incident happened, appeared on CNN with her lawyer and said that she observed Mr Brown trying to pull away from the officer as they grappled through the window before running down the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As he runs the police gets out of his vehicle and he follows behind him shooting and the kid's body jerked as if he was hit from behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he turned around and he puts his hands up ... and the cop continues to fire until he dropped down to the ground and his face just smacks into the concrete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each night since Saturday crowds have gathered and police have responded with arrests, tear-gas and rubber bullets. On Wednesday night the nation was shocked by images of police SWAT teams, indistinguishable from combat troops, training weapons on peaceful protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many believe that the police response to the shooting has provoked the continuing tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say Mr Brown's body was left in the street for four hours after he died and no ambulance was called. Ms Mitchell told CNN that when his grieving family arrived they were given no details about what had happened. When she tried to tell them what she saw, police sought to prevent her, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday US President Barack Obama addressed the tensions, offering condolences to Mr Brown's family and calling on the community to &quot;comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is impossible to exaggerate how seriously the US takes the spectre of race riots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In The New York Times on Thursday, columnist Charles Blow captured the sense of despair the incident has provoked among many African-Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is an eerie echo in it all - a sense of tragedy too often repeated. And yet the sheer morbid, wrenching rhythm of it belies a larger phenomenon ... The criminalisation of black and brown bodies - particularly male ones - from the moment they are first introduced to the institutions and power structures with which they must interact,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his officers again met protesters with tear-gas on Wednesday night, St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar congratulated them for their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are doing the best we can to protect life and property, and while it looks remarkable, perhaps, to people across the nation, it should be noted that no protester has been injured and only one police officer was injured, and he suffered a twisted ankle,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cold comfort to Michael Brown's family.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawyer said Thursday that he plans to file a wrongful death suit on behalf of the family of a black man who was fatally shot by two Los Angeles Police Department officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police, in a preliminary account, said a man, whom family and the attorney identified as 25-year-old  mentally challenged  Ezell Ford was shot about 8:10 p.m. Monday in South Los Angeles after he grabbed an officer and attempted to remove a gun from his holster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe the contact with my client s son unnecessarily led to an out-of-policy shooting, which is excessive force and forms the basis of a wrongful death claim ... pursuant to the basic civil rights statute,  said attorney Steven A. Lerman, who represented Rodney King. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday evening, hundreds turned out for a march along Broadway to demonstrate outrage over the shooting. Although tensions were high, with many expressing anger with police, the march remained peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators, carrying signs   many with  Don t shoot  written on them   and chanting  Justice for Ezell Ford. Justice for Michael Brown,  started at the scene of Monday s shooting on 65th Street, just east of Broadway, and headed to LAPD s 77th Street station and back, with LAPD blocking vehicles on Broadway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar demonstrations were held throughout the country to protest police killings, including that of Brown, an unarmed teen police fatally shot in Ferguson, Mo., with #NMOS14 , or National Moment of Silence 2014, being used on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Newton Area Gang Enforcement officers were driving westbound on 65th Street near Broadway when they came upon the man identified as Ford as he was walking on a sidewalk. When the officers attempted to stop him for unknown reasons, he turned, grabbed one of the officers and a struggle ensued, according to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After they fell to the ground and the man attempted to remove the officer s handgun from its holster, the officer s partner shot him  believing there was an imminent threat of danger  and then the officer on the ground  fired  his backup weapon, LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man who said he was Ezell Ford s brother said his brother  didn t deserve this.  He declined to comment further and wouldn t give his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the march, demonstrators lit candles and observed a moment of silence to honor Ford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lerman, who plans to file the wrongful death suit in federal court in the coming week, called the confrontation deadly and violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I can t see why a taser couldn t have been used or a bean bag gun, which the officers are equipped with,  he said.  I believe the officers knew this individual and knew he had mental problems. I believe that alone should have made them more aware of how to treat him properly so he doesn t end up dead on a sidewalk right by his house. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the medical record and witnesses in the neighborhood will attest that Ford was receiving medication for some mental issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lerman said he s hiring an investigative team made up of former law enforcement and FBI officials to probe the matter and to  offer proof in federal court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man, Leroy Hill, told the Huffington Post that he witnessed the incident. He said the officers were beating Ford and he didn t know why because  he didn t do nothing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident is being investigated by the LAPD s Force Investigation Division, with the inspector general and the district attorney monitoring the probe and ensuring it is complete and unbiased, said Tyler Izen, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If a suspect s behavior is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death, an officer can, by law and under LAPD policy, use deadly force,  Izen said in a statement.  In using deadly force, officers can fire their weapons only to stop deadly threats to keep themselves and the public safe, and can continue to fire until the threat has ended. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAPD is asking for any witnesses, including those who may have physical evidence such as video, to contact the department or the Office of the Inspector General. LAPD investigators have asked that the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner place an investigative hold on the pending autopsy report, according to a statement released Thursday night.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, MO. (AP) &amp;GT;&amp;GT; Police used tear gas and smoke bombs to repel crowds who threw Molotov cocktails during another violent night on the streets of a St. Louis suburb in the wake of the shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours earlier, the police chief had said race relations were the top priority in the town, where a white police officer fatally shot the black teen. Authorities have vowed to reach across the racial, economic and generational divide in a community in search of answers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the streets of Ferguson, though, the polite dialogue heard at community forums and news conferences is nowhere to be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, officers from multiple departments in riot gear and in military equipment have clashed nightly with protesters, who chant, &quot;Hands up, don't shoot.&quot; Wednesday saw more tense confrontations and further volleys of tear gas from police   this time paired with smoke bombs in response to flaming projectiles and other objects lobbed from the crowd. Protesters faced heavily armed police who at times trained weapons on them from armored trucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two reporters said they were detained by police for not clearing out quickly enough from a McDonald's where they were working, near the protests but away from the more volatile areas. The two, who work for The Washington Post and The Huffington Post, were released without any charges. Both say they were assaulted but not seriously hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that about 10 people had been arrested, including St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has been chronicling the protests on social media. Police had said earlier they would not have arrest information until early today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House said President Barack Obama   who is on vacation on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard   was briefed late Wednesday on the situation in Ferguson by Attorney General Eric Holder and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents in Ferguson have complained about what they called a heavy-handed police presence that began with the use of dogs for crowd control soon after Brown's shooting   a tactic that for some invoked the specter of civil rights protests a half-century ago. The county police force took over leading both the investigation of Brown's shooting and the subsequent attempts to keep the peace at the smaller city's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County Police Chief Jon Belmar, though, said his officers have responded with &quot;an incredible amount of restraint,&quot; as they've been the targets of rocks, bottles and gunshots, with two dozen patrol vehicles being destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police had also asked earlier that people assemble in &quot;an organized and respectful&quot; manner and disperse before evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer involved in Brown's shooting, citing threats against that officer and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson called improving race relations &quot;the top priority right now&quot; but also said he won't be pressured into publicly identifying the officer   despite, he said, mounting demands from clergy, computer hackers and protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have the right to know, and the family has the right to know who murdered their son,&quot; said Sahari Gutierrez, a 27-year-old Ferguson legal assistant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said he welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force's 53 officers are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon cited the &quot;worsening situation&quot; in Ferguson in saying he would be in the area Thursday. He asked community members to be patient and calm while the investigation proceeds and urged law enforcement agencies to &quot;keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said the investigation remains weeks away from completion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. In their initial news conference about the shooting, police didn't specify whether Brown was the person who scuffled with the officer in the car and have refused to clarify their account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said Wednesday that the officer involved sustained swelling facial injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it &quot;ricocheted&quot; back, apparently upsetting the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the protesters critical of the police response has been state Sen. Maria Chapelle-Nadal, a Democrat from nearby University City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just want to know if I'm going to be gassed again, like I was on Monday night?&quot; she asked Jackson at a press conference. &quot;And I was peaceful. And I'm your state senator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope not,&quot; he replied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police spokesman said Wednesday that a man who was fatally shot by two officers in South Los Angeles Monday night during a struggle had attempted to remove a gun from an officer s holster, a preliminary account that conflicts with statements made by the man s family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members told KTLA (Channel 5) on Tuesday that the 25-year-old man, whom they identified as Ezell Ford, was complying with Los Angeles Police Department officers  orders when he was shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said Wednesday that two veteran officers from the Newtown Division, who work gang detail, were driving their patrol car in the area of 65th Street and Broadway when they saw the man walking on a sidewalk, stopped their car and exited to talk to him. As the officers approached and made eye contact with the man, he continued to walk  making several suspicious movements, which include an apparent attempt to conceal his hands,  Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the officers attempted to stop him at some point, the man spun around, grabbed one of the officers and both the man and the officer fell down to the ground, Smith said. There was then a struggle with the  suspect on top of our officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We got two officers, one involved in a fight underneath the suspect   the suspect was on top of him,  Smith said.  It appears the suspect was attempting to pull a gun out of the (officer s)holster. The partner shoots the suspect. (Then) the officer underneath pulls his backup weapon while holding on to his primary weapon and shoots the suspect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all of the Police Department s patrol cars are equipped yet with video cameras and this particular car was not equipped, Smith said. Although a pilot program is underway in the Central Division in which officers are equipped with cameras on their bodies, nothing like that exists in the Newton Division, he said. Both officers were assigned home duty until the chief can make a decision on their status, which is expected to happen today, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tritobia Ford, who identified herself as the man s mother, told KTLA Tuesday that her son was lying on the ground, complying with the officers  commands, when he was shot three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My heart is so heavy,  she said.  My son was a good kid. He didn t deserve to die the way he did. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man who identified himself only as a cousin told the TV station there was no reason for the  excessive force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications,  the man said.  Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division knows that   that this child has mental problems. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earl Ofari Hutchinson of the Los Angeles Urban Roundtable, who along with other civil rights leaders has called for a meeting with Chief Charlie Beck over the matter, said he wants an investigation that is  swift, speedy, fair and impartial and most importantly transparent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Typically, these investigations drag on weeks and weeks and months on months,  Hutchinson said.  We are not interested in that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., a man killed by a police offer s chokehold after allegedly selling black market cigarettes in New York and the beating of Marlene Pinnock by a CHP officer in Los Angeles   in which all the victims were black    there has to be a sense of urgency,  he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A protest organized by those concerned about the shooting is slated for 3 p.m. Sunday at Police Department headquarters at 100 W. First St., according to a Facebook page .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly quoted LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith as saying the partner shot the officer. In fact, he shot the suspect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days after a young black man was shot dead by police, the tension on the streets of St Louis, Missouri, remains high. Still, nobody seems quite sure what happened. All that is certain is Michael Brown, 18, was unarmed when he was shot several times just after 2pm on Saturday in the suburb of Ferguson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St Louis County Police Department chief Jon Belmar said officers &quot;had an encounter&quot; with Mr Brown, during which the youth pushed an officer and reached for his gun. &quot;It is our understanding at this point in the investigation that there was a struggle over the officer's weapon. There was at least one shot fired in the car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Brown was found dead more than 10 metres from the car and, according to his mother, was shot eight times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Piaget Crenshaw, a young local woman, told a local Fox station Mr Brown was walking with a friend, Dorin Johnson, to his grandmother's apartment when an officer in a car ordered them to get off the road. After a verbal altercation, the officer shot Mr Brown dead as Mr Johnson hid behind a car. Mr Brown graduated from high school this year and was to start classes at a technical college on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the shooting, events followed a tragically familiar path. Soon the streets had filled with protesters, some yelling &quot;kill the police&quot;. Fearing a riot, police flooded the streets with officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday night the riot broke out. According to reports, a dozen or so businesses were vandalised or looted, two officers injured and 32 people arrested. On Monday the streets were again calm but tension remains high, especially as an autopsy report is soon to be made public. Angered that media appear to select photos of young black men in the news that make them look menacing, thousands have posted dual photos of Mr Brown or themselves online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One post shows Mr Brown looking streetwise beside another of him looking comfortable in a class. Another typical post shows a photo of a young man throwing a gang sign beside another of him in military uniform reading to children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting comes as civil rights organisations prepare for protests in New York over the death of Eric Garner, 43, who died after police allegedly used an illegal &quot;chokehold&quot; on him while arresting him for selling single cigarettes on the street.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, MO. (AP) &amp;GT;&amp;GT; Nights of unrest have vied with calls for calm in a St. Louis suburb where an unarmed black teenager was killed by police, while the community is still pressing for answers about the weekend shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of residents packed two churches Tuesday evening for community meetings about the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was confronted by a Ferguson officer while walking with a friend in the street near his grandmother's home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People also gathered in the streets Tuesday night, shouting at police. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that police again fired tear gas into a crowd. One person was injured in a drive-by shooting, although it was not clear if the shooting was related to the protests. The Post-Dispatch also reported that a St. Louis County police officer shot and critically wounded a man who authorities said pulled a handgun on the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal shooting of Brown has exposed deep racial and economic fault lines in the community. At one church gathering with dozens of clergy members and elected officials, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon urged calm &quot;in the face of crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We stand together tonight, reeling from what feels like an old wound torn open afresh,&quot; Nixon said. &quot;A wound that hadn't quite healed right in the first place, and now the pain is just as searing as when the injury first occurred.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other church rally featured the Rev. Al Sharpton, who earlier in the day pressed police to release the name of the police officer involved   but also pleaded for calm after a night of looting and vandalism and instances of police using tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The local authorities have put themselves in a position   hiding names and not being transparent   where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation,&quot; Sharpton said at a news conference with Brown's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson police initially planned to release the name of the officer, who is on administrative leave, on Tuesday. But they said death threats to its officers prompted them to withhold it. Computer hackers have also targeted the city's website and released details online about individual city employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we come out and say, 'It was this officer,' then he immediately becomes a target,&quot; Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said. &quot;We're taking the threats seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white. The Ferguson police force has 53 officers, three of whom are black. Jackson said the city has had trouble recruiting and retaining black officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators have released few details about the deadly encounter, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer on a routine patrol asked Brown and another teen to get out of the street on Saturday afternoon. At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, according to the St. Louis County Police Department, which is handling the investigation at the smaller city's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred protesters rallied Tuesday morning in the county seat of Clayton, urging St. Louis County's prosecutor to file criminal charges against the Ferguson officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., said at the news conference to &quot;come together and do this right ... no violence.&quot; President Barack Obama also urged calm, saying people must comfort each other &quot;in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson's mayor and police chief were among the speakers at the meeting Nixon attended. Both were welcomed with polite applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum was intended as an alternative response after two nights of unrest in which crowds had burned stores, vandalized vehicles, assaulted reporters and taunted officers. Organizers shared plans for numerous nonviolent responses, such as a prayer walk planned to mark the one-week anniversary of Brown's death and assembling teams of greeters to welcome back students at the high school from which Brown recently graduated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fullest account of Brown's death so far has come from Dorian Johnson, who said he was walking home with Brown when they were approached by an officer in a squad car who ordered them to move to the sidewalk. Johnson told news crews that he and Brown kept walking and the officer then reversed his car &quot;to where it almost hit us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer, Johnson said, tried to open his door, but it &quot;ricocheted&quot; back. Johnson said the officer reached through the window, &quot;grabbed my friend around the neck&quot; and tried to pull him into the car. The officer then reportedly pulled out his weapon and said, &quot;'I'll shoot you,' or 'I'm going to shoot,'&quot; Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the officer opened fire, Brown was hit, said Johnson, who hid behind a car. Brown kept running, Johnson said. Johnson said the officer pursued Brown and fired again. When Brown felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down on the ground. The officer kept firing, Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said there is no security or police video of the confrontation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A riot can be many things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be an act of communal madness, reflecting the emotional imbecility of those who believe the best way to express joy at their ball team's win is to overturn a car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be an act of opportunism, a chance, under cover of darkness, influence of chaos, suspension of order, to smash and grab and run away, arms heavy with loot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it can be an act of outcry, a scream of inchoate rage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what happened this week in Ferguson, Missouri. The people screamed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To believe that this carnage -- the windows smashed, the buildings torched, the tear gas wafting -- is all about the killing of Michael Brown is to miss the point. Brown, of course, was the unarmed 18-year-old African-American man shot multiple times by a Ferguson police officer on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar -- Ferguson Police asked his department, as an outside agency, to investigate the shooting -- has said Brown was walking with another individual when a so-far unnamed officer sitting in a police car, stopped him. According to Belmar, the officer was trying to get out of his car when one of the two individuals pushed him back inside, where there was a struggle over the officer's weapon and at least one shot was discharged. He says the officer came out of the car and fired, striking Brown, who was about 35 feet away, multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses say Brown, who was to have started college this week, had his hands up when he was shot. Police have not said why the officer felt the need to stop him in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details are still too sketchy for us to draw hard conclusions about what happened that afternoon. But it is all too easy to understand what happened afterward and why good people should be paying attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because, again, this is not just about Brown. It's about Eric Garner, choked to death in a confrontation with New York City Police. It's about Jordan Davis, shot to death in Jacksonville, Florida, because he played his music too loud. It's about Trayvon Martin, shot to death in Sanford, Florida, because a self-appointed neighborhood guardian judged him a thug. It's about Oscar Grant, shot by a police officer in an Oakland, California, subway station as cellphone cameras watched. It's about Amadou Diallo, executed in that vestibule and Abner Louima, sodomized with that broomstick. It's about Rodney King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is about the bitter sense of siege that lives in African-American men, a sense that it is perpetually open season on us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that too few people outside of African America really notice, much less care. People who look like you are everyday deprived of health, wealth, freedom, opportunity, education, the benefit of the doubt, the presumption of innocence, life itself -- and when you try to say this, even when you document it with academic studies and buttress it with witness testimony, people don't want to hear it, people dismiss you, deny you, lecture you about white victimhood, chastise you for playing a so-called &quot;race card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They choke off avenues of protest, prizing silence over justice, mistaking silence for peace. And never mind that sometimes, silence simmers like water in a closed pot on a high flame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One can never condone a riot. It is a self-defeating act that sells some fleeting illusion of satisfaction at a high cost in property and life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But understanding this does not preclude recognizing that the anger we see in Ferguson did not spring from nowhere, nor arrive, fully-formed, when Michael Brown was shot. It is the anger of people who are, as Fannie Lou Hamer famously said, sick and tired of being sick and tired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silence imposed on pain cannot indefinitely endure. People who are hurting will always, eventually, make themselves heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if they must scream to do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days after a young black man was shot dead by police, the tension on the streets of St Louis, Missouri, remains high. Still, nobody seems quite sure what happened. All that is certain is Michael Brown, 18, was unarmed when he was shot several times just after 2pm on Saturday in the suburb of Ferguson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St Louis County Police Department chief Jon Belmar said officers &quot;had an encounter&quot; with Mr Brown, during which the youth pushed an officer and reached for his gun. &quot;It is our understanding at this point in the investigation that there was a struggle over the officer's weapon. There was at least one shot fired in the car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Brown was found dead more than 10 metres from the car and, according to his mother, was shot eight times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Piaget Crenshaw, a young local woman, told a local Fox station Mr Brown was walking with a friend, Dorin Johnson, to his grandmother's apartment when an officer in a car ordered them to get off the road. After a verbal altercation, the officer shot Mr Brown dead as Mr Johnson hid behind a car. Mr Brown graduated from high school this year and was to start classes at a technical college on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the shooting, events followed a tragically familiar path. Soon the streets had filled with protesters, some yelling &quot;kill the police&quot;. Fearing a riot, police flooded the streets with officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday night the riot broke out. According to reports, a dozen or so businesses were vandalised or looted, two officers injured and 32 people arrested. On Monday the streets were again calm but tension remains high, especially as an autopsy report is soon to be made public. Angered that media appear to select photos of young black men in the news that make them look menacing, thousands have posted dual photos of Mr Brown or themselves online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One post shows Mr Brown looking streetwise beside another of him looking comfortable in a class. Another typical post shows a photo of a young man throwing a gang sign beside another of him in military uniform reading to children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting comes as civil rights organisations prepare for protests in New York over the death of Eric Garner, 43, who died after police allegedly used an illegal &quot;chokehold&quot; on him while arresting him for selling single cigarettes on the street.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police spokesman said Wednesday that a man who was fatally shot by two officers in South Los Angeles Monday night during a struggle had attempted to remove a gun from an officer s holster, a preliminary account that conflicts with statements made by the man s family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members told KTLA (Channel 5) on Tuesday that the 25-year-old man, whom they identified as Ezell Ford, was complying with Los Angeles Police Department officers  orders when he was shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said Wednesday that two veteran officers from the Newtown Division, who work gang detail, were driving their patrol car in the area of 65th Street and Broadway when they saw the man walking on a sidewalk, stopped their car and exited to talk to him. As the officers approached and made eye contact with the man, he continued to walk  making several suspicious movements, which include an apparent attempt to conceal his hands,  Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the officers attempted to stop him at some point, the man spun around, grabbed one of the officers and both the man and the officer fell down to the ground, Smith said. There was then a struggle with the  suspect on top of our officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We got two officers, one involved in a fight underneath the suspect   the suspect was on top of him,  Smith said.  It appears the suspect was attempting to pull a gun out of the holster. The partner shoots the officer. The officer underneath pulls his backup weapon while holding on to his primary weapon and shoots the suspect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all of the police department s patrol cars are equipped yet with video cameras and this particular car was not equipped, Smith said. Although a pilot program is underway in the Central Division in which officers are equipped with cameras on their bodies, nothing like that exists in the Newton Division, he said. Both officers were assigned home duty until the chief can made a decision on their status, which is expected to happen today, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tritobia Ford, who identified herself as the man s mother, told KTLA Tuesday that her son was lying on the ground, complying with the officers  commands, when he was shot three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My heart is so heavy,  she said.  My son was a good kid. He didn t deserve to die the way he did. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man who identified himself only as a cousin told the TV station there was no reason for the  excessive force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications,  the man said.  Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division knows that   that this child has mental problems. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earl Ofari Hutchinson of the Los Angeles Urban Roundtable, who along with other civil rights leaders has called for a meeting with Chief Charlie Beck over the matter, said he wants an investigation that is  swift, speedy, fair and impartial and most importantly transparent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Typically, these investigations drag on weeks and weeks and months on months,  Hutchinson said.  We are not interested in that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., a man killed by a police offer s chokehold after allegedly selling black market cigarettes in New York and the beating of Marlene Pinnock by a CHP officer in Los Angeles   in which all the victims were black    there has to be a sense of urgency,  he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A protest organized by those concerned about the shooting is slated for 3 p.m. Sunday at Police Department headquarters at 100 W. First St., according to a Facebook page .</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST LOUIS: A violent riot and looting has erupted in Missouri, after a protest over the killing of an unarmed black teen descended into chaos. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds of protesters broke windows of cars and stores after a day of demonstrations over the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black teenager who was shot dead on Saturday by a police officer in the predominantly black neighbourhood of Ferguson, located a few miles north of downtown St Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time he was shot, Brown was unarmed and allegedly surrendering with his hands in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police officer shot him several times, killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the St Louis County Police Department's chief, who is handling the investigation, says Brown assaulted the officer and struggled over the policeman's weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer who shot Brown is on paid leave while the shooting is investigated. On Sunday evening, 30 minutes before a vigil was to be held for Brown, protesters became &quot;aggressive&quot;, according to a news report. A riot then broke out, sending locals inside and running for cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are currently experiencing a riot,&quot; a Ferguson police dispatcher said. St Louis County Police called for more assistance from all surrounding municipalities including St Louis City and the Missouri Highway Patrol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to local reports, several businesses were looted, demonstrators blocked traffic and a civilian was severely beaten. Police in riot gear and the State Trooper SWAT Unit were called out after looters targeted a petrol station and other nearby stores, including a Walmart.Hours after the riots started, police managed to arrest some of the looters who started the violence.</SPAN></P>
