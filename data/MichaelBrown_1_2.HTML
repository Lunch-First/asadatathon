<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawyer said Thursday that he plans to file a wrongful death suit on behalf of the family of a black man who was fatally shot by two Los Angeles Police Department officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police, in a preliminary account, said a man, whom family and the attorney identified as 25-year-old  mentally challenged  Ezell Ford was shot about 8:10 p.m. Monday in South Los Angeles after he grabbed an officer and attempted to remove a gun from his holster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe the contact with my client s son unnecessarily led to an out-of-policy shooting, which is excessive force and forms the basis of a wrongful death claim ... pursuant to the basic civil rights statute,  said attorney Steven A. Lerman, who represented Rodney King. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday evening, hundreds turned out for a march along Broadway to demonstrate outrage over the shooting. Although tensions were high, with many expressing anger with police, the march remained peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators, carrying signs   many with  Don t shoot  written on them   and chanting  Justice for Ezell Ford. Justice for Michael Brown,  started at the scene of Monday s shooting on 65th Street, just east of Broadway, and headed to LAPD s 77th Street station and back, with LAPD blocking vehicles on Broadway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar demonstrations were held throughout the country to protest police killings, including that of Brown, an unarmed teen police fatally shot in Ferguson, Mo., with #NMOS14 , or National Moment of Silence 2014, being used on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Newton Area Gang Enforcement officers were driving westbound on 65th Street near Broadway when they came upon the man identified as Ford as he was walking on a sidewalk. When the officers attempted to stop him for unknown reasons, he turned, grabbed one of the officers and a struggle ensued, according to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After they fell to the ground and the man attempted to remove the officer s handgun from its holster, the officer s partner shot him  believing there was an imminent threat of danger  and then the officer on the ground  fired  his backup weapon, LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man who said he was Ezell Ford s brother said his brother  didn t deserve this.  He declined to comment further and wouldn t give his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the march, demonstrators lit candles and observed a moment of silence to honor Ford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lerman, who plans to file the wrongful death suit in federal court in the coming week, called the confrontation deadly and violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I can t see why a taser couldn t have been used or a bean bag gun, which the officers are equipped with,  he said.  I believe the officers knew this individual and knew he had mental problems. I believe that alone should have made them more aware of how to treat him properly so he doesn t end up dead on a sidewalk right by his house. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the medical record and witnesses in the neighborhood will attest that Ford was receiving medication for some mental issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lerman said he s hiring an investigative team made up of former law enforcement and FBI officials to probe the matter and to  offer proof in federal court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man, Leroy Hill, told the Huffington Post that he witnessed the incident. He said the officers were beating Ford and he didn t know why because  he didn t do nothing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident is being investigated by the LAPD s Force Investigation Division, with the inspector general and the district attorney monitoring the probe and ensuring it is complete and unbiased, said Tyler Izen, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If a suspect s behavior is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death, an officer can, by law and under LAPD policy, use deadly force,  Izen said in a statement.  In using deadly force, officers can fire their weapons only to stop deadly threats to keep themselves and the public safe, and can continue to fire until the threat has ended. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAPD is asking for any witnesses, including those who may have physical evidence such as video, to contact the department or the Office of the Inspector General. LAPD investigators have asked that the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner place an investigative hold on the pending autopsy report, according to a statement released Thursday night.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- About 500 people gathered Thursday afternoon in downtown Oakland for a moment of silence for victims of police brutality and to remember Michael Brown, the teen whose fatal shooting by police has rocked a suburb of St. Louis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group gathered in Oakland fell silent at 4:20 p.m. for about 10 minutes, many with their heads bowed and clutching a small lit white candle. The quiet was broken as dozens of people began raising their hands and chanting &quot;Hands up, don't shoot,&quot; a refrain used by protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, as they stood before police dressed in riot gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signs at the rally called for justice for Michael Brown and for Oscar Grant III, who was shot and killed by a BART police officer in 2009, and Alan Blueford, shot and killed by an Oakland police officer in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blueford's mother, Jeralynn, told the crowd that Brown's killing had reopened emotional wounds she suffered when her son was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not 'Protect and serve,' this is 'Shoot to kill,' and I can't get my Alan back,&quot; Blueford said. &quot;But I can stand up and say, 'I'm not taking anymore.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(Michael Brown's) life mattered. I'm Mike Brown. I am Alan Blueford. You can't shoot these kids down with their hands up. ... None of these people deserved that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Moment of Silence for Victims of Police Brutality, organized online, listed 90 vigils across the country that would participate with a moment of silence and solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event at Oakland's Frank Ogawa Plaza was mirrored across the bay at San Francisco Civic Center and in cities across the country, including Chicago, Philadelphia and New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been so many incidents,&quot; said Kristen Hanley Cardozo, who drove to Oakland from Albany with her children to attend the gathering. &quot;We felt it was so important to be here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berkeley resident Maya Wagoner said she came to support Brown and his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a person,&quot; said Wagoner, 22. &quot;And I wanted to be with people who are also upset about this. To know someone can be shot down on the street for being black is frightening. Something needs to be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gabriella Coleman , who teaches at McGill University in Montreal and studies Anonymous, the hacktivist group. A Twitter account appearing to be with Anonymous on Thursday disclosed the name of who it said was the police officer who shot unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, over the weekend. The name does not match the name of the officer the police department released today: Darren Wilson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Twitter account that released the incorrect name, @TheAnonMessage, was reportedly suspended by Twitter, but other accounts   such as @TheAnonMessage2 and @OpFerguson   also associated with Anonymous distanced themselves and said they had nothing to do with the release of the incorrect name; they continue to tweet news and commentary about the case. Anonymous is decentralized and has said it has no leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stepmother of the man who was incorrectly blamed says shecs scared. cAnonymous has really gotten out of hand,c she said, according to USA Today .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of Brown has sparked protests, some violent, in Ferguson over the past week. Witnesses have said the 18-year-old was unarmed when he was shot by Wilson. The protests have spread online: St. Louis County websites and email systems were reportedly knocked offline, and Anonymous released the address of St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wecve written that Anonymous has targeted corporations, government agencies and more as part of various protests. The hackers have also taken action over police shootings elsewhere, according to the Washington Post .</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison supports a Congressional Black Caucus letter urging the Justice Department to conduct a complete, stand-alone investigation of the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ellison, D-Minn., went on Twitter to call for a &quot;full, transparent investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown,&quot; adding that his &quot;thoughts and prayers are with his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder signed by Ellison and the caucus states: &quot;Press reports suggest that Mr. Brown's shooting may be symptomatic of larger racial tensions in Ferguson. We ask the department to dedicate sufficient resources to investigate the legal and civil rights ramifications of the shooting and surrounding circumstances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said that Brown, 18, attempted to take an officer's gun, but at least one witness said the teen was shot without cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their letter, Ellison and caucus members noted that &quot;First, the St. Louis County Police Department may not be the most objective or credible body to investigate civil rights matters involving law enforcement, given evidence of racial profiling in the past year. Second, only the federal government has the resources, the experience, and the independence to give this case the close scrutiny that the citizens of Ferguson and the greater St. Louis area deserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder said Thursday that members of the Justice Department's Community Relations Service team, who work to mediate race disputes, are on their way to Missouri.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protesters have been gathering every night since last Saturday, when 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead in the mostly black suburb of St Louis during what the authorities said was a struggle over a gun in a police car.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri state police will take charge of security in the town of Ferguson, the state governor said Thursday, after local officers shot dead an unarmed teenager, triggering four days of violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lately it looks like a war zone and that is not acceptable,&quot; Governor Jay Nixon said of -Ferguson, outside St Louis, where county police have been criticised for their military-style crackdown on protests in which another teen was left critically injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will all need to join hands to rebuild the trust that's been lost and help this community regain its stability,&quot; Nixon said, appointing a local African-American officer, Captain Ron Johnson, to take charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, an 18-year-old African-American who was due to start college two days -later, was shot dead by county police on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses and police have given conflicting versions of how the fatal shot was fired, and -anger over the killing triggered angry protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local officers responded by donning military-style combat uniforms, arming themselves with assault rifles, tear gas and rubber bullets, and sending armoured vehicles to crush dissent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reaction was criticised as heavy-handed and over-militarised by critics from across the political spectrum - from civil rights leaders to Republican -Senator Rand Paul to President Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon reacted today by standing down the St Louis County police who had led the crackdown, and drafting in the Missouri Highway Patrol, which answers to the state government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said police would show respect to the citizens as they try to restore calm and &quot;break this cycle of violence&quot;.Despite pleas from protesters, control of the investigation into the police shooting of Brown will remain in the hands of the St Louis County force.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police faced a wave of criticism yesterday after using smoke bombs and tear gas to subdue protesters during a fourth night of unrest in a St Louis suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America awoke to images resembling a war zone on its streets as police officers in military-style uniforms clashed with demonstrators in Ferguson, where protests erupted after an unarmed black teenager was shot dead by a white policeman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Michael Brown was killed on Saturday, the mostly black Midwest suburb has endured one night of violent rioting and three successive nights where police have fired plastic bullets, tear gas and smoke bombs at crowds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday night's trouble started with an event in a local park intended to celebrate the life of the 18-year-old youth, who had just graduated from high school and had been due to start college this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after dark, police in riot gear and backed by armoured trucks broke up demonstrations as rocks and petrol bombs were thrown at their lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two journalists were handcuffed and arrested in a branch of McDonald's and, separately, a black St Louis councillor who has been praised for documenting the events of the week on social media, spent the night in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police ordered Alderman Antonio French out of his car and charged him with unlawful assembly. Speaking as he emerged from the police station yesterday, Mr French told the media: &quot;Our civil rights don't expire at 9pm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama broke off from his holiday in Martha's Vineyard to urge &quot;peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson&quot;. He said there was never an excuse for violence against police or for using events as a cover for looting, but made clear that officers had a duty to allow peaceful protest and not use excessive force. &quot;We all need to hold ourselves to a higher standard here,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama has ordered the Department of Justice and the FBI to run separate investigations into what happened when the student was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri's Governor Jay Nixon said that state Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, who is black, would take over security in a move aimed at ensuring &quot;that we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alderman French described how the latest night of violence unfolded as about 200 protesters gathered near the scene of a convenience store which was burnt out by looters. He said: &quot;The protest was as normal, it seemed peaceful, there was a lot of people out there, but just around nine o'clock, all of a sudden the officers got on the bull horn [loud hailer]. They said, 'This is no longer a peaceful assembly' and that everybody should leave or return to their cars. They said it about two or three more times then they said 'This is your final warning' . &quot;They started to move in. As they started, that agitated the crowd. A lot of young men started cursing again at the officers and then the police released smoke bombs and the people scattered and ran. When they realised it was just smoke, not tear gas, some of them started to come back. The police started to move forward with their assault vehicles and their riot gear and then tear gas started coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday senior politicians began to protest at the way police were responding. &quot;This is America, not a war zone,&quot; tweeted Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat senator. Claire McCaskill, the Missouri state senator, said: &quot;This kind of response by the police is becoming the problem instead of the solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Senator Rand Paul said: &quot;Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half a century on, inequality still runs deep Analysis David Taylor Smoke bombs and military-style policing in Ferguson this week have vividly illustrated how, even in the age of Obama, 50 years after the Civil Rights Act passed into law, the battle for equality in the US goes on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In big cities across the country, one black child in six is taught in an &quot;apartheid school&quot;, where 99 per cent of pupils are nonwhite. They have poorer facilities, and young black men are twice as likely as white pupils to leave school with no qualifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disparity continues in unemployment rates and pay, but is most pronounced in the Justice system. There are almost one million black men in US Jails, and black youths aged 18 and 19 are nearly ten times more likely to be in prison than whites of the same age. On present trends, rights groups say, one in three black males born today can expect to spend time in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes have swollen the prison population, with black people convicted at a higher rate. And while black men make up only 6 per cent of the population, they account for 43 per cent of murder victims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON: A white police officer shoots dead an unarmed black teenager in an American suburb. Accounts vary as to whether the black kid posed any serious threat to the officer. One thing is certain though; he was unarmed and he was shot multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests erupt in the suburb of Ferguson outside St Louis, Missouri, where the incident occurred on August 9, even as police withhold name of the officer citing death threats to him and his family. Anonymous hackers disclose name of the officer on social media and threaten to publish his photograph if the St. Louis County Police Department does not address their concerns. Anger courses through black communities across the nation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson is about 70 per cent white and 30 per cent black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter is serious enough that President Obama consults with his aides, Attorney General Eric Holder and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett - both African Americans - and issues a statement calling for calm and restraint over the unfortunate death of Michael Brown, the black kid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone hopes the matter will go away, except the affected community in the United States, a country with the highest documented incarceration rate in the world - worse that any totalitarian state or dictatorship. At 743 adults in prison per 100,000 population, it is home to 25 per cent of the world's prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By some accounts, blacks form 40 per cent of the country's prison population. There are 3,042 black male prisoners per 100,000 black males in the country, compared to 487 white male prisoners per 100,000 white males. The likelihood of black males going to prison in their lifetime is 28% compared to 4% of white males. If a Black male drops out of high school, he has an over 50% chance of being incarcerated in his lifetime, as compared to an 11% chance for White male high school dropouts. Nearly half of all death row prisoners are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Riot police clear demonstrators from a street in Ferguson.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These numbers, with minor variations, have been bandied about for years. But no fixes are in sight as Michael Brown becomes yet another signpost, and eventually as statistic, in the relentless underlying racial tensions that erupt periodically in the &quot;greatest democracy on earth,&quot; just like social tensions that plague the largest democracy on earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was different from the racially-profiled black youth who constitute majority of the incarcerated population. He had recently graduated from high school and was days away from starting college. He had no criminal record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for reasons yet unknown and unexplained, he got into a confrontation with a police officer, during which, the police say, he assaulted an officer still sitting inside the patrol car and tried to snatch his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's friend who was walking with him says the confrontation began when the office told them to &quot;Get the F88k on the sidewalk&quot; as he drove past them in a police cruiser. He says the officer then backed up to them, grabbed Brown by the neck and shot him while he was still inside the car. According to some witnesses, he then emerged from car, and shot Brown in the back and brought him down even as the young man raised his hands and said screamed he was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, hundreds of students in Washington DC's mostly-black Howard University reprised that pose of Michael Brown, raising their arms in surrender for a photograph that quickly went viral on social media. Meanwhile, the St Louis police did themselves no favor by teargasing protestors and arresting reporters working on the story.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scene harkened to familiar images of battles in Iraq: men in black helmets and body armor sitting on top of armored personnel carriers, rifles at the ready, and surveying the civilian population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except this was in middle America, and the civilian population was made up of  people demonstrating with their hands up to protest the police shooting of an unarmed black teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day after St. Louis County police clashed with protesters in Ferguson, Mo., throwing tear gas canisters, shooting them with rubber bullets and using long-range acoustic weapons that are loud alarms meant to cause ear-splitting pain, a national debate has ignited, questioning the  militarization of local police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis County Police Department, which has been patrolling Ferguson during the unrest that following the shooting of Michael Brown, has been criticized for heavy-handed tactics that include intimidating peaceful protesters and journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,&quot; U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri state officials are now taking a different tack. Gov. Jay Nixon promised Thursday a &quot;different tone&quot; and an &quot;operational shift&quot; by police, and he appointed the State Highway Patrol to take over supervision of security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said earlier Thursday that  &quot;it is my understanding that the county police will be taken off the investigation&quot; into the fatal shooting Saturday of Brown, 18, by a Ferguson police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police response needs to be demilitarized,&quot; she said. &quot;I think the police response has be come part of the problem as opposed to ... part of the solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor of the city of St. Louis, Francis Slay, told USA TODAY the situation was mishandled. &quot;It creates a higher level of anxiety and higher level of anger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of St. Louis is  the largest municipality in the region, but it operates separately with its own government and police force from neighboring St. Louis County, where Ferguson is located. The city has no authority over the police department in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anxiety was evident among Ferguson residents, where in recent days, members of the St. Louis County Police SWAT unit patrolled the town dressed in fatigues, carrying automatic assault rifles and driving  in tanks. The effect was a city turned war zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At varying instances, the officers faced hundreds of angry protestors, some of whom  destroyed parts of the city. At barricades set up by police officers near a convenience store, officers pointed rifles at cars that came too close. Officers also screamed for reporters to duck behind their cars or risk being shot in the crossfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday night, the sounds of flash bomb grenades and the stench of tear gas filled the streets and captured the attention of a riveted nationSt. Louis County Police then arrived with four armored trucks. Some 100 officers in masks and fatigues yelled at protestors to leave. A long line of authorities formed and  addressed the crowd as if they had been rioting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We won't tolerate non-peaceful actions,&quot; an officer on a loud speaker yelled, later telling protestors to put down their rocks and weapons. The problem: No one had weapons nor had they thrown any rocks at the Ferguson police in several hours. People who had been singing  and playing drums now angrily yelled back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Smith, who lives  near the center of the protests, told the governor on Thursday that her neighborhood was under  siege. &quot;Every night we're tormented. The police have no respect at all for the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Chuck Canterbury, president of the national Fraternal Order of Police, a union that represents more than 325,000 officers nationwide, defended the actions of the Ferguson and St. Louis County police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says that he has spoken with officers there and that they have been responding to the violence, not starting it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly two times a week in the United States, a white police officer killed a black person during a seven-year period ending in 2012, according to the most recent accounts of justifiable homicide reported to the FBI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On average, there were 96 such incidents among at least 400 police killings each year that were reported to the FBI by local police. The numbers appear to show that the shooting of a black teenager in Ferguson, Mo., last Saturday was not an isolated event in  American policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports show that 18% of the blacks killed during those six years were under age 21, compared to 8.7% of whites. The victim in Ferguson was 18-year-old Michael Brown. Police have yet to identify the officer who shot him; witnesses have said the officer was white. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the racial analysis is striking, the database it's based on has been long considered flawed and largely incomplete. The killings are self-reported by law enforcement  and not all police departments participate so the database undercounts the actual number of deaths. Plus, the numbers are not audited after they are submitted to the FBI and the statistics on &quot;justifiable&quot; homicides have conflicted with independent measures of fatalities at the hands of police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 750 agencies contribute to the database, a fraction of the 17,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of South Carolina criminologist Geoff Alpert, who has long studied police use of deadly force, said the FBI's limited database underscores a gaping hole in the nation's understanding of how often local police take a life on America's streets -- and under what circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no national database for this type of information, and that is so crazy,&quot; he said. &quot;We've been trying for years, but nobody wanted to fund it and the (police) departments didn't want it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Association of Chiefs of Police, the nation's largest group of police officials, has maintained that police use of force is rare. Citing data gathered by the Bureau of Justices Statistics in 2008, the IACP said less than 2% of the 40 million people who had contact with police reported the use of force or threatened use of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In large part, the public perception of police use of force is framed and influenced by the media depictions which present unrealistic and often outlandish representations of law enforcement,&quot; IACP said in a 2012 report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Nebraska criminologist Samuel Walker, who has conducted extensive research on police force issues, called the lack of a national repository tracking such incidents a &quot;major failure&quot; of the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't mean that all incidents have escaped scrutiny. In addition to federal and state prosecutions of individual officers, seven U.S. police departments have been the subject of reviews by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division in the wake of fatal police shootings since 2010, according to Justice records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albuquerque and New Orleans represented the most egregious  cases during that time, while separate reviews have involved Puerto Rico, Portland, Miami, Seattle and Newark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, street protests erupted in Albuquerque following the police shooting death of James Boyd, a homeless man who had a history of violent outbursts and mental instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month later, the Justice Department issued a scathing review of the police department, concluding that of 20 fatal shootings resulting in death between 2009 and 2012, a &quot;majority ... were unconstitutional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll be the first one to say that they put their life on the line every day, but they're killing innocent people and kids,&quot; said Christal Kennerson, whose nephew was shot and killed by an Albuquerque police officer in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her nephew, Daniel Tillison, 31, was unarmed at the time. Police said the officer was responding to a report of someone selling stolen stereo parts. An investigation by local prosecutors found that when the officer approached him, Tillison put his car in gear and tried to drive away, colliding with the patrol car. The officer, Martin Smith, said he saw Tillison holding a black object; fearing that it was a gun, he shot Tillison once, killing him. Prosecutors concluded that the shooting was justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Austin police officer shot Billie Mercer's unarmed son in the back of the neck last year. The oldest of his three children, now 13, still asks when he'll be able to see his father again, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I already feel like I have a hole in my heart, and to see my grandkids missing him like that,&quot; she said. That detective &quot;doesn't know what he did to our family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mercer's son, Larry Jackson, was killed after he tried to enter an Austin bank robbed earlier that day. A detective, Charles Kleinert, tried to question him, but Jackson fled. Kleinert pursued him under a bridge, where he shot Jackson in the back of the neck. A grand jury indicted Kleinert for manslaughter. It charged that Kleinert was trying to strike Jackson while holding his gun, &quot;recklessly&quot; causing his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the work of the Civil Rights Division, which is largely focused on individual agencies, Walker said a national repository of police deadly force cases is needed to  define the scope of the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People should be able to log into a database and identify where their own department stand on this,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom of the press is under siege in Ferguson, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two reporters, one from The Washington Post and one from The Huffington Post, told of being roughed up and apprehended briefly for nothing more than literally recharging their batteries at a McDonald's. They weren't at a crime scene. They weren't in the way. They identified themselves as reporters. But police ordered them out of the McDonald's, and when they didn't move quickly enough for the officers' taste, they were arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not all. Police fired tear gas at journalists from the cable news channel Al Jazeera.  Al Jazeera said its staffers were easily identifiable as working journalists, and that police continued to fire even after they shouted &quot;press.&quot; After the journalists fled, officers took down their television lights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A photojournalist with St. Louis television station KSDK, filming an altercation in which the police were involved, had his camera hit by a &quot;bean bag round&quot; fired from a rifle. KSDK journalists say they were never told to leave the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, has been gripped by tension since an 18-year-old African American named Michael Brown was fatally shot on Saturday afternoon. Protests have engulfed the majority black suburb, and police have responded in a very aggressive fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's vitally important that Americans receive as richly detailed a picture as possible of what is happening in this fraught situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To do that, they need journalists on the scene to chronicle the events. But the journalists can't do their jobs if they are harassed and obstructed by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make no  mistake, this isn't just a problem for journalists. The First Amendment is a critical element of American democracy. The American people suffer when it is trampled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To their credit, journalists are fighting back. Mike Cavender, president of the Radio Television Digital News Association, wrote a letter to Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson decrying the treatment of The Washington Post's Wesley Lowery and The Huffington Post's Ryan Reilly. He said such treatment of journalists was &quot;unconscionable and must be stopped immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The journalistic community is demanding that you, other command officials and all law enforcement officers involved in this continuing situation respect the rights of reporters and other journalists to provide news coverage in Ferguson so long as they operate legally -- which these two reporters were doing,&quot; Cavender wrote. &quot;Harassment and abuse of anyone in a similar situation cannot be accepted and must not be tolerated by you and others charged with maintaining the peace and security in Ferguson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said National Press Club President Myron Belkind, &quot;In the United States, it is not acceptable to prevent reporters from doing their jobs, let alone to knock them around and throw them in jail and then release them as if nothing happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Jazeera  said in a statement that it was &quot;stunned by this egregious assault on freedom of the press that was clearly intended to have a chilling effect on our ability to cover this important story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding some silliness to a quite serious situation, MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, co-host of Morning Joe, said Lowery and Reilly should have done what police told them to do and that the journalists simply &quot;want to get on TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lowery, who wasn't convinced, told CNN's Kate Bolduan, &quot;I would invite Joe Scarborough to come down to Ferguson and get out of 30 Rock where he's sitting and sipping his Starbucks smugly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Pg. 6A</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">567 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly a week after Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, was shot dead by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., the circumstances remain as murky as the nearby Mississippi River during a flood. Police and a Brown friend tell radically different stories about whether the shooting was justified or something closer to homicide. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's too early for conclusions about the shooting. But the behavior of the Ferguson police department is another matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its heavy handed, unprofessional tactics since the shooting raise grave doubts about both its competence and its credibility. It certainly cannot be trusted to investigate itself or, for that matter, to protect the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have enraged the public they serve by showing little respect for constitutional rights and little recognition of how Brown's killing has tapped into a deep vein of distrust of law enforcement among African Americans. By refusing to disclose basic information, including the name of the officer who shot Brown and autopsy results that could shed light on the case, they've needlessly raised suspicion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, the officer and his family need protection, but a police department is fully capable of achieving that goal without resorting to stonewalling tactics that demolish public trust.  After all, police and prosecutors routinely disclose names of arrested suspects, and in New York City, no stranger to this kind of controversy, it took only two days for police to make public the name of the officer who allegedly killed a black suspect in July by putting him in an illegal chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ferguson police just appear clueless about race relations, for reasons with a familiar historical ring. Thirty years ago, the community was overwhelmingly white. Today, it is two-thirds black, but blacks still hold virtually no political power. The police force's 53-person roster includes just three African Americans. Black residents say they are frequently harassed, and their anger has fueled  unrest -- including looting and demonstrators throwing Molotov cocktails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no excuse for that behavior. The vandals should be prosecuted. But neither does there seem to be any need for authorities to clear the streets with tear gas and rubber bullets, or to muster heavily armed SWAT teams with automatic weapons and armored trucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pictures from Ferguson make the police look more like an occupying force fighting jihadis in Iraq than law enforcement keeping order in their own community. They seem intent on acting with impunity and blocking scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers roughed up two reporters Wednesday, and video also shows police lobbing a tear gas grenade at a TV news crew. Once the crew fled, police in gas masks began taking down the lights and video camera -- until they realized another crew was taping them. They've managed to cast themselves as a cross between Bull Connor, the iconic racist police chief of the segregation era, and the Keystone Cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adult supervision began arriving Thursday. President Obama and Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon called for calm. They noted the rights of protesters and reporters. Nixon put the Missouri Highway Patrol in charge of security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said he had asked the Justice Department and the FBI to conduct independent investigations of what happened to Michael Brown. That's reassuring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the police would help themselves with more transparency and less militarization. <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office of the Governor, The State of Missouri has issued the following press release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Jay Nixon tonight spoke to a community meeting of civic and faith leaders at Christ the King United Church of Christ in North St. Louis County. Below are his prepared remarks: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good evening. I appreciate having the opportunity to speak with you tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, I'd like to recognize Reverend Blackmon and the many faith and civic leaders with us, all of whom have been doing a lot of hard work, without much sleep, leading this community during a very difficult time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just had an opportunity to meet with Amy, Mikal and Rev. Carlton Lee, who you will hear from later tonight.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like them and like all of you, I've done a lot of praying over the past few days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a father of two sons, I've prayed for the parents and loved ones of Michael Brown. I've prayed for the residents and businesses and children of this community. I've prayed for justice. For wisdom. And for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We stand together tonight, reeling from what feels like an old wound that has been torn open afresh. A wound that hadn't quite healed right in the first place, and now the pain is just as searing as when the injury first occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its aftermath, the shooting death of Michael Brown left a family in mourning... a community in crisis... and an entire nation looking for answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, as we grieve for what Michael's family and this community has lost... the charge is ours to make sense of the senseless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This tragedy is a challenge to all of us, not only to the citizens of Ferguson - but to all Missourians - to join hands and begin a journey of reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To have patience for the investigation that is now underway, but be unwavering in our insistence that it be open, thorough and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To keep the peace, while remaining uncompromising in our expectation that justice must not simply be pursued, but achieved. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To express the anger and frustration that we rightfully feel in a way that respects the living, and honors the memory of the young man we mourn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of crisis, we must show calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of burning bridges in anger, we must build them with love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when these traumatic events threaten to open a chasm of distrust, we must fill it with understanding and compassion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember what the Lord tells Zechariah in the Old Testament: 'Administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another....In your hearts do not think evil of each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This community has lost a precious life... but we will not lose hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will find the answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will heal our wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will not succumb to darkness and fear, but rather take courage, and walk the long, hard road toward the light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll do it for Michael Brown and his family, for the citizens of this community, and for all Missourians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we must do it together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you again and God Bless. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American Civil Liberties Union has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside of the Ferguson Police Department, protesters continue to exercise their right to protest in response to the police shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, on Saturday. In a show of solidarity, they hold up signs encouraging drivers to honk their horns in support of justice for the young man's family, just a day away from starting college. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Tony Rothert, legal director of the ACLU of Missouri, and I went down to meet with demonstrators exercising their First Amendment rights across the street from the police department. We handed out &quot;Know Your Rights&quot; cards to inform participants of their rights and protections when interacting with law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the course of that meeting, Mr. Rothert informed the participants that suppressing their right to peacefully assemble is unconstitutional. &quot;Intimidating people to give up their First Amendment rights is no better than prohibiting their First Amendment rights in the first place,&quot; he said. &quot;So, the militarization is very troubling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Brown's shooting on Saturday, Ferguson and St. Louis County police have reacted to the largely peaceful protests in an overtly militarized and confrontational way: body armor, armored cars, SWAT teams, tear gas, snipers training their assault rifles on protestors, and K-9 units. Particularly at night, it's hard to tell the difference between the intersections along West Florissant Avenue and Tahrir Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to a comment that Ferguson police are intimidating members of the media, Mr. Rothert stated that, &quot;If there are journalists who feel they are being shut out and if the media are intimidated or pushed out, then the story doesn't get told. That's an offense to the First Amendment as well.&quot; Since then, disturbing reports of police teargasing and assaulting and detaining journalists have gone viral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked what the ACLU's involvement was, Mr. Rothert informed the participants that a public records request was made to obtain the police reports connected to Michael Brown's death. He told them that our request was denied. &quot;The lack of transparency is troubling,&quot; said Mr. Rothert. &quot;The incident report is a public record that should be disclosed. It sends a bad message when police are asking people to obey the law and they are violating it by not releasing these public documents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No police action was taken during our visit, and there did not appear to be any police officers or representatives near the protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We left around 4:55 p.m. All was quiet. Unfortunately, it didn't remain so as night fell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACLU of Missouri is currently on the ground in Ferguson, Mo., observing police conduct and educating protestors of their rights. You have the constitutional right to not only protest peacefully in public, but you also have the right to record police officers as they carry out their duties to serve and protect you, the citizen. For more on how police forces have become so excessively militarized, please see the ACLU report, &quot;War Come Home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Get Involved <BR>Our communities are not warzones <BR>Act Now <BR>Sign our petition asking the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Justice to stop funneling billions into the militarization of state and local police forces.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American Civil Liberties Union has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting in meetings in the United Nation's ornate Wilson Palace by the shores of Lake Geneva in the shadow of the Alps seems an odd place to discuss racial discrimination in the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the problems of racial discrimination quickly hit home at an event earlier this week that hosted the parents of Travon Martin and Jordan Davis, two unarmed young black men killed by armed white men claiming to be acting in self-defense. Made all the more powerful as it came on the heels of the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., their affecting and often harrowing testimony immediately erased the distance between Switzerland and the United States. It made the discrimination present and underscored the importance of the work being done here at the U.N.'s review of the U.S. record of racial discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event hosted by the U.S. Human Rights Network came just before the start of the U.N. review of U.S. compliance with the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), which was ratified by the United States in 1994. Jordan's father and Trayvon's mother described their loss, unimaginable to any parent, with grace and a fierce determination to make sense of senseless acts. Recounting their families' memory of and love for their slain relatives, both parents expressed frustration and bewilderment over the failure of their sons' assailants and much of society to recognize the value of their sons' lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This theme of the devaluation of the lives of people of color ran throughout the comments of all of the speakers. They described their own and others' experiences, of immigrant child agricultural laborers working without the protections offered children in every other type of employment; black and brown women incarcerated for lengthy periods pursuant to unfair drug laws; black girls prescribed powerful and harmful psychotropic drugs based on behavioral expectations shaped by racial and gender stereotypes; families of color subjected to predatory, toxic mortgages; foreign workers subjected to virtual slavery by a severely flawed American guest worker program that invites labor trafficking and other abuses; and unarmed children shot after arguments about the volume of radios or for being perceived as a threat simply while walking down the street. Each instance described how people of color are denied their right to enjoy childhood, even their very right to life itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil and human rights are rooted in a belief in the fundamental value of every individual regardless of race or ethnicity. The advocates in Geneva appear before the United Nations in frustration and hope - frustration at the failure of the U.S. government to sufficiently assure the rights of all of its residents, and hope that pressure from the CERD Committee can assure American treaty compliance and affirm the fundamental value of all individuals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First Amendment Coalition has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police arrested two reporters, later released, from the Huffington Post and The Washington Post after a confrontation in McDonalds during the protest over the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed young black man in Ferguson, Kansas. The reporters were recharging cell phones and accessing WiFi and prompted the arrests by video recording the police during their questioning. Reporters are frustrated by the failure of the police to provide details of the young man's shooting including how many times Brown was shot. (Talking New Media, August 14, 2014, by D.B. Hebbard) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, August 14, 2014, condemned the arrests in a press release, &quot;The right to record and report on police activities in a First Amendment right - and one essential to the journalist's role as a watchdog and guardian of public accountability for law enforcement and other public officials. That it should be so disregarded, particularly after the journalists identified themselves as members of the press, is almost unthinkable - yet it happened, and happened quite violently according to news reports.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement from The Huffington Post about the arrest of their reporter, Ryan Grim wrote, &quot;Police militarization has been among the most consequential and unnoticed developments of our time, and it is now beginning to affect press freedom.&quot; Grim noted that the reporters were assaulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trevor Timm of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, August 14, 2014, referred to Grim's statement in describing how local police around the country bulked up with the aid of Homeland Security and emboldened by their fire power are sometimes using excessive force on peaceful protesters and reporters on the scene.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POTUS, Senators Respond To Situation In Ferguson. The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown has sparked outrage in his Missouri hometown, across the nation, and worldwide. In the wake of contention between local law enforcement and protesters, President Obama said &quot;now is the time of healing, now is the time for peace on the streets of Ferguson,&quot; at a press conference in Martha's Vineyard. According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) received a standing ovation when &quot;she told the crowd the county should 'demilitarize the police response' in Ferguson.&quot; Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) also called for the demilitarization of the police force in an op-ed for Time. In it, Senator Paul wrote that &quot;there is a systemic problem with today's law enforcement.&quot; [NPR] </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Common Dreams has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It feels like there's been a military occupation lifted off of the area,&quot; Patricia Bynes, Democratic Committeewoman of Ferguson Township, told Democracy Now! Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such was the change in atmosphere in Ferguson, Missouri, where daily protests since the police shooting on Saturday of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown had been met with tear gas, rubber bullets and tanks, bringing widespread criticism to the nation's increasingly militarized police departments and evoking images of civil rights battles of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's gone on here over the last few days is not what Missouri is about. It's not what Ferguson is about,&quot; Gov. Jay Nixon said. &quot;This is a place where people work, go to school, raise their families, go to church. But lately it's looked a little bit more like a war zone and that's unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon said Thursday that the security responsibilities for Ferguson would be transferred to the Missouri State Highway Patrol and led by Capt. Ron Johnson, a native of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson, who is black, announced that his team would be using &quot;a different approach,&quot; and said that police would respect &quot;the anger and fear&quot; that has gripped Ferguson's residents. State troopers walked with demonstrators on Thursday night, when no riot police of tear gas were present, and some of the protestors warmly greeted Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing in front of demonstrators, Johnson held up a photo of Brown and told CNN, &quot;This is why we're here.&quot; Watch the video below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the police power transfer, the Guardian reported, &quot;a carnival-like demonstration filled the center of the city.&quot; The new atmosphere was described by the Associated Press as &quot;almost jubilant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is totally different. Now we're being treated with respect,&quot; 41-year-old Pedro Smith, 41, who has been taking part in the protests, told AP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis alderman Antonio French, who was arrested during the demonstration on Wednesday, praised the change, telling CNN, &quot;Really, it has been the police presence, the heavy-handed presence, which has escalated the situation, and I think led to the violence each night. And so it's good to see this new approach,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, suspects that Nixon's announcement was sparked not by the militarized police response against the protesters but the arrests of two journalists covering the protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The treatment that the media received ... was what many of the protesters have received the last four days,&quot; the St. Louis Post-Dispatch quotes Nasheed as saying. &quot;Only when the media get attacked in a negative manner by the police officers, only then does the governor come out and speak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In various cities across the nation, solidarity protests were held. In Baltimore and New York City on Thursday, chants of &quot;Whose streets? Our streets!&quot; rang out from the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Ferguson revealed Friday that the officer who shot Michael Brown is Darren Wilson.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Ferguson, Missouri on Wednesday arrested reporters and activists, launched tear gas at protesters, and used armored tanks and helicopters to force media out as residents continued to demand answers about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot to death by an officer last weekend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis alderman Antonio French, who had helped organize demonstrations and provide live updates on Twitter, was arrested for &quot;unlawful assembly&quot; after police forced him out of his car and told him he &quot;didn't listen,&quot; according to French's wife, Jasenka Benac French.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two reporters, Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of Huffington Post, were also taken into custody in a foreboding encounter recorded on Lowery's cell phone. An officer can be seen demanding that Lowery stop filming and refusing to answer questions. In a blog post about his experience, Lowery writes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Multiple officers grabbed me. I tried to turn my back to them to assist them in arresting me. I dropped the things from my hands. &quot;My hands are behind my back,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm not resisting. I'm not resisting.&quot; At which point one officer said: &quot;You're resisting. Stop resisting.&quot; That was when I was most afraid -- more afraid than of the tear gas and rubber bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photos and videos from Wednesday night show chaotic scenes as protesters run from police firing rubber bullets through thick clouds of smoke from tear gas canisters. Police also fired tear gas directly at an Al Jazeera camera crew, who had set up equipment to film the protests; after they ran to escape the fumes, officers broke down their cameras.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office of the Senator Claire McCaskill, U.S Government has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the shooting of teenager Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Mo. police officer, and subsequent clashes between local police and protestors, U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill is in Ferguson today, talking directly with constituents. She released the following statement: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to de-militarize this situation--this kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution. I obviously respect law enforcement's work to provide public safety, but my constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests, and the police need to respect that right and protect that right. Today is going to be a new start, we can and need to do better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCaskill is also scheduled to speak directly today with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. While the U.S. Attorney General has no jurisdiction over local police actions, McCaskill plans to discuss with Holder what she described as the &quot;totally unacceptable&quot; situation on the ground in Ferguson as local police and protestors continue to clash, as well as the status of the federal civil rights investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early Wednesday, McCaskill spoke directly with Molly Moran, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice on the status of a federal civil rights investigation. McCaskill has also spoken directly over the past two days with dozens of local officials, law enforcement, and religious leaders, in an ongoing attempt to deescalate the situation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office of the Governor, The State of Missouri has issued the following press release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Jay Nixon today announced that the Missouri State Highway Patrol would immediately begin directing supervision of security responsibilities in the city of Ferguson. The Governor said those efforts would be under the supervision of Troop C Commander Capt. Ron Johnson, who grew up in north St. Louis County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Governor made the announcement at the University of Missouri - St. Louis in north St. Louis County, where he was joined by Capt. Johnson and by St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley, St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay, and area legislators. Earlier today he participated in a meeting of the Clergy Coalition and also went to some of the sites in Ferguson that have been hit by civil unrest since the shooting of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer on Saturday, including the site of the shooting. Gov. Nixon also spoke directly with President Obama today about the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I deeply appreciated the opportunity to speak with - and hear from - members of the neighborhood that is directly affected by the events of the last six days,&quot; Gov. Nixon said. &quot;They told me they want a community that's healthy, happy and safe. They want their streets to be free from intimidation and fear. They told me they want peace. They want truth. They want to be treated with respect. Today, my message to the people of Ferguson is that those voices have been heard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the day, through our words and deeds, that we set the better cornerstone on which to build our shared future,&quot; the Governor said. &quot;Because I know that Ferguson will not be defined as the community that was torn apart by violence, but will be known as the community that pulled together to overcome it. Today is the day that we renew our commitment to bring peace to the families of Ferguson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday morning, Gov. Nixon publicly requested that the federal Department of Justice conduct a comprehensive independent investigation into the shooting. The Governor also spoke on Tuesday night at a community forum held at a church in north St. Louis County, and has been in close contact with community leaders throughout the week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hatred of and violence toward minorities by some white law enforcement officials is still rife in 21st-century America, and it is no small wonder that black men fear and loathe white police officers. Even if Michael Brown provoked the officer, whose race has not been identified, by verbally abusing or striking him, there was no excuse for the use of deadly force against an unarmed person. The FBI will surely sort out what happened in Ferguson, Mo., and I trust the officer will be appropriately disciplined. No matter the outcome, nothing will bring Michael Brown back, and Ferguson now becomes the focal point for the future of race relations across the United States. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown has rightly provoked widespread outrage, drawing international media attention and prompting a comment from President Obama. The same should be true - but tragically is not - of the killing of 3-year-old Knijah Amore Bibb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was killed Saturday in Ferguson, Mo.; Knijah died the following day in Landover, Md. Both victims were African American. Both had their whole lives before them. The salient difference is that Brown was shot to death by a white police officer, according to witnesses, while the fugitive suspect in Bibb's killing is a 25-year-old black man with a long criminal record. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to be clear: From what we know so far, the anger over Brown's death is understandable and appears justified. Absent a full narrative from the police officer's side, we are left with witness accounts alleging that the fatal encounter was triggered when Brown committed the unpardonable crime of &quot;walking while black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've been through this so many times. Brown, from all reports, was a good kid who had just graduated from high school and was about to enroll in college. But young black men are automatically assumed to be dangerous thugs - and are not given the benefit of the doubt that young white men are accorded. This is racist and wrong, and it must change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we should be just as outraged over Knijah's death - and just as determined that this kind of killing should never happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police, Knijah's family was visiting friends at a house in Landover on Sunday afternoon. Among the people who lived at the address was a young woman whose boyfriend, Davon Antwan Wallace, had also dropped by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wallace got into a heated argument with the girlfriend's teenage brother, police and family members told The Post. At issue was clothing that belonged to Wallace - and that the brother had apparently been wearing. Wallace allegedly left, went to his car, got a gun and fired about six shots at the second floor of the house, apparently aiming for the brother's room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those bullets struck Knijah and killed her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She liked to wear silver boots in the summer,&quot; Knijah's grandmother, Brenda Bibb, told The Post. &quot;She had a Hello Kitty sticker on one boot and a Dora [the Explorer] on the other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entire Prince George's County police force - not just the homicide division - has been working long hours to try to find Wallace and is motivated by what a police spokesman called a &quot;sense of moral outrage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That feeling should be universal. The near-constant background noise of black-on-black violence is too often ignored. Yet it continues to claim victims at a rate that our society should consider outrageous and unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landover is adjacent to Washington, where it has been a particularly bloody week: At least 21 people have been struck by gunfire since last Friday. Among them were an off-duty D.C. police detective who was shot in an attempted carjacking. Most of the victims fortunately do not have life-threatening injuries, but at least one was reported to be in grave condition, and one has died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've written about the sad customs that have developed in neighborhoods plagued by this senseless violence - the makeshift memorials of teddy bears and balloons, the speed with which T-shirts bearing a victim's likeness are produced. This kind of death should never be thought of as ordinary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phrase &quot;black-on-black violence&quot; is more often used to distort rather than clarify. Crime depends largely on proximity and thus reflects patterns of racial segregation; the overwhelming majority of white murder victims are killed by whites, just as the overwhelming majority of black victims are killed by blacks. By the standards of most other developed countries, &quot;white-on-white violence&quot; in the United States is also of crisis proportions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is disingenuous to pretend that a shocking disparity does not exist. According to FBI statistics, in 2012, the last year for which figures are available, 2,614 whites were killed by white offenders and 2,412 blacks were killed by black offenders - similar numbers. But the non-Hispanic white population is almost five times as large as the African American population, meaning the homicide rate in black communities is staggeringly higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treating every young black man as a criminal - as may have happened to Michael Brown - is not the solution. We can understand the socioeconomic causes of violent crime without surrendering to them. We need to get angry - before we have to mourn the next Knijah Bibb.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama on Thursday stepped into the racially charged conflict in Ferguson, Mo., making his first extended public statement on the shooting of an unarmed teenager - an incident that has quickly evolved into a national debate over justice in African American communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who is on vacation in Martha's Vineyard, interrupted a day of personal activities with an impromptu appearance before reporters at an elementary school. He sought to strike a balance between calming tensions and promising a thorough investigation into the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now is the time for healing,&quot; said Obama, dressed in a navy blazer and checkered dress shirt without a tie. &quot;Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson. Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's remarks came as his administration faced mounting pressure from civil rights leaders to help restore public trust in Ferguson, amid images of police in military-style riot gear clashing with residents in street clothes. In the five days since Brown was shot dead by a police officer Saturday, Obama and his advisers have attempted to calibrate a response to the fast-moving but still murky set of events. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the nation's first African American president, circumstances have presented additional complexities because most of Ferguson's law enforcement authorities are white and most protesters are black. Obama, at times, has spoken on a deeply personal level about his own feelings on race, but he also has been criticized by black leaders for not speaking out quickly or forcefully enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and his aides are also mindful of the stark contrast between his posh vacation setting on the island and the gritty scenes in Ferguson. New reports late Wednesday evening of police firing tear gas at protesters and arresting two reporters came as Obama dined on &quot;surf and turf and pasta&quot; while mingling with Bill and Hillary Clinton at the birthday party of a mutual friend, according to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president, briefed by senior aides late Wednesday night, believed that &quot;his voice could help quell the violent reaction,&quot; said a high-ranking administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation. When Obama first learned of Brown's death, he felt &quot;a very deep sense of loss&quot; on a &quot;very personal level from one parent to another,&quot; the aide said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as he addressed the situation in Ferguson, however, Obama steered clear of directly addressing the racial tensions, instead emphasizing the &quot;heartbreaking and tragic circumstances&quot; of Brown's death and the need for legal equity. He chided those in the community who exploited the subsequent peaceful protests to engage in looting, and he reprimanded law enforcement officers who used excessive force in their response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's remember that we're all part of one American family,&quot; the president said. &quot;We are united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some high-profile African American supporters said Obama didn't go far enough. In his statement after the not-guilty verdict for George Zimmerman - accused of shooting unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012 - Obama talked about the pain among many African Americans, who looked at that case &quot;through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthea Butler, a religion and black studies professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said of Obama's remarks on Ferguson - which came after he provided an update on U.S. military operations in Iraq - that &quot;people expected a lot more, and they weren't impressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that the president &quot;didn't address the issue. Part of it is that this is really painful and we have seen him step out in painful events and have a lot of compassion. This is a particular pain that comes from racism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's words instead echoed his administration's response earlier in the week, when Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced that the Justice Department would assist investigators in undertaking a &quot;fulsome review&quot; of Brown's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the president, the issue of race has long presented an opportunity and a risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Zimmerman case, Obama made brief remarks within weeks of the shooting, saying that if he had a son, he would &quot;look like Trayvon.&quot; But the president held off on a deeper discussion until after the verdict more than a year later, when he held an impromptu news conference and called for an end to racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Based on my experience with the president, he comes to a situation like this and doesn't look at it as a politician. He tends to analyze it as a father,&quot; Joshua DuBois, a former Obama aide who oversaw faith-based and neighborhood partnerships, said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But DuBois added that Obama's instinct is to &quot;speak to issues where he thinks his voice can help achieve a practical result, if he thinks his remarks can bring healing to that family and community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early in his tenure, Obama faced a public backlash when he waded quickly into a dispute in Cambridge, Mass., after Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., who is black, was arrested by a white officer and charged with disorderly conduct. Obama initially said police &quot;acted stupidly&quot; after the charges were dropped, but the president later regretted his words and invited Gates and the officer to the White House for beers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAACP President Cornell William Brooks, who traveled to Ferguson on Monday, said he hoped that Obama's involvement would spark a national dialogue over the persecution and harassment of black residents by police in their own communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's entirely appropriate,&quot; Brooks said, &quot;given that the president has often talked about the fierce urgency of now, as I stand on the street talking to young people with tears running down their faces, asking what is somebody going to do about this - this feels like fierce urgency of now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the White House rolled out a program called My Brother's Keeper aimed at counseling young African American men. The administration has also sought to shorten mandatory sentences for lesser drug offenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Jealous, the former president of the NAACP, recalled Obama's efforts to help win passage of a bill during his time in the Illinois state legislature to require police agencies to record the race of everyone pulled over in a traffic stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For a lot of people who voted for this president, improving the quality of justice for all of us was central to our early and long motivations,&quot; Jealous said. &quot;I think he understands that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one photo, two officers wearing camouflage and thick vests sit atop a vehicle, a gun pointed at a crowd. In another, a group dressed like soldiers advances on a man, guns drawn and faces obscured by gas masks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their response to the protests and civil unrest after the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer last Saturday, local authorities have employed armored vehicles, noise-based crowd-control devices, shotguns, M4 rifles like those used by forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, rubber-coated metal pellets and tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anger of residents at first  revolved largely around a desire for information about the shooting, but that rage is now rivaled by anger over the authorities' show of force since the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What struck me as I watched on TV was that I was looking at sniper rifles being pointed during the day at peaceful protesters,&quot; said David Goldstick, 38, a former Marine who said that images from clashes Wednesday night impelled him to come out and join the demonstration. &quot;The violence seems to be incited almost exclusively by the police - and it's not even police, it's a paramilitary force.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson challenged that characterization Thursday afternoon during a news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not military, it's tactical operations,&quot; he said. &quot;It's SWAT teams.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was satisfied that no one had been seriously injured in a city that he described as a &quot;powder keg.&quot; However, one officer was hit with a brick and broke an ankle, and a second also was hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Jay Nixon (D) promised Thursday to change the tone of the response, announcing that the Missouri Highway Patrol would take over security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the show of force highlights what civil liberties advocates describe as a decades-long militarization of America's police forces and elicits strong responses from some local and federal officials and veterans of recent wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said he was &quot;deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) of  Missouri called on authorities to &quot;demilitarize this situation,&quot; adding in a statement that &quot;this kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) complained in a Time magazine essay that &quot;Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One program often credited as a source of military resources deployed by police department  is the Defense Department's Excess Property Program - also known as the 1033 program - which  gives equipment, including weapons, to law enforcement agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transfers through the program have increased dramatically in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2006, it made 34,708 transfers worth $33 million to law enforcement agencies. Last year, the number grew to 51,779 transfers valued at $420 million, according to data provided by the Defense Logistics Agency, which manages the program. Through April of this year, the agency had made 15,516 transfers of equipment worth $206 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of all the equipment provided to law enforcement agencies through the LESO [1033] program, only 5 percent are weapons,&quot; DLA spokeswoman Michelle McCaskill said. Since the program started nearly two decades ago, it has transferred equipment valued at $5.1 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ferguson Police Department has received a small amount through the program in recent years, including non-tactical items such as field packs, first-aid kits, wool blankets and medical supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Defense Department would not provide a breakdown of tactical items given to the Ferguson police exclusively but said that law enforcement agencies within St. Louis County - which includes Ferguson - have in recent years received a dozen 5.56mm rifles, half a dozen .45-caliber pistols, night-vision goggles and a bomb-disposing robot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 1033 is just one of a set of federal programs that have facilitated the militarization of local law enforcement agencies, said Kara Dansky, senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union's Center for Justice and the lead author of a June report on the issue. Police departments also have access to billions of dollars in funding from the Justice and Homeland Security departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The militarization of policing is actually not a new problem,&quot; Dansky said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police response in Ferguson was so strong that officials in nearby St. Louis wanted nothing to do with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward 18 Alderman Terry Kennedy e-mailed St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson on Wednesday night to ask him to stop providing assistance in Ferguson. Only four traffic officers had been involved, Dotson replied, promising none would offer assistance Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My gut told me what I was seeing were not tactics that I would use in the city, and I would never put officers in situations that I would not do myself,&quot; Dotson told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some war veterans, the response has appeared to be not only heavy-handed but out of step with the most effective ways for both law enforcement and military personnel to respond to demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see the police are standing in line with bulletproof vests and rifles pointed at people's chests,&quot; said Jason Fritz, a former Army officer and an international policing operations analyst. &quot;That's not controlling the crowd, that's intimidating them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scriven King, a 10-year veteran of the Air Force's law enforcement component and a SWAT officer, attributed the initial spasm of violence to a lack of leadership and mismanagement of public perception by the Ferguson Police Department. &quot;The first thing that went wrong was when the police showed up with K-9 units,&quot; King said. &quot;The dogs played on racist imagery. . . . It played the situation up, and [the department] wasn't cognizant of the imagery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King added that, instead of de-escalating the situation on the second day, the police responded with armored vehicles and SWAT officers clad in bulletproof vests and military-grade rifles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local law enforcement has for decades become increasingly militarized, Dansky said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been going on, particularly in poor communities and communities of color, for decades,&quot; she said. &quot;The problem is that it has been underreported and under-documented in those communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trend swelled after the Sept. 11 attacks, as a new stream of Homeland Security assistance to local law enforcement opened to combat terrorism, according to the ACLU report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In it, Dansky and her colleagues reviewed data on more than 800 SWAT team deployments conducted by 20 law enforcement agencies from 2011 to 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 79 percent of the incidents, a team was deployed to search a home, and more than three in five SWAT deployments involved searches for drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The use of a SWAT team to execute a search warrant essentially amounts to the use of paramilitary tactics to conduct domestic criminal investigations in searches of people's homes,&quot; the report's authors wrote.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, it can happen here,&quot; declared the 34-year-old mom watching her son climb a fence, warning him that she does not want another summer of stitches. &quot;Anywhere the police don't treat people right, something like that can happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On front porches across Barry Farm, a public housing complex in Southeast Washington, folks are talking about the shooting of an unarmed teen, followed by days of riots, in Ferguson, Mo. What happened there resonates here, especially among African Americans who have had tense encounters with police officers in the past.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police? We don't know them. They don't know us. We just stay. Out. Of. Their. Way,&quot; said another woman, who, like everyone else I talked with, didn't want her name in the paper if she was going to say what she thinks about the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that shouldn't be the case in D.C., where the police department has changed dramatically over the past 40 years.  The nearly all-white force that a civil rights activist named Marion Barry called an alien &quot;army of occupation&quot; in 1970, just two years after riots ripped the city apart, became a department that mirrors the city's demographics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current police chief, Cathy Lanier, is white and hugely popular across the city. In the past, though, we've had black police chiefs. Six of the seven police district commanders are African American, and the force is 58 percent black in a city that is now 50 percent African American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how could it be that some residents still feel vulnerable and at odds with the department when it looks so much like them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the powder keg that is erupting before the nation's eyes in Missouri, after all, is the product of long-simmering racial tensions. Only two percent of the Ferguson police department is African American,  in a town that is 65 percent black. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That kind of imbalance is the perfect stage for a police force to take on the role of an  occupying army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An academic study dating back to 1968  found that residents of 14 cities consistently had better relationships with police departments  whose makeup reflected the community. A 2008 study compared the District with Chicago, where the majority-white police force was widely mistrusted by African American residents. The District scored higher in every category.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's still plenty of mistrust - the kind that may have led to the gunfire that killed  18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson. Brown died in  a scenario that every black parent in America faces and fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of parents in the District call Ronald Hampton, who gives a little seminar on this subject about twice a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's basically what to do if you're stopped by police,&quot; said Hampton, a former D.C. police officer who retired to a life of activism as executive director of the National Black Police Association after 23 years on the force. &quot;This is a dinner table conversation that takes place in black homes; it doesn't happen in white homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mostly he speaks to local African Americans after someone they know is pulled over, profiled or harassed. It happened to him, not long after he left the department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The officer told me, 'You should've said you were a police officer,'&acirc;[#x20ac][#x2c6]&quot; after Hampton chided him for profiling and for being rude and unkind. &quot;It shouldn't matter that I was a police officer. You just don't treat people like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Hampton was on the force, the percentage of African American officers was even higher than it is now. We first talked back in 2000, when it was about 66 percent black and he was advocating for more leadership roles for black officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has some fiercely held beliefs about how an officer should act on the job - white, black, brown, whatever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I talked to people, got to know them,&quot; he said. That was called building &quot;community capital,&quot; and it paid off. &quot;When I was out there, I didn't hide. I stopped to talk to people. And if they didn't want to talk to me because there was an awful police officer a while back, I told them not to judge me based on that officer,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putting that much trust in people isn't always easy for police officers. There's a memorial wall honoring those killed just doing their jobs. Last year, a D.C. police officer, Scott Williams, was shot in both legs during the attack at the Washington Navy Yard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a lot of judgment to overcome on both sides. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Barry Farm, residents I talked with said police officers wave at kids when they drive past but don't engage with the adults. None of the two dozen people I talked with knew the name of any of the neighborhood cops. Didn't want to know their names, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if they did come up to me, I ain't going to talk to them. Nobody's telling them nothing,&quot; said a 36-year-old mother of two, who said officers once searched her home the day before Christmas, ripping it apart, including gifts she'd wrapped for her older son. &quot;I'm never going to forget that. They didn't find a thing. And ever since then, I don't trust police and my kids will never trust the police.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 41-year-old man sitting outside said that sometimes an officer will stop to talk with him but that he clams up. &quot;I just stay out of their way. Don't want nothing to do with them,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder. He described being pistol-whipped by a police officer when he was a teenager. He was doing nothing but riding his bike between the apartments and the lines of laundry hanging out back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's never easy to move past the sins of our country's history. Especially when some of that history is only hours old and still being played out on Instagram.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That D.C. officer trying to strike up a conversation isn't the cop who hit kids back in 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That kid riding his bike isn't every hooligan who's wreaked havoc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just like Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, Renisha McBride and Eric Gardner. They  weren't what others thought they were either.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, MO.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. - Federal and state officials unveiled a sweeping response Thursday to violent clashes between police and protesters over the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager, with Missouri taking over security operations from local police and authorities agreeing to accept Justice Department help in handling protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking from Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where he is on vacation, President Obama called for national unity following the police shooting Saturday of Michael Brown, 18, in this St. Louis suburb. &quot;Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson,'' Obama said. &quot;Let's remember that we're all part of one American family.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. then announced a series of steps his department is taking, including a meeting held Thursday with civic leaders to calm tensions and an escalating civil rights probe in which federal investigators have already interviewed witnesses to the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In unusually blunt remarks, Holder said that he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about &quot;the deployment of military equipment and vehicles'' on Ferguson's streets and that Missouri officials have accepted federal assistance &quot;to conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as dozens of protesters continued their campaign near the shooting scene for a fifth day on Thursday, state officials followed the federal lead. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) announced that the Missouri State Highway Patrol would take over security operations in Ferguson, led by Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, an African American who grew up in the area. &quot;We are going to have a different approach and have the approach that we're in this together,&quot; Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the heavy riot armor, the SWAT trucks with sniper posts and the gas masks were gone from the streets of  Ferguson Thursday night, and Johnson marched with the crowd, eliciting cheers from the protesters.  Johnson vowed to not blockade the streets, to set up a media staging center, and to ensure that residents' rights to assemble and protest were not infringed upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not afraid to be in this crowd,&quot; Johnson declared to reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's remarks were the most visible step in a rapid coalescence among political and community leaders to tamp down the violence, as images of riot police, tear gas and government intervention provoked a national debate about race and justice that recalled civil rights battles of a half-century ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a sudden burst of interest fueled by photos and video of heavily armed police that swirled on social media, politicians from both sides of the aisle rushed on Thursday - five days after the shooting - to condemn the tactics of the nearly all-white police force in the predominantly African American town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reactions were remarkably similar across the political spectrum. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), for example, called for authorities to &quot;de-militarize this situation,'' while Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), a likely Republican presidential candidate, condemned &quot;the militarization of our law enforcement'' in a Time magazine essay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on the ground in Ferguson, the support from politicians at all levels was met with skepticism, and it was unclear how much effect it would have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eddie Hasan, a St. Louis resident who helped organize a forum Thursday night at a local Baptist church for young people to voice their concerns, called on elected officials to play a greater role in calming tensions. &quot;This forum, this chance for the youth to speak out absolutely should have happened sooner,&quot; he said. &quot;Hopefully it helps us get some resolution to the issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, who has been active in planning recent protests and was tear-gassed Monday, said local and state officials have been woefully absent. &quot;There hasn't been a single white Democrat down here,&quot; Chappelle-Nadal, who represents Ferguson, said on Wednesday before Nixon's visit. &quot;Mark my words, the Republicans might start showing up before they do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underlying the dispute was the continuing lack of clarity about just what happened Saturday night in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a friend who says he witnessed the incident, Brown was walking down a Ferguson street when a police officer in a car ordered him to get on the sidewalk. Brown had his hands in the air to show he was unarmed when the officer shot him multiple times, the friend said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police version is that Brown attacked the officer in his car and tried to grab his gun.  Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said during a news conference on Wednesday that the officer was struck in the face during the encounter. The side of the officer's face was &quot;swollen,&quot; Jackson said, and he was treated at a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal investigators are still trying to sort out the conflicting versions of events but are proceeding cautiously and deferring to state investigators for now, a federal law enforcement official said Thursday. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said the investigation is a high priority for the Justice Department and FBI but it is far too early to determine if any charges will be brought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department's civil rights division, along with the U.S. attorney's office in St. Louis and the local FBI field office, are investigating the shooting to determine if anyone's civil rights were violated. The federal probe is running parallel to the state investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Holder, who met with Obama on Thursday to discuss the case, said: &quot;Our review will take time to conduct, but it will be thorough and fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another source of frustration for residents is that police, who initially promised to identify the officer involved in the shooting, have backtracked because of what they say are threats to his safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of specifics about the shooting, combined with anger over the show of police force, has many protesters vowing to continue their campaign. Dozens of people did so on Thursday near the shooting scene and also outside the Ferguson police station. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the fourth day of demonstrations, the crowds still rivaled the size at comparable points on previous days, with dozens standing around the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store and half a dozen or so on the center divider - with one man laying face down in the street and the others pointing their fingers like guns at him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hands up, don't shoot!&quot; they declared, words that have been the soundtrack of Ferguson's unrest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many residents said that they do not care if elected officials ever show up. &quot;I don't want to see any governors, or any mayors, or even any more cameras,&quot; said Derrick Beavers, 32, a protester who said he knew Brown. &quot;I want justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Massachusetts, Obama  also called on federal officials to ensure &quot;that justice is done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,&quot; the president said,  adding: &quot;There is also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In concluding his remarks, Obama said that while &quot;emotions are raw right now&quot; in the suburb and accounts of the tragedy differ, &quot;Now is the time for healing. Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson. Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done. And I've asked the attorney general and the U.S. attorney on the scene to continue to work with local officials to move that process forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama did not take questions from reporters after his remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Missouri, Nixon said the highway patrol would assume operational control of the law enforcement response to protests but that local officers from Ferguson and the county police would remain involved, as they have been all week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Johnson took the podium, it seemed clear that things had changed, at least rhetorically. &quot;I understand the anger and fear that the citizens of Ferguson are feeling, and our officers will respect both of those,&quot; said Johnson, who has been the head of the highway patrol's troopers in the region since 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson vowed that he would be on the ground himself on Thursday night and said he planned to visit the QuikTrip store that has become ground zero for the protesters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> W hile I was growing up in an overwhelmingly white, resolutely middle-class neighborhood west of St. Louis, the city of Ferguson - about 20 minutes north around Interstate 270, past the airport - was never an intended destination. It was a working-class area that did not figure or matter much in my world. For all I knew, it was a foreign country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In those days, St. Louis was a city segregated by suspicion and class affinity. And sometimes by race. I remember an African American friend of my older brother being denied entry to the pool at my father's golf club. Membership information had been misplaced. Better to come back later.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I asked my wife, who is Korean-born and also from the St. Louis suburbs, how minorities were treated during her youth, she thought a moment and responded: &quot;I was the minority.&quot; She could not recall attending classes with another minority child until late in high school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis, like nearly everywhere else in the United States, has grown more multicultural (though less quickly than many other places). Immigrants to the area have lately come from Bosnia, India and China. But events in Ferguson demonstrate the paradox of American diversity: An increasingly multicultural nation remains deeply divided by race and class. There are many more friendships and marriages between white and minority Americans (about one in 12 marriages are interracial ) - but at the same time racially charged suspicion and anger persists among millions. And a broad perception of our own racial enlightenment and acceptance has created a different form of isolation - a self-satisfaction that obscures or masks deep social divisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of Michael Brown is not primarily a symbol, an example or a wake-up call. It is a specific human tragedy, on a specific street, involving a serious factual dispute. It is the reality that matters most: the deadly struggle over a gun or the murder of a man with his hands in the air. When an unarmed man is killed by a police officer, it is the police who have the burden to demonstrate that it was somehow justified. When protests begin, it is community leaders who have the burden to channel the outrage constructively. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Brown killing, as part of a grim series of similar tragedies, has quickly become symbolic. As usual, the incident confirms people's existing ideological narratives. It shows a racism deeply rooted in U.S. legal structures. Or it demonstrates the opportunism of the media and the grievance industry. It is evidence of structural rot or of anti-police bias. It indicts the militarization of police forces or reveals the well-armed challenges they face. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many people I know who differ on these matters shared the same immediate, emotional reaction: The images of tear gas, rubber bullets and sniper rifles from Ferguson don't look like America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sense, it is a different country. As the United States has grown more diverse and prosperous over the past several decades, the economic and social isolation of some communities has only increased. This is not entirely a function of race. Many in the white working class have also felt segregated from the promise of America. But problems are concentrated among African American males, who have disproportionately low levels of workforce participation, disproportionately high levels of incarceration and little sympathetic attention from the broader society. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not an excuse or even an explanation for any specific incident. It is just a context. African American males are in a long-term, economic and social crisis for which there are many economic and social explanations. But their most likely interactions with public authority are a squad car or a demand for child support. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These actions can't be the only outreach, the main interaction, our society has with young black men. A merely criminal justice response to their problems will ensure future resentment, kindled into anger by future controversies. As a practical matter, it becomes increasingly difficult to enforce order in the absence of opportunity. We often expect too much of police and prisons. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During civil strife, it is necessary to establish public order - against both criminal elements and abusive police power (which undermines order as well). But our most admirable, influential leaders have attempted to do something more: to build a single nation of justice and opportunity. And surrendering this objective for any group of Americans would leave a nation both diverse and divided. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of demonstrators packed a Northwest Washington park Thursday evening to join the nationwide protests of police actions in Ferguson, Mo., in the aftermath of the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd shouted slogans such as &quot;Hands up! Don't shoot!&quot; and &quot;Black Lives Matter!&quot; and they chanted demands for justice and an end to deaths at the hands of police. At times, demonstrators shouted down event organizers with words of anger and demands for more than talk in a park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can we just march?&quot; Rockville filmmaker Jasmine Bryant yelled at event leaders as she urged protesters to move from the vigil at Meridian Hill Park, also known as Malcolm X Park, into the city streets and toward the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a bullhorn to his mouth, organizer Jonathan Lykes responded, &quot;Tonight, can I just mourn for the people we've lost?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Aug. 9, Michael Brown was walking on a street in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson when, according to a friend of his, a police officer ordered the 18-year-old to move to the sidewalk. The friend said Brown was shot repeatedly after raising his hands to show that he was unarmed. Police have said that Brown attacked the officer and reached for his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting has sparked days of clashes between protesters and police, as well as a federal inquiry into the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Lykes tried to get the crowd to engage in small-group discussion about feelings of hurt and potential action plans, Justice Woods, 26, shouted down the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods, of the Brookland neighborhood, told the crowd of the anger that he felt about his friend and fellow Howard University graduate Mya White, who was shot as she protested Brown's death in Ferguson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, Woods said he hoped that the crowd would channel its emotions toward action, as White did. &quot;When you walk away from here, what are you going to do?&quot; Woods asked. &quot;Get angry. And use it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the event ended, hundreds lingered in the park to exchange ideas for action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jasmine Savoy, 22, and teachers Kyle Walcott, 23, and Rennard Westley, 26, wondered whether they should they organize an economic boycott, join a civil rights organization or organize a protest themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No matter which direction he takes, Westley said, he needed time with like-minded people, so he stayed rather than return to his couch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's important to stick around and try to collect your thoughts and try to process it all,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., has produced a rare and surprisingly unified response across the ideological spectrum, with Republicans and Democrats joining to decry the tactics of the city's police force in the face of escalating protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most notably, the reactions reflect a shift away from the usual support and sympathy conservatives typically show for law enforcement in such situations. Although possibly unique to the circumstances of the events in Missouri this week, the changing reaction on the right is clear evidence of a rising and more vocal libertarian wing within the Republican Party. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No better sign of that came Thursday than in an article by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) published on Time's Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off,&quot; he wrote. &quot;But, I wouldn't have expected to be shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his piece, Paul criticized what he called the growing militarization of local police forces. &quot;There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace,&quot; he wrote, &quot;but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul also bluntly pointed to the role that race continues to play in law enforcement. &quot;Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stuart Stevens, a Republican strategist, said, &quot;It's an interesting left-meets-right dynamic, and probably Rand Paul is at the center of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those people alarmed by the militarization of local police, he said, are the same people troubled by the widespread surveillance programs of the National Security Agency or the increasing use of drones as military weapons. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul is a prospective 2016 presidential candidate and the leading proponent of libertarian philosophy among elected officials. In Ferguson, he has found circumstances almost tailor-made to advance his worldview. In doing so, he continues to set himself apart from others in the Republican Party with the hope of expanding the party's coalition and advancing his own political future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this case, he blames the militarization of local police on big government and especially Washington's willingness to provide such materiel to local communities. His comments on race mark another moment in which he is trying to show an openness to the issues affecting African Americans that sets him apart from others in his party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Weaver, a Republican strategist, said in an e-mail: &quot;There is a growing concern across the country - and finally across demographic and ideological lines - of the militarization of local police, the often quick escalation in lieu of law enforcement defusing a situation, and the erosion of guaranteed rights under the Constitution. The growing libertarian wing of our party is pushing, rightfully, in this direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The images of police in riot gear, with armored vehicles and heavy weaponry, firing a tear-gas canister at an Al Jazeera camera crew (and then putting their lights and camera onto the ground after the crew fled in terror) have drawn alarming reactions from the left and the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rough treatment and detainment of two journalists, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post, has added to the public outrage about the Ferguson Police Department's handling of the protests over Brown's killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more traditional conservatives who also might join the presidential race in 2016, the events in Ferguson have been a cause for more careful reactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) said, in part, &quot;I'm very concerned by recent events in Ferguson, including the violence that has gripped that community and the inexplicable jailing of two reporters. As the FBI looks into allegations regarding the police department there, I hope Americans all over the country will voice their opinions through peaceful means and not resort to violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), whose conservatism is far different from Paul's, walked a careful line in his written reaction that was posted on his Facebook page, balancing what he called the tragedy of Brown's death with the challenges local police face. He also spoke of the need to protect civil liberties and the right of reporters to cover the news without being intimidated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pete Wehner, a White House official during George W. Bush's presidency and a frequent commentator from the right, highlighted what has changed within the conservative movement. &quot;Libertarians are reacting as one would anticipate, but there are more libertarian voices within the Republican Party today than in the past,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in noting the restrained reactions of more traditional conservatives, he offered this caution to those suggesting that libertarianism is gaining widespread support with the GOP. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think a number of people who are conservative are somewhat troubled by the images coming out of there,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think that's indicative of a broader trend among conservatives that is less pro-law enforcement. I think it's to the specifics&quot; of what has happened in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevens predicts a growing audience for these views, particularly among younger Americans. &quot;To be younger and more anti-authoritarian is not unusual,&quot; he said. &quot;More younger voters who are conservative are fine with legalization of marijuana and are fine with gay marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strength of the libertarian movement within the Republican Party will be tested more significantly if Paul seeks the presidency in 2016. But at this moment, its advocates are making their voices heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're not the largest force by any means,&quot; Wehner said. &quot;But they're more influential than they have been in the past, and you're seeing some of that in the reactions to what's going on in Ferguson.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arming of US police agencies with military-grade weaponry and tactics can be traced back, at the very least, to the creation of the paramilitary &quot;Special Weapons and Tactics&quot; Unit (SWAT) in 1967. In Overkill: Rise of Paramilitary Policing  journalist Radley Balko notes that what inspired the heavily militarized SWAT team of today was &quot;a specialized force in Delano, California, made up of crowd control officers, riot police, and snipers, assembled to counter the farm worker uprisings led by Cesar Chavez.&quot; Balko writes in August 2013 for The Wall Street Journal that by 1975 from this first experimental SWAT unit grew to &quot;approximately 500 such units. Today, there are thousands. According to surveys conducted by criminologist Peter Kraska of Eastern Kentucky University, just 13 percent of towns between 25,000 and 50,000 people had a SWAT team in 1983. By 2005, the figure was up to 80 percent.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing, published in June 2014 by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), it is reported that federal programs &quot;are arming state and local law enforcement agencies with the weapons and tactics of war with almost no public discussion or oversight.&quot; One such policy is the Department of Defense (DoD) Excess Property Program, or the 1033 Program, which &quot;provides surplus DoD military equipment to state and local civilian law enforcement agencies for use in counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism operations, and to enhance officer safety.&quot; Items provided by the DoD include, but are not limited to, mine-resistant ambush protected armored vehicles, aircrafts, grenade launchers, countless machine guns, magazines, bomb suits, forced entry tools and units of surveillance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the small city of Ferguson, Missouri, an unarmed African American teenager, Michael Brown, was shot multiple times by a police officer on August 9. Witnesses say that the police officer had initiated a confrontation with Brown, and then physically assaulted him, as reported by Margaret Hartmann for New York Magazine:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Brown's friend, Dorin Johnson, says they were walking in the street when the officer pulled up and told them to &quot;get the eff onto the sidewalk.&quot; Johnson says the officer then reached &quot;his arm out the window and grabbed my friend around the neck.&quot; Witness Piaget Crenshaw said he saw the officer chasing Brown. &quot;They shot him and he fell. He put his arms up to let them know that he was compliant and he was unarmed, and they shot him twice more and he fell to the ground and died.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the murder of Michael Brown, protests began to quickly take shape in Ferguson in response, not only at the scene of the crime but in front of the Ferguson Police Department headquarters. The police response to these protesters, many of whom literally had their hands raised above their heads while shouting &quot;don't shoot!&quot;, was alarming - dogs were called, and heavily armed police officers lined up, intimidating the men, women and children of Ferguson. At least one police officer was recorded shouting, &quot;Bring it, all you fucking animals! Bring it!&quot; Extremely troubling was the implementation of a no-fly zone over Ferguson, meant &quot;to stop media from flying over the area to film.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The targeting of Black communities by law enforcement is historic and ubiquitous; it has long colored every aspect of life for even those indirectly impacted by police actions - when systematic racism meets a militarized police force the outcome is continued dehumanization of Black bodies, societal acceptance of black deaths at the hands of the police and a disastrous escalation, oftentimes with public approval, of violent tactics against the Black people and communities of color. Modern US police departments share a colonial history that gives context to police violence of today - recognizing this framework is essential when examining how police brutality has developed historically. From constables in the 1600s who made up a sort of &quot;neighborhood watch,&quot; wherein they would capture slaves and prevent them from organizing for payment, the slave patrols of the early 1700s, the brazen appointment of police officers by way of their political affiliations in the 1880's and stop-and-frisk, adopted from English common law, we learn that not only is violence an inherent part of the institution itself but it is a necessary component which allows for the state to control its citizens, and it has emerged and developed in the most destructive of ways. Police officers are trained to use force and are given the most lethal of weapons in order for them to do so and, according to data presented in the June 2014 report by the ACLU, this violence is overwhelmingly directed towards people of color. &quot;Sixty-one percent of all the people impacted by SWAT raids in drug cases were minorities&quot; and a majority are Black:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[W]hen the data was examined by agency (and with local population taken into consideration), racial disparities in SWAT deployments were extreme. As shown in the table and graph below, in every agency, Blacks were disproportionately more likely to be impacted by a SWAT raid than whites, sometimes substantially so. For example, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Blacks were nearly 24 times more likely to be impacted by a SWAT raid than whites were, and in Huntington, West Virginia, Blacks were 37 times more likely. Further, in Ogden, Utah, Blacks were 40 times more likely to be impacted by a SWAT raid than whites were.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this, the focus on the actions of individual officers, while warranted, should not overwhelm the discourse - the data presented by the ACLU is not only an indictment of police officers alone but of the police institution itself. Police agencies have created an environment which not only employs violence against minorities but encourages violence against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Present-day US law enforcement as an institution has cooperated with a long list of state agencies which are integral components of the larger machinery of government as well as international police forces. The joint training between the United States and Israel is one such example. In May 2010, 50 retired US admirals and generals vigorously argued that Israel is a security asset in a letter to President Obama, that &quot;American police and law enforcement officials have reaped the benefit of close cooperation with Israeli professionals in the areas of domestic counter-terrorism practices and first response to terrorist attacks,&quot; they wrote in part. In 2010, the Anti-Defamation League publicized that it had sponsored 15 senior law enforcement officials - including from the FBI, NYPD and Boston Police - to take part in an intensive &quot;counter-terrorism training mission&quot; in Israel so that they could share &quot;information, strategies and tactics,&quot; then again in 2011 and 2013. This program, which was first established in 2003, has sent over 115 state, federal and local law enforcement executives to Israel. In 2013, members of a US bomb squad from Arizona, including a US deputy, traveled to Israel for training which included &quot;going to a West Bank outpost with the Israeli National Police bomb squad... learning about port inspections as they relate to counter explosives and counter IED operations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the reasons for this training? &quot;To improve techniques and tactics they use along the US-Mexico border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ADL is not the only organization boasting of this militarized US-Israel partnership. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has an entire publication dedicated to this &quot;strategic partnership,&quot; noting that &quot;Israel has worked with multiple American agencies, including the FBI, NYPD, LAPD, and the Washington, D.C. Police Department.&quot; According to the pamphlet not only have the U.S. Capitol Police undergone training in &quot;Israeli counterterrorism techniques&quot; but the partnership between these two colonial entities is far reaching, even beyond the scope of traditional law enforcement, with FEMA and the National Guard &quot;often [traveling] to Israel to participate in Israeli homeland security drills.&quot; The United States is not only learning from the brutality of the Israeli occupation forces but sharing their knowledge with other nations. The Middle Eastern Law Enforcement Training Center, which is co-sponsored by the FBI and the U.A.E. at the Dubai Police Academy, where FBI agents offer special training courses that &quot;[involve] many aspects of law enforcement, including ways to combat white-collar crime, violent crime, forensics and counter-terrorism.&quot; The United States also conducts military exchange programs in places like Egypt where US forces and Egyptian forces take part in joint military exercises, and offers FBI training to Egypt's secret police who &quot;routinely tortured detainees and suppressed political opposition&quot; according to victim testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police institutions, which continue to work and expand under the guise of law while merging with the most prominent characters behind war-making, including the arms industry, lobbyists, and politicians, demand that communities, most often those of color, surrender what little autonomy they have so that they may receive &quot;protection.&quot; That they are ever permitted to collect on this guardianship is of no consequence because these institutions define protection and determine, for everyone, what is a most satisfactory response to any and all actions on the part of the community members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black men and women have long fought, with their blood, for the decentralization and democratization of the police and the right of their communities to determine their future without threat of police brutality - the Black Panther's Ten Point Program, written in 1966, is a clear-cut example. &quot;We Want An Immediate End To Police Brutality And Murder Of Black People,&quot; the program reads in part. &quot;We believe we can end police brutality in our Black community by organizing Black self-defense groups that are dedicated to defending our Black community from racist police oppression and brutality.&quot; An article in the Palm Beach Post, published in 1969, reads &quot;Decentralized Police Sought By Black Panthers&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Six intense Black Panthers have come in out of the West as advance men for a national conference which will drumbeat a simplistic theme - decentralize the police systems of big cities, place the cops under neighborhood control and give each community its own police commissioner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US police forces uphold white supremacy with their racist implementation of violence, where in places like Ogden, Utah, Black people &quot;were 40 times more likely to be impacted by a SWAT raid than whites were,&quot; according to the ACLU. These forces work towards the preservation of capitalism, and the police, as an institution, use elitism, violence and authoritarianism in order to preserve the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decentralization is not only possible but proving to be a necessary process in order to dismantle the structuralized and militarized brutality that communities of color face at the hands of racist paramilitary police forces. The police have proven that they are not accountable to the communities they allegedly &quot;serve and protect,&quot; and so in order to implement restorative justice the institution itself should be dismantled and replaced with an organization that is transparent, represents the diversity of these communities and which, most importantly, is limited in regards to the scope of the organization's power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 14--The turmoil in Ferguson, Missouri provides a textbook example of what officials should not do when police kill an unarmed black teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost a week after Michael Brown was shot, the public still wasn't officially given the name of the officer who pulled the trigger. There was no official account of what happened and why. For days as protests swelled and turned violent, state and local elected officials were conspicuously absent instead of working tirelessly to cool passions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police responded to mounting protests by creating a war zone. The streets were flooded with armored vehicles, officers were clad in body armor and camouflage. High-powered assault weapons were pointed at the protesters and the press. Some were hit with tear gas and stun grenades. Two journalists were arrested while eating and charging cellphones at a McDonald's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This provocative response escalated a confrontation already roiled by race in the St. Louis suburb where two out of three residents are black, but practically all the police officers are white. The events were magnified by social media, including more than 6 million tweets, and by Wednesday the dramatic scenes were being streamed live around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After talking with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon On Thursday, President Barack Obama called for badly needed balance when he said there is never an excuse for looting and violence against police -- or for police to use excessive force against peaceful protesters. Nixon finally seemed to take charge by putting the state highway patrol in charge on the streets. The FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice are doing parallel investigations with local law enforcement. The facts will eventually come out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to win the public trust, and not just in Missouri, officials have to trust the public with information. Racially charged killings can't be dismissed as isolated incidents. There's an intolerable pattern nationally of unarmed black men dying at the hands of police. Fair adjudication of each case is critical. So is finding a way to avoid such senseless deaths.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 14--The firestorm surrounding the death of an unarmed 18-year-old black man by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, resonates deeply with many New Yorkers calling for reforms in the NYPD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police are just out of control -- in Missouri, New York, California. It seems like they just have no accountability to anyone,&quot; said Constance Malcolm of Williamsbridge in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malcolm's son, Ramarley Graham, was shot and killed by a narcotics detective on Feb. 2, 2012 when he was 18. She is hoping that the national outcry over Michael Brown's death will convince the Department of Justice to open an inquiry into her son's killing. On Aug. 20, she and others will deliver 32,000 signatures to the DOJ office in lower Manhattan asking for an investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressman Charles Rangel -- a veteran of the civil rights movement -- issued a statement Thursday thanking President Barack Obama &quot;for making certain that the Department of Justice will conduct a thorough investigation to determine whether there were any violations of civil rights,&quot; in Brown's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, protesters rallied against the shooting death of the teen in Manhattan Thursday night, starting in Union Square and then moving uptown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights as they pertained to police power -- especially in the wake of Eric Garner dying in police custody on Staten Island on July 17 -- were on the minds of many New Yorkers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shad&eacute;e Parker, 25, a Harlem maitenance worker, said she is regularly stopped by cops for inspection of her back pack, which is filled with cleaning supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She echoed many in saying she would like to see officers subjected to more rigorous background checks, more education and more rigorous training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When cops engage in excessive force, communities become cynical and police officers experience more hostility and taunts while on patrol, said Noel Leader, a co-founder of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement. The Brown death is yet another example of &quot;overreacting by police in communities -- especially when they're dealing with African Americans,&quot; he said. Leader said he hoped Brown's death would result in a more vigorous discipline, more prosecutions and convictions of officers who use excessive force. &quot;That is what sends a message,&quot; and leads to improvements, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frankel Fernandez, 27, a porter recently certified as a surgical technologist, wants to see not just more accountability, but training changed to de-emphasize force. &quot;Why shoot to kill?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fernandez, who lives in Inwood, turned on his phone to show a video he recently filmed of a cop kicking a man who was already subdued on an uptown sidewalk. Cops who abuse the badge by abusing people &quot;should be exposed,&quot; and penalized, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All police officers &quot;have to stop protecting and supporting those cops that are doing wrong things,&quot; said Kadiatou Diallo, 55, the mother of Amadou Diallo who was shot 41 times by four cops in the Bronx in 1999 when he pulled out his wallet to show them ID. Diallo, who has a foundation now named in honor of her son, hopes that the Brown case results in a special prosecutor for all police-involved shootings. &quot;The DAs are part of the law enforcement family,&quot; and can't objectively prosecute such cases, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's death also gives new heft to the argument that police officers should sport body-worn cameras, said Michael Malloy, 40, a messenger who lives on the Lower East Side. Something needs to happen, he said, because &quot;the entire country is like a ticking time bomb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father of Ramarley Graham, Franclot Graham, agreed. &quot;I keep telling my friends this is a boiling pot and it's going to boil over,&quot; he said of excessive force used by cops to often fatal results. But, he lamented, &quot;nothing ever happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS -- Police in Ferguson, Mo., fired several rounds of tear gas to disperse protesters late Wednesday, on another night of demonstrations over the fatal shooting last weekend of an unarmed black teen by a police officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clouds of smoke lingered above an area hit with tear gas as the crowd of about 350 protesters scattered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've had enough of being pushed around because of the color of my skin, I'm sick of this police brutality and I'm angry 'cause of what they done to Michael Brown,&quot; said one protester, 18, who would identify himself only as Terrell. &quot;I'm going to keep coming back here night after night until we get justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fifth night of protests came after St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch said that details about the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown would not be released anytime soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are still in the information-gathering part of the investigation,&quot; McCulloch said at a news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged anyone with information to come forward and promised that every piece of evidence would be reviewed, presented to a grand jury and eventually made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no timeline&quot; for that process, he said. &quot;We will do it as expeditiously as possible, but we won't rush through it. ... It's not going to happen in two weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Withholding details from the public during the criminal investigation will help investigators gauge witnesses' credibility, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the grand jury returns an indictment, the evidence will come out over the course of a trial, he said. If there is no indictment, &quot;absolutely everything will immediately be made public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, dozens of demonstrators chanted &quot;Hands up! Don't shoot!&quot; as they walked in a permitted daytime march. Some young men at the back of the group raised their middle fingers as they passed a Ferguson Police Department officer, shouting profanities at him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's family continues to push for authorities to release the name of the officer who shot the student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wednesday that in the aftermath of the Saturday shooting, a rumor circulated misidentifying the officer, prompting death threats. Jackson decided to withhold the name of the officer. The officer was injured in the confrontation with Brown and the &quot;side of his face was swollen,&quot; Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early Wednesday morning, a St. Louis County police officer shot and critically wounded a man who police say pointed a handgun at the officer near the site of the Brown shooting. A woman also was shot during the area's sporadic street demonstrations overnight, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer-involved shooting, which occurred at 1 a.m., happened near the intersection of West Florissant Avenue and Chambers Road, close to the site of protests against police, said police spokesman Brian Schellman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State and national leaders scrambled today to show they are sensitive to the grievances of African-Americans in urban communities like Ferguson near St Louis, which has seen successive nights of tumult and confrontation in the wake of a shooting of a black teenager by a white police officer last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Footage of the chaos on the streets of Ferguson has dominated newscasts, yet attempts to ease tensions have faltered as local police commanders have chosen to deploy overwhelming force to repel protesters and have declined to release the identity of the officer who opened fire on 18-year-old Michael Brown, days before he was to start college. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images we have seen,&quot; President Barack Obama said, reiterating that he had ordered the FBI and the Justice Department to independently investigate the shooting of Mr Brown. The President broke from his holiday on Martha's Vineyard to address the ongoing violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, told a meeting of residents that &quot;you will all see a different tone&quot; in the police response, after announcing unspecified &quot;operational shifts&quot; in law enforcement tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the exact circumstances of the shooting remain in dispute and may not be officially determined for weeks, his death has become the latest symbol of the simmering racial frustration that still infects American society, 50 years after the Civil Rights Act and six years after Mr Obama became the first black president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, told a meeting in Ferguson that she was seeking a &quot;demilitarisation&quot; of the police response to the protests. Armoured vehicles and non-lethal ammunition such as stun grenades have been deployed, turning an American suburb into what has looked like a war zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St Louis County police department, defended the use of tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse crowds on Wednesday night, which also saw the brief detention of two reporters for videotaping the events. They were released without charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In talking to these guys, it is scary,&quot; Mr Schellman said of officers on the front lines of the protest. &quot;They hear gunshots going off, and they don't know where they're coming from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama said there was no excuse for vandalism or unwarranted attacks against the police, but added pointedly that there was &quot;also no excuse for police to use excessive force against citizens&quot; engaged in legitimate protests. He also took direct aim at whoever arrested the two reporters, working for the Washington Post and the website Huffington Post. Police &quot;should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are trying to do their jobs,&quot; he declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Ferguson is the latest flashpoint in America's struggle to overcome a legacy of racial tension going back to slavery, it could just as easily have been somewhere else; Los Angeles, where 24-year-old Ezell Ford, also black, was shot and killed by a police officer on Monday, or perhaps New York, where the death of Eric Garner while in custody, after an officer held him in an illegal chokehold last month, is still fuelling anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grievances still felt by many African-Americans are rooted in the life experiences of many of them, particularly young men, which are also reflected in the sometimes shocking statistics. Statistics just from Ferguson are startling but by no means unique to the town, which, on the edge of downtown St Louis, became majority black after whites fled decades ago to escape rising violence and sinking schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until last weekend, few beyond Ferguson will have known that only three of its 53 police officers are black, even if the community is overwhelmingly more black than white. Or that 483 blacks were arrested in town last year but only 36 whites. Or that blacks, who make up less than two thirds of the driving-age population, account for 86 per cent of all traffic stops by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, similar instances of unequal lives abound. Median income levels for African-Americans remain about two thirds of what they are for whites, and black unemployment is twice as high. These are disparities that are not always ignored, of course. Hence a current campaign to change sentencing rules for narcotics crimes and enable early release for drug offenders, to try to reduce madly elevated rates of incarceration for black males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But progress can be offset by reverse steps. A campaign inside the white half of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, known as St George, to secede from the rest of the city has widely been condemned, for instance, as a barely disguised return to segregation, where whites will get the best schools and blacks will be left out. A Supreme Court ruling last year gutting the 1965 Voting Rights Act has also been deplored as a betrayal of the civil rights movement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama today appealed for &quot;peace and calm&quot; on the streets of a St Louis suburb besieged by violent clashes between police and crowds protesting the shooting death of an unarmed teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,&quot; Mr Obama said in his first in-person remarks about the tense stand-off in the Missouri suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But let's remember that we're all part of one American family, we are united in common values and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama, speaking from the Massachusetts island where he is on a two-week holiday, said there was no excuse for excessive force by police in the aftermath of Saturday's shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had asked the Justice Department and FBI to investigate the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president said he had also spoken with Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, who has faced criticism for not doing more to control the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama defended the Democratic governor, calling him &quot;a good man, a fine governor&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have defended their use of tear gas and smoke bombs to repel protesters, saying they took those actions to disperse a large crowd after some people threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police used tear gas and smoke bombs to repel crowds who threw Molotov cocktails during another violent night on the streets of a St Louis suburb in the wake of the shooting of unarmed 18-year old Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours earlier, the police chief had said race relations were the top priority in the town, where a white police officer fatally shot the black teenager. Authorities have vowed to reach across the racial, economic and generational divide in a community in search of answers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the streets of Ferguson, though, the polite dialogue heard at community forums and news conferences is nowhere to be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, officers from multiple departments in riot gear and in military equipment have clashed nightly with protesters, who chanted: &quot;Hands up, don't shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday saw more tense confrontations and further volleys of tear gas from police - this time paired with smoke bombs in response to flaming projectiles and other objects lobbed from the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters faced heavily armed police who at times trained weapons on them from armoured trucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St Louis Post-Dispatch reported that about 10 people had been arrested, including St Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has been chronicling the protests on social media. Police had said earlier they would not have arrest information until early today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents in Ferguson have complained about what they called a heavy-handed police presence that began with the use of dogs for crowd control soon after Mr Brown's shooting - a tactic that for some invoked the spectre of civil rights protests a half-century ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County police chief Jon Belmar, though, said his officers have responded with &quot;an incredible amount of restraint&quot;, as they've been the targets of rocks, bottles and gunshots, with two dozen patrol vehicles being destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's pretty amazing how impressed I am and inspired by these officers,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a very difficult circumstance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police had also asked earlier that people assemble in &quot;an organised and respectful&quot; manner and disperse before evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer involved in Mr Brown's shooting, citing threats against that officer and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson called improving race relations &quot;the top priority right now&quot; but also said he will not be pressured into publicly identifying the officer - despite, he said, mounting demands from clergy, computer hackers and protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Jackson said he welcomes US Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force's 53 officers are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri governor Jay Nixon asked community members to be patient and calm while the investigation proceeds and urged law enforcement agencies to &quot;keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Jackson said the investigation remains weeks away from completion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Mr Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Mr Brown was shot multiple times. In their initial news conference about the shooting, police did not specify whether Mr Brown was the person who scuffled with the officer in the car and have refused to clarify their account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Mr Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it &quot;ricocheted&quot; back, apparently upsetting the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says Mr Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Mr Johnson and another witness both say Mr Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, officers shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, resident protests turned to riots, marked by looting and the burning of several local stores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, taking to the streets again Monday night, locals were met with tear gas and rubber bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests against police brutality turned contentious early on Monday evening, leading to a standoff between residents and dozens of officers in riot gear just blocks from where Mr Brown was gunned down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the chief of police said on Tuesday that he had reconsidered his decision to release the name of the police officer involved in the fatal shooting of an unarmed African-American teenager and would not do so because of concerns about the officer's safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The value of releasing the name is far outweighed by the risk of harm to the officer and his family,&quot; the police chief, Thomas Jackson, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief's change of heart came amid another day of protests in the St Louis suburbs where Mr Brown was shot several times Saturday by an officer as he and a friend walked from a corner shop to his grandmother's apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances of the shooting remain in dispute. Police say Brown hit the officer and tried to steal his gun; Brown's family and friends deny that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI has opened a civil rights inquiry into the shooting and the case is being investigated by StLouis County police. The results of an autopsy on Mr Brown have not been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests against the local police have at times turned violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police have made more than 40 arrests since Sunday night and fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an attempt to disperse the crowd on Monday night, officers made their way down West Florissant, a main street in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When some residents, chanting, &quot;Don't shoot, my hands are up,&quot; refused to leave, officers began deploying tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police activity only further incited the crowd, with some people lying in the street with their hands in the air, chanting: &quot;Go home, killers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others fled, crying out for water as stinging tear gas bit at their eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As police continued to press forward, they demanded that residents &quot;get out of the street,&quot; &quot;return to your homes&quot; and &quot;go home now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In turn, residents responded: &quot;These are our homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he ran past this reporter, a middle-aged man summed up the terrifying feeling that permeated the now-quiet Ferguson streets: &quot;And this is only day three ...&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST LOUIS: Violence again erupted in St Louis, Missouri, near the site of the police shooting death of an unarmed black teenager, according to local police, despite calls by President Barack Obama and activists for a measured response. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early yesterday a police officer shot and critically wounded a man who drew a gun near the site of protests over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, a St Louis County Police Department officer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police responded about an hour after midnight to reports of four or five men with shotguns and wearing ski masks. They encountered a number of people running, one of whom pulled a gun on an officer, who fired at him. The man was taken to a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after midnight the police fired tear gas into protesters who had confronted a line of officers after a far larger crowd dispersed, St Louis County Police Department spokesman Brian Schellman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incidents followed two nights of violent protests, looting and arrests in Ferguson, the largely black St Louis suburb. Obama promised a full investigation into the teenager's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I urge everyone in Ferguson, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and family of Brown held a peaceful church vigil on Tuesday night, after his father pleaded for an end to the violence. &quot;I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way,&quot; said, Michael Brown sr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Reverend Al Sharpton, a New York-based civil rights leader, called for peaceful protests in the wake of looting and more than 50 arrests since the shooting. Activists were demanding that authorities make public the name of the officer involved. The police said they would do so on Tuesday, but changed the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Brown was shot in a struggle over a gun in a police car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle. A witness has said that Brown was putting his hands up to surrender when he was killed. - Reuters</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, MO. (AP) &amp;GT;&amp;GT; Police used tear gas and smoke bombs to repel crowds who threw Molotov cocktails during another violent night on the streets of a St. Louis suburb in the wake of the shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours earlier, the police chief had said race relations were the top priority in the town, where a white police officer fatally shot the black teen. Authorities have vowed to reach across the racial, economic and generational divide in a community in search of answers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the streets of Ferguson, though, the polite dialogue heard at community forums and news conferences is nowhere to be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, officers from multiple departments in riot gear and in military equipment have clashed nightly with protesters, who chant, &quot;Hands up, don't shoot.&quot; Wednesday saw more tense confrontations and further volleys of tear gas from police   this time paired with smoke bombs in response to flaming projectiles and other objects lobbed from the crowd. Protesters faced heavily armed police who at times trained weapons on them from armored trucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two reporters said they were detained by police for not clearing out quickly enough from a McDonald's where they were working, near the protests but away from the more volatile areas. The two, who work for The Washington Post and The Huffington Post, were released without any charges. Both say they were assaulted but not seriously hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that about 10 people had been arrested, including St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has been chronicling the protests on social media. Police had said earlier they would not have arrest information until early today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House said President Barack Obama   who is on vacation on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard   was briefed late Wednesday on the situation in Ferguson by Attorney General Eric Holder and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents in Ferguson have complained about what they called a heavy-handed police presence that began with the use of dogs for crowd control soon after Brown's shooting   a tactic that for some invoked the specter of civil rights protests a half-century ago. The county police force took over leading both the investigation of Brown's shooting and the subsequent attempts to keep the peace at the smaller city's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County Police Chief Jon Belmar, though, said his officers have responded with &quot;an incredible amount of restraint,&quot; as they've been the targets of rocks, bottles and gunshots, with two dozen patrol vehicles being destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police had also asked earlier that people assemble in &quot;an organized and respectful&quot; manner and disperse before evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer involved in Brown's shooting, citing threats against that officer and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson called improving race relations &quot;the top priority right now&quot; but also said he won't be pressured into publicly identifying the officer   despite, he said, mounting demands from clergy, computer hackers and protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have the right to know, and the family has the right to know who murdered their son,&quot; said Sahari Gutierrez, a 27-year-old Ferguson legal assistant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said he welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force's 53 officers are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon cited the &quot;worsening situation&quot; in Ferguson in saying he would be in the area Thursday. He asked community members to be patient and calm while the investigation proceeds and urged law enforcement agencies to &quot;keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said the investigation remains weeks away from completion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. In their initial news conference about the shooting, police didn't specify whether Brown was the person who scuffled with the officer in the car and have refused to clarify their account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said Wednesday that the officer involved sustained swelling facial injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it &quot;ricocheted&quot; back, apparently upsetting the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the protesters critical of the police response has been state Sen. Maria Chapelle-Nadal, a Democrat from nearby University City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just want to know if I'm going to be gassed again, like I was on Monday night?&quot; she asked Jackson at a press conference. &quot;And I was peaceful. And I'm your state senator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope not,&quot; he replied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US President Barack Obama called the police shooting death of an unarmed black teenager a tragedy on Tuesday and urged a thoughtful response after two nights of violent protests, looting and arrests in the northern St. Louis suburb where the shooting took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He promised a full investigation by the US Justice Department into the case, which has provoked outrage in the largely African-American city of Ferguson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but ... I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and family of 18-year-old Michael Brown held a peaceful church vigil on Tuesday night, and his father pleaded for an end to the violence.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way,&quot; said the elder Brown, who wore a T-shirt showing his son's baby picture. &quot;No violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred protesters appeared to heed the calls for nonviolence late on Tuesday evening, chanting &quot;hands up, don't shoot&quot; and &quot;no justice, no peace&quot; during a tense but ultimately peaceful standoff with police clad in riot gear and flanked by armored vehicles near the site of Brown's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">50 arrested</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters, some of whom waved signs as the group was led in chants by megaphone, had dwindled to a handful before midnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton, a New York-based civil rights leader, called for peaceful protest in the wake of looting and over 50 arrests since the shooting. Sharpton's National Action Network will pay for Brown's funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To become violent in Michael Brown's name is to betray the gentle giant that he was,&quot; Sharpton said of the 198-cm Brown, who had planned to start college this week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Brown was shot in a struggle with a gun in a police car but have not said why Brown was in the car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conflicting accounts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the racially charged case, and St. Louis County also is investigating.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were many, many witnesses who have talked to family members, and they paint a very different picture than police witnesses,&quot; said Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Brown family.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;hands up&quot; gesture has been frequently seen at protests over the shooting. More than 100 protesters in front of the St. Louis County Courthouse in nearby Clayton on Tuesday morning chanted &quot;hands up, don't shoot&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrations on Sunday night turned violent, with looting and property damage. Violence broke out again on Monday night as police officers in riot gear, armed with rifles and accompanied by dogs, tried to secure the area.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The time has come to draw a line in the sand and say 'no more dead kids,' no more police killings and beatings,&quot; the announcement read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday night anti-police marches were a regular occurrence in downtown Oakland two years ago following the eviction of the Occupy Oakland encampments and subsequent battles between police and agitators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the marches were uneventful, but vandals struck again last July following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Florida teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agitators smashed windows of downtown businesses for three consecutive nights following the verdict. One vandal bashed a waiter in the head with a hammer outside a trendy restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police, who were criticized for not being ready to deal with last year's protests, released a statement Thursday that they have increased staffing Friday evening. &quot;The department is prepared to respond in the event that demonstrations and protests become unlawful, threaten public safety, or incite vandalism or property damage,&quot; Officer Johnna Watson wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bar Dogwood, which had its windows smashed last year during the Trayvon Martin protests, will remain open Friday, according to an employee who declined to give his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have any plans to hunker down and fortify,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown, a recent high school graduate, was shot multiple times by a Ferguson police officer Saturday afternoon. Authorities have refused to identify the police officer, and police and witness accounts differ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing has set off several days of protests that grew more violent on Wednesday as several demonstrators tossed Molotov cocktails and other objects at riot police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilwoman Lynette Gibson McElhaney said any vandalism or violence stemming from the Oakland protest would take attention away from the serious issue surrounding fatal police shootings of young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope people in Oakland get that and that we don't become the story by destroying property and endangering lives,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group gathered in Oakland fell silent at 4:20 p.m. for about 10 minutes, many with their heads bowed and clutching a small lit white candle.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Ferguson, Missouri, fired tear gas, stun grenades and smoke bombs to disperse some 350 protesters late Wednesday, the fourth night of racially charged demonstrations after police shot to death an unarmed black teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some demonstrators hurled rocks at police as others scattered, while smoke engulfed the area. A Reuters reporter saw two young men preparing what looked like petrol bombs in a bus-stop shelter, their faces covered by bandanas. Police said protesters had thrown petrol bombs at officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters have gathered every night since Saturday when 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot to death in the mostly black suburb of St. Louis, during what authorities said was a struggle over a gun in a police car. Some witnesses say he was outside the car with his hands up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have deployed camouflage-clad officers in body armor, including one manning a rifle on a tripod atop an armored car, to Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've had enough of being pushed around because of the color of my skin. I'm sick of this police brutality,&quot; said one protester, who gave only his first name, Terrell, 18. &quot;I'm going to keep coming back here night after night until we get justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A St. Louis alderman, Antonio French, was among some 10 people arrested on Wednesday evening, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper reported. About 40 protesters have been arrested since Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National figures from President Barack Obama to civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton have called for a peaceful response to the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who is vacationing on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, was briefed on Wednesday night about events in Ferguson by senior advisor Valerie Jarrett and US Attorney General Eric Holder, the White House said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said in a series of Twitter messages he would visit the area on Thursday, and urged &quot;law enforcement to respect rights of residents (and) press&quot; with the hopes that the &quot;ongoing crisis&quot; does not compound Saturday's &quot;tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Situation in Ferguson does not represent who we are. Must keep the peace, while safeguarding rights of citizens and the press,&quot; Nixon wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have been slow to release information about the shooting, except to say that it followed a struggle between the unnamed officer and Brown and that the officer was treated at a hospital for swelling on the side of his face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One witness who was walking with Brown at the time has said in media interviews that Brown put his hands in the air and was not struggling with the officer. He said the officer fired multiple times into Brown's head and chest. A preliminary autopsy confirmed Brown was shot a number of times, according to media reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness, Dorian Johnson, was expected to meet on Wednesday with prosecutors and investigators, local media reported. His lawyer, Freeman Bosley, a former St. Louis mayor, did not immediately answer requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness, Tiffany Mitchell, told CNN she watched Brown and the officer &quot;tussling through the window,&quot; with the officer pulling the teen in as he struggled to get away, and then a &quot;shot was fired through the window.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The kid he finally gets away and he starts running. As he runs, the police get out of his vehicle and he follows behind him shooting,&quot; Mitchell said, adding that Brown turned around and put his hands in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the cop continued to fire until he just dropped down to the ground and his face just smacks the concrete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RACE RELATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have declined to release the name of the officer involved in the incident, citing concerns for his safety, a decision that has been criticized by demonstrators. The officer has been placed on administrative leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Chief Thomas Jackson told reporters his priority was improving race relations in Ferguson, which has seen a stark demographic shift in recent decades, going from mostly white to mostly black. About two-thirds of the town's 21,000-strong population are black. On a police force of 53, three officers are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an opportunity to fix what's wrong,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local Ferguson-Florissant school district postponed its first day of classes until Monday, cancelling classes for this Thursday and Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the protest swelled on Wednesday night, reporters Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of Huffington Post were briefly arrested at a fast-food restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cloud of tear gas forced Al Jazeera journalists to flee at one point as they prepared for live reporting, with an anchor for the broadcaster Tweeting that police fired the canister at the crew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, police in California were investigating a separate incident of an officer fatally shooting an unarmed 25-year-old black man in Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On social media, groups claiming to be associated with the Anonymous hacker activist group called for nationwide protests and threatened to reveal personal information about Ferguson police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ferguson police said there have been attempts to hack their website and that it was temporarily disrupted, and the cyber-threats prompted the decision not to release the officer's name.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As unrest surrounding a police shooting in Missouri unfolds, here are some questions and answers about what has happened so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What touched off the outcry near St. Louis?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was about to begin college, was shot multiple times and killed Saturday afternoon in a confrontation with a police of icer in Ferguson, Mo., a St. Louis suburb. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do police say happened?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to St. Louis County's police chief, Brown was walking with a friend in the middle of the street when a Ferguson police officer tried to exit his vehicle. Brown pushed the officer back into the police car, then entered the car, and a struggle ensued over the officer's weapon. A shot was fired inside the car. The officer and Brown then exited the vehicle, and the fatal shooting occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do witnesses say happened?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorin Johnson, a friend of Brown's, told a TV station that he and Brown were walking in the street when the police car pulled up. The of icer said to &quot;get the eff onto the sidewalk,&quot; he recounted. Johnson said the of icer reached out of the car window and grabbed Brown around the neck. Another witness, Piaget Crenshaw, said she saw police chase Brown. &quot;He ran for his life,&quot; she said. &quot;They shot him and he fell. He put his arms up to let them know that he was compliant and he was unarmed, and they shot him twice more and he fell to the ground and died.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who is investigating the shooting?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Ferguson police of icer ired the shots, so an outside agency - the St. Louis County Police Department - is investigating. The FBI and Justice Department have launched a parallel investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has happened in Ferguson since Brown's death?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to mourning and memorials for Brown, there have been demonstrations, street clashes and looting. A St. Louis County police oficer shot and critically wounded a man who police say pointed a gun at him early Wednesday, and the same night, a woman was shot in the head by a civilian but was not seriously injured, police said. Monday and Tuesday police used tear gas on protesters and, media outlets reported, rubber bullets. Wednesday, police asked protesters to rally only during daylight hours. Police arrested 32 people Sunday night on suspicion of theft, assault or burglary. Seven were arrested Monday during a daytime protest, 11 to 15 were arrested during protests Monday night and at least nine were arrested Tuesday night, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the protesters saying?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters have said they want the of icer to be identi ied, ired and charged in the killing, and they want the police force to reflect the racial demographics of the largely African-American community. They also have said that they want respect from police and that they don't want to be shot the way Brown was.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief in a Missouri town where a police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager said yesterday he would not publicly identify the officer because of death threats. Civil rights leader Al Sharpton, standing with the parents of 18-year-old Michael Brown, said the secrecy was fuelling mistrust of the police in Ferguson, a predominantly black town of about 21,000 residents where violent protests followed the shooting. Police have released few details, saying only that a scuffle developed and at some point, the officer's gun was fired inside a patrol car. Witnesses have said Brown had his hands raised when the officer approached and fired repeatedly. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second man was shot by police in the early hours of yesterday morning in the Missouri city where an unarmed black teenager was killed at the weekend, sparking widespread protests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said the man was shot in Ferguson by a St Louis County officer after he pointed a handgun at the officer soon after 1am, after fresh demonstrations over the death on Saturday of Michael Brown, 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer was responding to reports of shots being fired and men wearing ski masks carrying shotguns. Reports said the man was in a critical condition in hospital and a gun was recovered at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman was separately being treated in hospital after being shot in the head during a drive-by shooting in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incidents came after a peaceful end to a tense standoff between protesters and police, prompting hopes that a third night of violence might be avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson police refused on Tuesday to release the name of the officer who shot Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While police say that Brown assaulted the officer during a struggle, witnesses said he was shot while trying to run away after being grabbed by the officer when he and a friend would not leave the road and walk on the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer has been placed on paid leave while the shooting is investigated. The FBI is also looking into whether there were civil rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, President Barack Obama described Brown's death as &quot;heartbreaking&quot;. Noting the FBI investigation, he appealed for calm. &quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions but, as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and family of Brown held a church vigil on Tuesday night, after his father pleaded for an end to the violence. Standing with supporters, including Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist, Michael Brown Sr said he wanted justice for his son but wanted it &quot;the right way&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way,&quot; Brown Sr said. The official response to Brown's death has been rejected as insultingly inadequate by many African American residents of Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 people where 67% of the population is black, yet 94% of the police force - and prominent figures in local government, such as the mayor - are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, 18, was shot and killed by a police officer, which has led to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">angry protests and appeals for an end to violence</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrests were 'assault on press freedom' - Washington Post editor <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists across the United States are up in arms about the arrest of two reporters who were covering a demonstration in Ferguson, Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it appears that their release followed a call from a concerned Los Angeles Times journalist, Matt Pearce, to Ferguson's police chief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pearce said on Twitter that when he informed the chief, Thomas Jackson, about the arrests of the Washington Post's Wesley Lowery and Huffington Post's Ryan Reilly, he replied: &quot;Oh god.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reporters were in the city to report on protests that have followed the shooting dead of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, by a police officer on Sunday (10 August).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were writing their copy in a local branch of McDonald's when police in riot gear arrived. The journalists, who were ordered to leave, began to video and take pictures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers demanded that they stop and at one point, as Lowery later tweeted, some &quot;officers slammed me into a fountain soda machine because I was confused about which door they were asking me to walk out of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, asked on Twitter who he feared more, the protesters or the police, Lowery replied: &quot;Easy answer. I'm a black man - the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of the journalists' arrests spread quickly, prompting Pearce to contact Ferguson's police chief. Their release followed soon after, without charges or explanation. They were denied information about the names and badge numbers of the arresting officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Baron, the Washington Post's executive editor, told Poynter in a statement that Lowery &quot;was illegally instructed to stop taking video of officers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described the fact that Lowery was &quot;slammed against a soda machine and then handcuffed&quot; as &quot;wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Huffington Post's Washington bureau chief, Ryan Grim, told Poynter he was &quot;disturbed&quot; by the arrests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This brilliant film sticks closely to the known facts about one unlawful killing in 2009, but is part of a wider, ever relevant story about the treatment of young black men in America <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Fruitvale Station (2013)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Director: Ryan Coogler</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Entertainment grade: A-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">History grade: A-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On New Year's Day 2009, an unarmed African-American man called Oscar Grant III was fatally shot by transport police at Fruitvale station on San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. The shooting was filmed by several bystanders on their mobile phones. The incident sparked protests, some violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Context </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many historical films deal with grand events, like wars or revolutions. Fruitvale Station is a quiet, unassuming story about the shooting of one ordinary man. In context, though, it is part of a significant historical story. It is estimated that one in three black men in the US today will be incarcerated at some point in their lifetimes; a report by one activist organisation has claimed that a black man was killed by police, security guards or self-appointed vigilantes every 28 hours in 2012. Fruitvale Station was released in July 2013 - coincidentally, just as George Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering black teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale Station feels all too relevant again this week. Protests in Ferguson, Missouri have been met with an extraordinary police crackdown after unarmed teenager Michael Brown was fatally shot by police on Saturday. Other cases have also made headlines in the last few days. John Crawford, a father of two, was fatally shot at a supermarket in Ohio by police while holding an air rifle. Ezell Ford was fatally shot by police in Los Angeles; he was unarmed and reportedly suffered from a mental illness. Though Fruitvale Station focuses on just one story, it relates to a much wider narrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reading on mobile? Watch the video for Fruitvale Station</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale Station opens with real cameraphone footage of the events of 1 January 2009, then flashes back to explore the final day in the life of 22-year-old Oscar Grant (played with superb realism by Michael B Jordan, previously seen in The Wire and Friday Night Lights). Though dramatic licence has been used in the reconstruction of these events, the facts are straight. Grant had recently been fired from his supermarket job; he had a girlfriend (played by Melonie Diaz, also excellent) and daughter; his past included selling drugs and spending time in prison. Accusations that the film makes him simplistically heroic are absurd. Grant is shown to be a complicated character, whose thoughtfulness and kindness are balanced by a too quick and sometimes uncontrollable temper (taken out on his mother and his ex-boss) and a tendency to lie (he has cheated on his girlfriend, and pretends he hasn't lost his job).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Invention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is only one scene which might reasonably be said to go a bit far in making Grant sympathetic, in which he comforts a dog after an accident. The scene is fictional. Some viewers have found it too manipulative. It is unlikely to trouble historians, though. While it might make a slight difference to viewers' perceptions of Grant, it's hardly a historical travesty on the level of, say, setting a film in the wrong era with the wrong people (Apocalypto), attributing a major wartime breakthrough to the wrong nation (U-571) or viciously slandering everyone in the 16th century (Anonymous).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film builds towards its crucial final scene at Fruitvale Station. There is a fight on the train, and the BART police arrive. Though the events on the platform were filmed by several people present, the exact details remain controversial - and the film does not use the real names of the police officers involved. One video has been said to show an officer striking one of the detained men, identified by some as Grant; the officer's attorney disputed that analysis. Grant was shot in the back by Officer Johannes Mehserle. Mehserle's defence argued that he mistook his gun for his taser. The jury convicted him of involuntary manslaughter - a lesser charge than the second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter options that the judge had also offered. The film depicts the scene as confusing. Its focus is on the impact on Grant's family and friends, not on what the officers thought or did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale Station is a fair portrait of Oscar Grant's story, and a brilliant portrait of how lack of opportunity, routine incarceration and racism conspire to devalue the lives of young black men in America.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. Police used tear gas and smoke bombs to repel crowds who threw Molotov cocktails during another violent night on the streets of a St. Louis suburb in the wake of the shooting of the unarmed 18-year old Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours earlier, the police chief had said race relations were the top priority in the town, where a white police officer fatally shot the black teen. Authorities have vowed to reach across the racial, economic and generational divide in a community in search of answers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the streets of Ferguson, though, the polite dialogue heard at community forums and news conferences is nowhere to be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, officers from multiple departments in riot gear and in military equipment have clashed nightly with protesters, who chant, &quot;Hands up, don't shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday saw more tense confrontations and further volleys of tear gas from police - this time paired with smoke bombs in response to flaming projectiles and other objects lobbed from the crowd. Protesters faced heavily armed police who at times trained weapons on them from armoured trucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two reporters said they were detained by police for not clearing out quickly enough from a McDonald's where they were working, near the protests but away from the more volatile areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two, who work for The Washington Post and The Huffington Post, were released without charges. Both say they were assaulted but not seriously hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that about 10 people had been arrested, including St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has been chronicling the protests on social media. Police had said earlier they would not have arrest information until early Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents in Ferguson have complained about what they called a heavy-handed police presence that began with the use of dogs for crowd control soon after Brown's shooting - a tactic that for some invoked the spectre of civil rights protests a half-century ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The county police force took over leading both the investigation of Brown's shooting and the subsequent attempts to keep the peace at the smaller city's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County Police Chief Jon Belmar, though, said his officers have responded with &quot;an incredible amount of restraint,&quot; as they've been the targets of rocks, bottles and gunshots, with two dozen patrol vehicles being destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's pretty amazing how impressed I am and inspired by these officers,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a very difficult circumstance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police had also asked earlier that people assemble in &quot;an organized and respectful&quot; manner and disperse before evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer involved in Brown's shooting, citing threats against that officer and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson called improving race relations &quot;the top priority right now&quot; but also said he won't be pressured into publicly identifying the officer - despite, he said, mounting demands from clergy, computer hackers and protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have the right to know, and the family has the right to know who murdered their son,&quot; said Sahari Gutierrez, a 27-year-old Ferguson legal assistant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said he also welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force's 53 officers are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon cited the &quot;worsening situation&quot; in Ferguson in saying he would be in the area Thursday. He asked community members to be patient and calm while the investigation proceeds and urged law enforcement agencies to &quot;keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said the investigation remains weeks away from completion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. In their initial news conference about the shooting, police didn't specify whether Brown was the person who scuffled with the officer in the car and have refused to clarify their account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said Wednesday that the officer involved sustained swelling facial injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it &quot;ricocheted&quot; back, apparently upsetting the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the protesters critical of the police response has been state Sen. Maria Chapelle-Nadal, a Democrat from nearby University City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just want to know if I'm going to be gassed again, like I was on Monday night?&quot; she asked Jackson at a press conference. &quot;And I was peaceful. And I'm your state senator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope not,&quot; he replied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. Police used tear gas and smoke bombs to repel crowds who threw Molotov cocktails during another violent night on the streets of a St. Louis suburb in the wake of the shooting of the unarmed 18-year old Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours earlier, the police chief had said race relations were the top priority in the town, where a white police officer fatally shot the black teen. Authorities have vowed to reach across the racial, economic and generational divide in a community in search of answers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the streets of Ferguson, though, the polite dialogue heard at community forums and news conferences is nowhere to be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, officers from multiple departments in riot gear and in military equipment have clashed nightly with protesters, who chant, &quot;Hands up, don't shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday saw more tense confrontations and further volleys of tear gas from police - this time paired with smoke bombs in response to flaming projectiles and other objects lobbed from the crowd. Protesters faced heavily armed police who at times trained weapons on them from armoured trucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two reporters said they were detained by police for not clearing out quickly enough from a McDonald's where they were working, near the protests but away from the more volatile areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two, who work for The Washington Post and The Huffington Post, were released without charges. Both say they were assaulted but not seriously hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that about 10 people had been arrested, including St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has been chronicling the protests on social media. Police had said earlier they would not have arrest information until early Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents in Ferguson have complained about what they called a heavy-handed police presence that began with the use of dogs for crowd control soon after Brown's shooting - a tactic that for some invoked the spectre of civil rights protests a half-century ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The county police force took over leading both the investigation of Brown's shooting and the subsequent attempts to keep the peace at the smaller city's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County Police Chief Jon Belmar, though, said his officers have responded with &quot;an incredible amount of restraint,&quot; as they've been the targets of rocks, bottles and gunshots, with two dozen patrol vehicles being destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's pretty amazing how impressed I am and inspired by these officers,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a very difficult circumstance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police had also asked earlier that people assemble in &quot;an organized and respectful&quot; manner and disperse before evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer involved in Brown's shooting, citing threats against that officer and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson called improving race relations &quot;the top priority right now&quot; but also said he won't be pressured into publicly identifying the officer - despite, he said, mounting demands from clergy, computer hackers and protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have the right to know, and the family has the right to know who murdered their son,&quot; said Sahari Gutierrez, a 27-year-old Ferguson legal assistant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said he also welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force's 53 officers are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon cited the &quot;worsening situation&quot; in Ferguson in saying he would be in the area Thursday. He asked community members to be patient and calm while the investigation proceeds and urged law enforcement agencies to &quot;keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said the investigation remains weeks away from completion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. In their initial news conference about the shooting, police didn't specify whether Brown was the person who scuffled with the officer in the car and have refused to clarify their account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said Wednesday that the officer involved sustained swelling facial injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it &quot;ricocheted&quot; back, apparently upsetting the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the protesters critical of the police response has been state Sen. Maria Chapelle-Nadal, a Democrat from nearby University City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just want to know if I'm going to be gassed again, like I was on Monday night?&quot; she asked Jackson at a press conference. &quot;And I was peaceful. And I'm your state senator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope not,&quot; he replied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT Barack Obama has called the police shooting death of an unarmed black teenager a tragedy and urged a thoughtful response after two nights of violent protests, looting and arrests in a St Louis suburb. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But early yesterday, a police officer shot and critically wounded a man who drew a handgun near the site of the protests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St Louis County Police Department officers responded to reports of four or five men with shotguns and wearing ski masks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of them pulled a gun on an officer, who fired at him, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, police had again fired tear gas into protesters who had confronted a line of officers after a far larger crowd dispersed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama promised a full investigation by the US Department of Justice into the teenager's death, which has provoked outrage in the largely African-American town of Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and family of 18-year-old Michael Brown held a peaceful church vigil on Tuesday night after his father pleaded for an end to the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing with supporters, including the Reverend Al Sharpton, Michael Brown Sr. said he wanted justice but wanted it &quot;the right way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred protesters appeared to heed the calls for non-violence, chanting &quot;hands up, don't shoot&quot; and &quot;no justice, no peace&quot; during a tense but ultimately peaceful stand-off with police clad in riot gear and flanked by armored vehicles near the site of Mr Brown's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Governor Jay Nixon told a packed church the community was &quot;reeling from what feels like an old wound that has been torn open afresh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate incident simmering in California, a vigil was also planned following Monday's shooting death of an unarmed 24-year-old black man in Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1124 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People in this part of the world believed that the United States' first black president would introduce radical policies, including signing executive orders to put paid to racial issues that affect African-Americans, some of which end tragically like the Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE geo-political sphere has so much to contend with right now, and all the events in the troubled spots are threatening to be tipping points and threats to global peace and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the wars and civil strife, the deadly Ebola virus is proving that it has the capacity to kill more people than all the wars put together - not just in Africa, but even in the most developed countries with state-of-the-art healthcare systems. Since March, more than a thousand people, mostly West Africans, have succumbed to the deadly virus which the World Health Organisation (WHO) has described as a public health risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, this is not about the Ebola virus. It is about United States President Barack Obama and his slow action regarding issues affecting African-Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is about President Obama who refused to invite President Mugabe and three other African leaders to his inaugural US-Africa Summit early this month claiming governance issues and human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But you start wondering which world the US president lives in. When cases of racial profiling, police brutality against African-American men and the killing of unarmed African-American men are in the news most of the time, you wonder who exactly is on the right side of the civil liberties issue: the four African presidents versus President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of writing, there were violent protests by citizens of Ferguson, Missouri, in the United States who are demonstrating against the killing of an &quot;unarmed black teenager&quot;. President Obama called the killing a tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is indeed a &quot;tragedy&quot;, Mr President, and so, too, are the other brutal killings of unarmed black men in the United States in the past. Last time, African-Americans had to demonstrate for close to month before Trayvon Martin's killer could be apprehended. I have also watched a number of videos on TV and YouTube showing US police brutality against African-Americans, and have wondered whether we are back to slavery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what is more tragic Mr President is that the killing of this teenage boy has resulted in more shootings, and that the police officer that shot dead Michael Brown has not been arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is also a tragedy considering that this part of Missouri has a large black population, but where the racial dynamics in the police force do not match the demographics, since black police officers are outnumbered by white police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, President Obama issued a statement, which read in part: &quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but . . . I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr President what does it mean when you ask people to remember Michael Brown &quot;through reflection and understanding&quot;? What should they reflect on, and what is it that they have to understand?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That despite having one of their own in the White House, they should understand that they are still fair game in a country where things are viewed through colour lines - black and white to be specific?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since President Obama has accused our President of all sorts of things and even imposed economic sanctions not only against President Mugabe but the whole nation, the simple question we ask is what is President Obama doing for the black people in the United States of America?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Zimbabweans, we know that you are angry with President Mugabe for redressing the colonial imbalances where a few thousand white people &quot;owned&quot; land including the natural and mineral resources, while the black people, who are the owners of Zimbabwe had nothing. Your disdain is now understandable because it is as if you are not one of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People in this part of the world believed that the United States' first black president would introduce radical policies, including signing executive orders to put paid to racial issues that affect African-Americans, some of which end tragically like the Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown cases. How na&iuml;ve we have been to not realise that it is a straitjacket position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus we should think about your role in a reflective and understanding way, and simply accept that racial profiling and police brutality against African-Americans will not go away any time soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a process. After all, it took centuries of fighting for black people to be recognised, let alone run for office at the highest level - the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US leader should also look at his situation at home and the just-ended US-Africa Summit, through a reader who calls himself &quot;Afrika Comment&quot;: &quot;President Barack Obama had long forgotten his roots only to be awakened by the hard-to-ignore Chinese economic footprints in Africa. At Nelson Mandela's funeral, Obama arrogantly pointed out that Washington did not need Africa's resources, which ironically is what the US hunts and kills for wherever resources are found on the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My President R.G. Mugabe was not invited, and had he been invited, he would have gone to Washington to shame the devil, or he would have refused protesting at Washington's litany of shortcomings and its shameful inhuman human rights record and illegal sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe . . . The leaders that Washington did not invite are deemed to be 'dictators' or its perceived enemies of democracy as if its own record in that aspect is a bed of roses ... The sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe are truly 'targeted'. They have been targeted on every Zimbabwean the way I see it. How can they not? The US-Africa summit becomes a damp squib in the sense that it does not have the capacity to rectify the trail of destruction left by colonialism in a space of only five years, that's not realistic - Obama knew that - but he could tell his visitors that . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On second thought, I also tell myself that President Obama's little action regarding African-American men's (in particular) civil liberties is too tall an order for him to deal with in his eight years in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a mammoth task because he has to deal with the likes of Zimbabwe apart from fighting terror, competing with China and dealing with the so-called Russian aggression against American interests. After all, Obama is president and Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America defence forces. Although he is decisive in his protection of Israel's interests, he cannot replicate that among his African-American brothers and sisters. That would amount to villagising the most powerful man on the planet.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The precise facts surrounding the death of Michael Brown, the unarmed black student shot and killed by a white police officer last Saturday afternoon in a poor suburb of the Midwestern US city of St Louis, are inevitably in dispute. But the broader lessons of the incident, which has sparked three nights of rioting and disorder, are not. The residual poison of racial segregation and discrimination has still not been purged from American society. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only three decades ago, Ferguson, the suburb in question, was overwhelmingly white in population. Today, black people outnumber white people by almost three to one. Yet the local political and law-enforcement structure remains dominated by whites, to the point that of the suburb's 53 police officers, only three are black. Stir in the habit of police (not only in Ferguson but in towns and cities across the US) to stop and arrest black citizens disproportionately, and throw in the pent-up resentment in the black community at this practice, and the events in Ferguson were an explosion waiting to happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, moreover, they are all too familiar. The arrest and beating of the black construction worker Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers in 1991 led ultimately to the California city's worst riots in half a century. Over the years, similar incidents have generated racial tension and anger, most recently the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, by a neighbourhood-watch guard at a gated community in Florida. The name of Michael Brown must now be added to this list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indubitably - and as the election of a black president testifies - the US has made great strides in the past half-century towards achieving racial equality. Less so, however, in the field of policing. The looting and vandalism that occurred in Ferguson are plainly wrong. But as Martin Luther King also observed, &quot;a riot is the language of the unheard&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police spokesman said Wednesday that a man who was fatally shot by two officers in South Los Angeles Monday night during a struggle had attempted to remove a gun from an officer s holster, a preliminary account that conflicts with statements made by the man s family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members told KTLA (Channel 5) on Tuesday that the 25-year-old man, whom they identified as Ezell Ford, was complying with Los Angeles Police Department officers  orders when he was shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said Wednesday that two veteran officers from the Newtown Division, who work gang detail, were driving their patrol car in the area of 65th Street and Broadway when they saw the man walking on a sidewalk, stopped their car and exited to talk to him. As the officers approached and made eye contact with the man, he continued to walk  making several suspicious movements, which include an apparent attempt to conceal his hands,  Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the officers attempted to stop him at some point, the man spun around, grabbed one of the officers and both the man and the officer fell down to the ground, Smith said. There was then a struggle with the  suspect on top of our officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We got two officers, one involved in a fight underneath the suspect   the suspect was on top of him,  Smith said.  It appears the suspect was attempting to pull a gun out of the (officer s)holster. The partner shoots the suspect. (Then) the officer underneath pulls his backup weapon while holding on to his primary weapon and shoots the suspect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all of the Police Department s patrol cars are equipped yet with video cameras and this particular car was not equipped, Smith said. Although a pilot program is underway in the Central Division in which officers are equipped with cameras on their bodies, nothing like that exists in the Newton Division, he said. Both officers were assigned home duty until the chief can make a decision on their status, which is expected to happen today, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tritobia Ford, who identified herself as the man s mother, told KTLA Tuesday that her son was lying on the ground, complying with the officers  commands, when he was shot three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My heart is so heavy,  she said.  My son was a good kid. He didn t deserve to die the way he did. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man who identified himself only as a cousin told the TV station there was no reason for the  excessive force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications,  the man said.  Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division knows that   that this child has mental problems. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earl Ofari Hutchinson of the Los Angeles Urban Roundtable, who along with other civil rights leaders has called for a meeting with Chief Charlie Beck over the matter, said he wants an investigation that is  swift, speedy, fair and impartial and most importantly transparent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Typically, these investigations drag on weeks and weeks and months on months,  Hutchinson said.  We are not interested in that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., a man killed by a police offer s chokehold after allegedly selling black market cigarettes in New York and the beating of Marlene Pinnock by a CHP officer in Los Angeles   in which all the victims were black    there has to be a sense of urgency,  he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A protest organized by those concerned about the shooting is slated for 3 p.m. Sunday at Police Department headquarters at 100 W. First St., according to a Facebook page .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly quoted LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith as saying the partner shot the officer. In fact, he shot the suspect.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting by a police officer of an unarmed black teenager has led to a social media effort draw attention to news media portrayals of young black men. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Tyler Atkins heard about the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, 18, an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Mo., he posted on Twitter a picture of himself in a tuxedo, with a saxophone around his neck, next to a photograph of himself dressed in a black T-shirt with a blue bandanna tied around his head and his finger pointed at the camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like hundreds of young African-Americans, he placed his pictures under the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown, protesting Mr. Brown's killing by a police officer and the way young black men are depicted in the news media. He said that Mr. Brown's identity was distorted and filtered through negative stereotypes, and that the same would have been done to him if he found himself the victim of a similar event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first picture was taken after a jazz concert at the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Houston, where Mr. Atkins, a senior, studies music. The other was taken during a recording for a rap video he made with friends for a school math project. ''Had the media gained ahold of this picture, I feel it would be used to portray that I was in a gang, which is not true at all,'' Mr. Atkins, 17, wrote in an email. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speed with which Mr. Brown's death has resonated on social media has helped propel a local shooting into a national cause. Mr. Brown, 18, was shot several times on Saturday by an officer as he and a friend walked from a convenience store. The circumstances remain in dispute. The police say Mr. Brown hit the officer and tried to steal his gun; Mr. Brown's family and friends deny that. The F.B.I. has opened a civil rights inquiry into the shooting, and the case is being investigated by the St. Louis County Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests since the shooting have sometimes turned violent: Stores have been looted, and at least one business was set on fire. The police have made more than 40 arrests since Sunday and fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. The situation remains so tense that police are refusing to make public the name of the officer involved, citing concerns about possible retribution against him and his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, President Obama issued a statement calling the shooting ''heartbreaking'' and urging Americans to remember Mr. Brown ''through reflection and understanding.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Mr. Brown's death, African-American commenters and others on social media have drawn attention to continued episodes of violence directed at African-Americans, as well as the media portrayals of young black men. The case, they say, fits a pattern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This affects me deeply because the stories of Mike Brown, Renisha McBride, Trayvon Martin, Sean Bell, Amadou Diallo and many more could have been me,'' Mr. Atkins wrote, referring to the shooting deaths of blacks, some at the hands of police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brittney Gault, 28, a student at DePaul University, in Chicago, said the #IfTheyGunnedMeDown campaign gained popularity because of the strength of black Twitter users collectively known as ''Black Twitter.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They are really a media response team,'' Ms. Gault said. ''Everybody is tapped into Black Twitter.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social media chatter and anguish have become part of a complicated sea of viral words and images - a picture Tuesday of police officers in combat gear pointing military-style rifles at a young black man in jeans and a blue T-shirt was one of them - that have created a new and charged environment for social activism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to data from the Pew Research Internet Project, 40 percent of African-Americans ages 18 to 29 use Twitter, compared with 28 percent of whites of the same age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the #IfTheyGunnedMeDown campaign began, the phrase has been used on Twitter more than 168,000 times. Commenters on Twitter are also hoping to organize a series of vigils called the National Moment of Silence, which is meant to commemorate victims like Mr. Brown. The St. Louis County N.A.A.C.P. urged people on Twitter to use the hashtags #MikeBrown and #blacklifematters ''so that your posts can be seen nationally.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local authorities in Ferguson are less enthusiastic about social media's role, blaming it for inciting looting and violence after the events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They have the ability to understand where they're all going to be, and they can basically plan where they want to go next,'' said Jon Belmar, the St. Louis County police chief. ''So it's a really efficient way to communicate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The image of Mr. Brown that spurred the campaign on Twitter showed him with the fingers of his right hand extended in what some considered a peace sign, but which others called a gang sign. A spokeswoman for NBC News, one of the outlets that published the photograph online, said it was taken from Mr. Brown's personal Facebook page, where it was his profile picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a subsequent article about Mr. Brown's killing, the network used a different photograph of him that showed him wearing headphones and gazing at the camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tosan Tutse-Tonwe, 32, a blogger, consultant and co-founder of a nonprofit group called Act 4 Accountability, said photographs remove context from a situation, particularly after negative stereotypes about black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Tutse-Tonwe posted a photograph of himself wearing a T-shirt from his group and another with a black male friend who is flashing peace signs. Mr. Tutse-Tonwe said he chose to post the photograph with his friend after the image of Mr. Brown making the same hand gesture was circulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mike was throwing up a peace sign and people thought it was a gang sign? You've got to be kidding me,'' Mr. Tutse-Tonwe said. ''People make these leaps and there's no basis in them and they go unchecked.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Connally, 24, a student studying computer science at University of Texas at Arlington, agreed. ''They're portrayed as if they deserved it, cop versus robbers, good guys versus bad guys,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Twitter engagement is part of broader efforts to use social media as a tool for education and engagement, particularly among the young. Few things have been more of a spur to passionate campaigns on Twitter and other social media than some of the racially charged killings of young blacks in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Aug. 7, when The Associated Press published a Twitter message announcing that Theodore P. Wafer, a white man from the Detroit area, had been found guilty of second-degree murder for killing Renisha McBride, a 19-year-old black woman, Twitter users reacted swiftly, criticizing the post that described Mr. Wafer as a ''suburban Detroit homeowner'' and Ms. McBride as a ''woman who showed up drunk on porch.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, Twitter users posted African-American history images, including one featuring a slave ship with the headline, ''Families board wrong ship, end up in wrong place.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yemisi Miller-Tonnet, 19, a student at Spelman College, in Atlanta, said social media movements should be taken seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Hashtag activism is activism,'' she said. ''We might be tweeting from a couch, but we're also getting up and doing the work that needs to be done.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence again erupted in the St Louis area near the site of the police shooting death of an unarmed black teenager, according to local police, despite calls by US president Barack Obama and activists for a measured response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early yesterday, a police officer shot and critically wounded a man who drew a handgun near the site of protests over the death of Michael Brown (18), a St Louis county police department officer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police responded about an hour after midnight to reports of four or five men with shotguns and wearing ski masks. They encountered multiple suspects running, one of whom pulled a gun on an officer, who fired at him, the county officer said. The man was taken to a local hospital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incidents followed two nights of violent protests, looting and arrests in Ferguson, the largely black St Louis suburb where the shooting of Mr Brown took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama promised a full investigation by the US department of justice into the teenager's death. &quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but . . . I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and family of Mr Brown held a peaceful church vigil on Tuesday night, after his father pleaded for an end to the violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing with supporters, including the Rev Al Sharpton, Michael Brown snr said he wanted justice for his son but wanted it &quot;the right way&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way,&quot; said Mr Brown snr, who wore a T-shirt showing his son's baby picture. &quot;No violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drive-by shooting Yesterday, a woman was shot in the head in a drive-by shooting blocks from the area where Mr Brown was killed. Her condition and whether the shooting was related to the protests were unknown, a spokesman for the police department said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate incident simmering in California, a vigil was planned after Monday's shooting death of an unarmed 24-year-old black man in Los Angeles, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">USA Today</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cited a Los Angeles police department spokeswoman as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev Sharpton, a New York-based civil rights leader, called for peaceful protest in the wake of looting and more than 50 arrests since the shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To become violent in Michael Brown's name is to betray the gentle giant that he was,&quot; Rev Sharpton said of the 6ft 4in teenager, who had planned to start college this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri governor Jay Nixon told a packed church in north St Louis county on Tuesday evening that the community was &quot;reeling from what feels like an old wound that has been torn open afresh&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activists were demanding that authorities make public the name of the officer involved. The police had said they would do so on Tuesday, but changed the plan, citing fears of retaliation, according to media reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Mr Brown was shot in a struggle with a gun in a police car but have not said why he was in the car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness to the shooting interviewed on local media has said that Mr Brown had been putting his hands up to surrender when he was killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the racially charged case and St Louis county is also investigating. - (Reuters)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 18, Michael Brown had overcome learning difficulties to graduate this month from high school in St Louis, Missouri, and he was about to start at a local technical school, learning how to fix furnaces and air conditioners. But last Saturday afternoon, as he was walking from a convenience store towards his grandmother's apartment, Brown was shot dead by a uniformed police officer. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating exactly what happened but two facts are beyond dispute: Brown was unarmed and he was black. The shooting sparked three nights of violent clashes between police and protesters, some of whom marched with their hands in the air chanting &quot;Don't shoot, my hands are up&quot;, as Brown is reported to have said before he died. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, a black Florida teenager, by a neighbourhood watch volunteer in 2012, Brown's killing has highlighted the risks faced by young African-American men on account of prejudice and fear. It has also brought attention to the specific circumstances of Ferguson, the St Louis suburb where Brown was shot. Long an overwhelmingly white town, &quot;white flight&quot; to other suburbs meant that by 2010 two-thirds of Ferguson's population was black. This change is not reflected in political representation, however, and five out of the town's six city council members are white, there are no African-Americans on the local school board, and just three of Ferguson's 53 police officers are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama has called for &quot;reflection and understanding&quot; following Brown's death. But as African-Americans reflect on their condition, six years after the election of America's first black president, they see that they continue to fall behind in terms of employment, wealth and opportunity. Young black men like Brown are much more likely than their white counterparts to be stopped by police, arrested, charged, convicted and imprisoned. And more likely to be killed by the police who are supposed to protect them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snapping photos of police in Ferguson, Missouri, may have gotten Huffington Post reporter Ryan J. Reilly arrested Wednesday night while he was covering protests prompted by the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager who was shot to death by a police officer.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reilly and Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowrey were detained and assaulted after attempting to film a swarm of police officers inside a McDonald's. An officer slammed Reilly's head into a glass window, and Lowery was shoved into a soda fountain while wearing press credentials around his neck. Both were later released without being charged with breaking any laws. <BR>&quot;They essentially acted as a military force,&quot; said Reilly, who was in the restaurant to charge his phone and computer. &quot;It was incredible.&quot; <BR>In recent years, there have been countless cases of police officers ordering people to turn off their cameras, confiscating phones, and, like Reilly, arresting those who attempt to capture footage of them. Despite a common misconception, it's actually perfectly legal to film police officers on the job. <BR>&quot;There are First Amendment protections for people photographing and recording in public,&quot; Mickey Osterreicher, an attorney with the National Press Photographers Association, told The Huffington Post. According to Osterreicher, as long as you don't get in their way, it's perfectly legal to take photos and videos of police officers everywhere in the United States. <BR>This misconception is pervasive enough that the New York City Police Department circulated a memo last week reminding officers. <BR>&quot;Members of the public are legally allowed to record police interactions,&quot; the memo states, according to the Daily News. &quot;Intentional interference such as blocking or obstructing cameras or ordering the person to cease constitutes censorship and also violates the First Amendment.&quot; <BR>The NYPD's reminder comes as police activity is in the national spotlight. Just two days after Michael Brown's death, cops in Los Angeles shot to death an unarmed black man who allegedly struggled with mental illness. And three weeks ago, a New York City police officer put Eric Garner in an illegal chokehold that left him dead after gasping &quot;I can't breathe!&quot; A bystander caught the entire thing on video. <BR>Those deaths, along with the arrests of Reilly and Lowrey, have raised questions about what, if anything, individuals can do to hold the police accountable for their actions. But one unquestionable right people have is to capture officers on film.  &quot;There's no law anywhere in the United States that prohibits people from recording the police on the street, in a park, or any other place where the public is generally allowed,&quot; Osterreicher said. <BR>So why do so many police officers still act as though that isn't the case? <BR>&quot;Probably because they haven't been trained otherwise,&quot; said Osterreicher. &quot;I think that there are many officers that believe that the minute they tell somebody to do or not do something, that that's an order. But police can only order somebody to do or not do something based on the law, and there is no law that says you can not record or photograph out in public.&quot; <BR> 2014 Legal Monitor Worldwide.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- Protests in the St. Louis suburb rocked by racial unrest since a white police officer shot an unarmed black teenager to death turned violent Wednesday night, with people lobbing Molotov cocktails at police who responded with smoke bombs and tear gas to disperse the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who has been the public face of the city torn by Saturday's death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, told reporters earlier in the day that the St. Louis County investigation of the shooting could take weeks to complete. In the meantime, he said, his department welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force's 53 officers are white. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, an undertow (of racial unrest) has bubbled to the surface,&quot; said Jackson. &quot;Race relations is the top priority right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Jackson said he wanted to mend fences with the community, protesters were on the streets of Ferguson again Wednesday, facing heavily armed police who at time trained weapons on them from an armored truck. Two reporters said they were detained by police while working at a McDonald's in the area. The situation became more tense after nightfall, with police ordering people to go home and then using smoke bombs and later tear gas after some people threw Molotov cocktails and other things at them. Journalists who witnessed the events included an Associated Press photographer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said he had no immediate information about the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post said they were handcuffed and put into a police van after officers came in to quickly clear the fast-food restaurant where they were doing some work. The Post reported Lowery said he was slammed against a soda machine and plastic cuffs were put on his wrists. The reporters were subsequently released without any charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin D. Baron, the Post's executive editor, issued a statement saying &quot;there was absolutely no justification&quot; for Lowery's arrest and said the organization was appalled by the officers' conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson did not immediately return a cellphone message Wednesday night from the AP seeking comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. In their initial news conference about the shooting, police didn't specify whether Brown was the person who scuffled with the officer in the car and have refused to clarify their account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said Wednesday that the officer involved sustained swelling facial injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it &quot;ricocheted&quot; back, apparently upsetting the officer. Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some protesters Wednesday raised their arms above their heads as they faced the police. Others held signs asking for answers about Brown's death. The most popular chant has been, &quot;Hands up! Don't shoot!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's body remained on the street for hours -- a span Jackson deemed &quot;uncomfortable&quot; but justified, given that &quot;you only get one chance at that crime scene&quot; to process it correctly. Jackson said authorities also were concerned about gunfire they could hear in a nearby building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the shooting's aftermath, the notorious hacking collective Anonymous has taken credit for burrowing into the city website and shutting it down for much of the day Monday. The group also released what it said were audio experts from St. Louis County dispatch on the day Brown was killed. Police declined to comment on the recordings Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

(AP) -- The Missouri State Highway Patrol will take over supervising security in the St. Louis suburb that's been the scene of violent protests since a police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager, the governor announced Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Jay Nixon made the announcement that security will be overseen by Capt. Ron Johnson of the Highway Patrol after the local police response drew heavy criticism. Nixon said the change is intended to make sure &quot;that we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit and let some of the energy be felt in this region appropriately.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson, who is black, said he grew up in the community and &quot;it means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,&quot; Nixon said at a news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds have gathered to protest since Saturday's shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. On Sunday night, some residents were seen looting stores, damaging buildings and vandalizing property. Since then, officers from multiple departments in riot gear and in military equipment have clashed nightly with protesters, who chant, &quot;Hands up, don't shoot,&quot; a reference to witness accounts that Brown had his hands raised when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have used tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse large crowds, including on Wednesday night when some people threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon, who has faced increasing criticism over suggestions he has not done enough to calm tensions, said local police will still be involved in providing security, but under state supervision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Thursday, President Barack Obama appealed for &quot;peace and calm&quot; on the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,&quot; Obama said. &quot;But let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, speaking from the Massachusetts island where he's on a two-week vacation, said there was no excuse for excessive force by police in the aftermath of the shooting. He said he had asked the Justice Department and FBI to investigate the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said officers on Wednesday night tossed tear gas to disperse a large crowd of protesters after some threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers. More than 10 people were arrested in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In talking to these guys, it is scary,&quot; Schellman said of officers on the front lines of the protest. &quot;They hear gunshots going off, and they don't know where they're coming from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents in Ferguson have complained about the police response that began soon after Brown's shooting with the use of dogs for crowd control -- a tactic that for some evoked civil-rights protests from a half-century ago. The county police force took over, leading both the investigation of Brown's shooting and the subsequent attempts to keep the peace at the smaller city's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County Police Chief Jon Belmar said his officers have responded with &quot;an incredible amount of restraint&quot; as they've had rocks and bottles thrown at them, been shot at and had two dozen patrol vehicles destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, citing threats against that officer and others. The hacker group Anonymous on Thursday released a name purported to be that of the officer, but the Ferguson police chief said later that the name was incorrect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twitter quickly suspended the Anonymous account that posted the officer's purported identity and personal information. The site's code of conduct strictly forbids the publication of private and confidential information without permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer involved was injured, with one side of his face swollen, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told reporters that the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEHRAN, Aug. 14 (MNA) - A Missouri police has shot the second man in the city where a teenager was already shot dead last weekend; protest and unrest continue there. According to reports, police officials said that the man was shot in Ferguson by a St Louis County officer after pointing a handgun at him soon after 1am on Wednesday, following fresh demonstrations over the death on Saturday of Michael Brown.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman was separately being treated in hospital after being shot in the head during a drive-by shooting in the city. The incidents followed the peaceful end earlier to a tense standoff between protesters and police, prompting hopes of avoiding a third night of violence. A raucous convoy of about 250 young demonstrators, marching along a main route into downtown Ferguson, was halted about 30 yards from a wall of police assembled at the entrance to the street where Brown was killed by a still-unidentified officer on Saturday. Officers in military-style uniforms, some carrying high-powered rifles and wearing balaclavas, formed a line at least two men deep and blocking the entire width of Florrisant Street, the main drag where angry protests over Brown's killing had flared for the previous two nights. Pitched behind two large armoured trucks, they repeatedly warned the demonstrators through a Tannoy system to &quot;get out of the road or face arrest&quot; - the same warning delivered on Monday night before officers fired teargas, rubber bullets and wooden baton rounds into the crowds. But for 40 minutes, the protesters defied the threat. Some hung out of car windows, while others raised their arms aloft and repeated what has become their defining slogan: &quot;Hands up, don't shoot.&quot; A police helicopter swooped around the dark sky above, shining a bright spotlight on the faces of the almost entirely African American crowd. As the police declined to follow through with arrests, furious members of the crowd screamed obscenities at officers and urged them to &quot;shoot those rubber bullets&quot;. In the early hours of Wednesday it was reported that a small skirmish had resulted in police again using teargas and a young woman being struck in the head with a projectile. Spookwrites, an Instagram user who had previously been covering the protests, posted a photograph of herself wearing a neck brace and showing cuts on her face. Ferguson police refused on Tuesday to release the name of the officer who shot Brown in sharply disputed circumstances. While police say that Brown assaulted the officer during a struggle, witnesses said he was shot while trying to run away after being grabbed by the officer when he and a friend would not leave the road and walk on the pavement. The Ferguson city police officer who shot Brown has not been named publicly, but has been placed on paid leave while the shooting is investigated by the separate St Louis county police department. The FBI is also looking into whether the incident caused civil rights violations. The official response to Brown's death has been rejected as insultingly inadequate by many African American residents of Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 people where 67% of the population is black, yet 94% of the police force - and prominent figures in local government, such as the mayor - are white.monstrations over police shooting of Michael Brown, 18 ZK MNA END</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looters targeted more than a dozen businesses in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson overnight on Sunday after a vigil &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; on the sidewalk where Michael Brown died &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; erupted into clashes with police armed with tear gas, clubs and rubber bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time,&quot; Obama said in a statement, his first public reaction to the incident, which has stirred racial tensions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,&quot; Obama added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">@BT New Screen/briefs Text - no indent;Running more than 6.5km a day could be dangerous to your health, according to a study that examined how much exercise is too much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers focused on 2,400 heart attack survivors and found that the more exercise they did, the less risk they faced of dying from heart disease &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot;up to a point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefits began to decline among those who ran more than 48km per week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among walkers, the turning point, when benefits were lost, was seen in those who did more than 75km per week, or 10.5km per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more, there was a statistically significant cardiovascular risk associated with the highest levels of exercise, said the study led by Paul Williams of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Paul Thompson of the Department of Cardiology at Hartford Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers cautioned that since their study focused on heart attack survivors, their &quot;results might not be generalisable to the population at large&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For patients with heart disease, almost all should be exercising, and generally most should be exercising 30-40 minutes most days,&quot; said Carl Lavie, a cardiologist at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show of force by police in&nbsp;Ferguson, Missouri, troubles Mayor Bill de Blasio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. de Blasio said today he didn't know the details about the ongoing unrest in the Missouri town, though he questioned the harsh reaction of police officers there to protests following the shooting death an unarmed 18-year-old man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know the details of what's happened in Missouri. &nbsp;I think it is a different situation in a number of ways but some of the images are certainly troubling,&quot; Mr. de Blasio said. &quot;I don't like to see, you know, journalists under arrest. I don't like to see situations where there's such an intense show of force that may not be entirely necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officers in military gear patrolled an apparently peaceful protest in Ferguson yesterday, eventually arresting journalists from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Washington Post</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Huffington Post</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;who were filing stories from a local McDonald's. The police actions have provoked outrage in Missouri and online, where resentment is festering between the predominately white police force and black residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavily-armed police officers carrying machine guns and driving armored vehicles have tried to disperse protesters calling for justice in the case of Michael Brown. An unidentified officer this month shot and killed Brown, who was black. The exact circumstances surrounding Brown's death are unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. de Blasio used the event to draw a contrast between the Ferguson police and the NYPD, who are again drawing criticism after a Staten Island man died in police custody last month. The mayor praised the NYPD for properly managing protests in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For decades and decades we've had the tradition in this city of respecting and properly managing peaceful protest,&quot; he said. &quot;I give the NYPD a lot of credit, I give the people of this city a lot of credit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can say safely the way we do things here is the right way. There's a tremendous respect for the democratic process while maintaining security,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Los Angeles Police Department said Wednesday that a man fatally shot by officers earlier in the week tried to remove a handgun from an officer holster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials released information about Monday's fatal shooting after local civil rights leaders and activists called for a swift investigation, likening the incident to the recent shooting death of an unarmed teen by police officers in Ferguson, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to LAPD reports, two gang officers from the Newton Division stopped the man about 8:10 p.m. as he walked on a sidewalk near 65th Street and Broadway in South Los Angeles. A struggle ensued when the man grabbed one of the officers and tried to remove the officer's handgun from its holster, prompting both officers to shoot, police said. The officer who was grabbed fired a backup weapon, police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Cmdr. Andrew Smith said the man was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was taken to California Hospital Medical Center, where he died, said Lt. Fred Corral of the L.A. County coroner's office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police would not say why they stopped the man, and they have not released his name, saying only that he was in his mid-20s. Local civil rights leaders and neighbors identified him as Ezell Ford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford's family told KTLA/5 on Monday night that he was mentally disabled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashanti Harrison, a neighbor who said he witnessed the shooting from his second-story bathroom window, told the Register that Ford had put his hands in the air, was tackled to the ground and shot three times while laying down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harrison, 31, said he grew up with Ford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was cool. He did not bother nobody,&quot; Harrison said. &quot;He was kind of slow. The whole neighborhood took care of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbor Keshawn Hardeman, 30, echoed those sentiments, describing Ford as respectful and calm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not a threat. He's good people,&quot; Hardeman said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters Wednesday at the scene of the shooting, Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable President Earl Ofari Hutchinson said the incident echoes a similar shooting of an unarmed man over the weekend in a St. Louis suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have our own Michael Brown,&quot; he said. &quot;We want answers. ... Do you really want to find the truth? That's my challenge to the LAPD.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was shot dead Saturday by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., triggering chaotic protests and exposing deep racial and economic fault lines in the community. The chief of the St. Louis County Police Department, which is hand ling the investigation, has said there was a struggle over the officer's weapon before numerous shots were fired. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds took to social media to blast the LAPD for Monday's shooting, but the neighborhood where it happened was calm. A protest organized on Facebook is planned for 3 p.m. Sunday at LAPD headquarters downtown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with all officer-involved shootings, the inspector general, the Police Commission and the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office are expected to investigate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The LAPD views any loss of human life as a great tragedy,&quot; Assistant Chief Earl Paysinger said in a statement. He encouraged witnesses with evidence, such as video recordings of the shooting, to call police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In part, Paysinger's statement read:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On August 11, 2014 at approximately 8:10 p.m., two uniformed LAPD officers driving in a marked police car and assigned to the Newton Area Gang Enforcement Detail (GED) were driving westbound on 65th Street approaching Broadway when they saw a man walking on an adjacent side walk. The officers stopped the patrol car, exited the vehicle, and attempted to talk to the individual. After looking in the officers' direction, however, the individual continued walking and made suspicious movements, including attempting to conceal his hands. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the officers got closer and attempted to stop the individual, the individual turned, grabbed one of the officers, and a struggle ensued. During the struggle, they fell to the ground and the individual attempted to remove the officer's handgun from its holster. The partner officer then fired his handgun and the officer on the ground fired his backup weapon at the individual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the second officer-involved shooting by Los Angeles police in less than 48 hours. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday night, a narcotics officer wounded a man in a shooting near 30th Avenue and West Ninth Street in Jefferson Park.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Missouri: Violence again erupted in the St Louis area near the site of the police shooting death of an unarmed black teenager, according to local police, despite calls by US President Barack Obama and activists for a measured response. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early yesterday, a police officer shot and critically wounded a man who drew a handgun near the site of protests over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, a St Louis County Police Department officer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police responded about an hour after midnight to reports of four or five men with shotguns and wearing ski masks. They encountered a number of suspects running, one of whom pulled a gun on an officer, who fired at him, the county officer said. The man was taken to an area hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after midnight, police fired tear gas into protesters who had confronted a line of officers after a far larger crowd dispersed, St Louis County Police Department spokesman Brian Schellman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A photograph in the St Louis Post-Dispatch showed a protester wearing a shirt with an American flag printed on it throwing a tear gas container back at the police. There were other media reports of bottles thrown at police. The incidents followed two nights of violent protests, looting and arrests in Ferguson, the largely black St Louis suburb where the shooting of Brown took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama promised a full investigation by the US Department of Justice into the teenager's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but... I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and family of Brown held a church vigil on Tuesday night, after his father urged an end to the violence. Standing with supporters, including the Reverend Al Sharpton, Michael Brown sr said he wanted justice for his son but wanted it &quot;the right way&quot;. - Reuters</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A riot can be many things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be an act of communal madness, reflecting the emotional imbecility of those who believe the best way to express joy at their ball team's win is to overturn a car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be an act of opportunism, a chance, under cover of darkness, influence of chaos, suspension of order, to smash and grab and run away, arms heavy with loot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it can be an act of outcry, a scream of inchoate rage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what happened this week in Ferguson, Missouri. The people screamed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To believe that this carnage -- the windows smashed, the buildings torched, the tear gas wafting -- is all about the killing of Michael Brown is to miss the point. Brown, of course, was the unarmed 18-year-old African-American man shot multiple times by a Ferguson police officer on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar -- Ferguson Police asked his department, as an outside agency, to investigate the shooting -- has said Brown was walking with another individual when a so-far unnamed officer sitting in a police car, stopped him. According to Belmar, the officer was trying to get out of his car when one of the two individuals pushed him back inside, where there was a struggle over the officer's weapon and at least one shot was discharged. He says the officer came out of the car and fired, striking Brown, who was about 35 feet away, multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses say Brown, who was to have started college this week, had his hands up when he was shot. Police have not said why the officer felt the need to stop him in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details are still too sketchy for us to draw hard conclusions about what happened that afternoon. But it is all too easy to understand what happened afterward and why good people should be paying attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because, again, this is not just about Brown. It's about Eric Garner, choked to death in a confrontation with New York City Police. It's about Jordan Davis, shot to death in Jacksonville, Florida, because he played his music too loud. It's about Trayvon Martin, shot to death in Sanford, Florida, because a self-appointed neighborhood guardian judged him a thug. It's about Oscar Grant, shot by a police officer in an Oakland subway station as cellphone cameras watched. It's about Amadou Diallo, executed in that vestibule and Abner Louima, sodomized with that broomstick. It's about Rodney King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is about the bitter sense of siege that lives in African-American men, a sense that it is perpetually open season on us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that too few people outside of African America really notice, much less care. People who look like you are everyday deprived of health, wealth, freedom, opportunity, education, the benefit of the doubt, the presumption of innocence, life itself -- and when you try to say this, even when you document it with academic studies and buttress it with witness testimony, people don't want to hear it, people dismiss you, deny you, lecture you about white victimhood, chastise you for playing a so-called &quot;race card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They choke off avenues of protest, prizing silence over justice, mistaking silence for peace. And never mind that sometimes, silence simmers like water in a closed pot on a high flame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One can never condone a riot. It is a self-defeating act that sells some fleeting illusion of satisfaction at a high cost in property and life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But understanding this does not preclude recognizing that the anger we see in Ferguson did not spring from nowhere, nor arrive, fully-formed, when Michael Brown was shot. It is the anger of people who are, as Fannie Lou Hamer famously said, sick and tired of being sick and tired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silence imposed on pain cannot indefinitely endure. People who are hurting will always, eventually, make themselves heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if they must scream to do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- Demonstrations over the fatal shooting of an unarmed African-American teenager in a St. Louis suburb are slated to spread to Oakland on Friday, putting police and downtown business owners on high alert. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a show of camaraderie with those taking to the streets to protest the recent killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Mo. police officer, anti-police activists in Oakland have called for a march through downtown Oakland Friday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call to action, posted on the Occupy Oakland website, asks supporters to &quot;wear all black&quot; to the protest that is scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. outside City Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The time has come to draw a line in the sand and say 'no more dead kids,' no more police killings and beatings,&quot; the announcement read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday night anti-police marches were a regular occurrence in downtown Oakland two years ago following the eviction of the Occupy Oakland encampments and subsequent battles between police and agitators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the marches were uneventful, but vandals struck again last July following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Florida teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agitators smashed windows of downtown businesses for three consecutive nights following the verdict. One vandal bashed a waiter in the head with a hammer outside a trendy restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police, who were criticized for not being ready to deal with last year's protests, released a statement Thursday that they have increased staffing Friday evening. &quot;The department is prepared to respond in the event that demonstrations and protests become unlawful, threaten public safety, or incite vandalism or property damage,&quot; Officer Johnna Watson wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bar Dogwood, which had its windows smashed last year during the Trayvon Martin protests, will remain open Friday, according to an employee who declined to give his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have any plans to hunker down and fortify,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown, a recent high school graduate, was shot multiple times by a Ferguson police officer Saturday afternoon. Authorities have refused to identify the police officer, and police and witness accounts differ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing has set off several days of protests that grew more violent on Wednesday as several demonstrators tossed Molotov cocktails and other objects at riot police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilwoman Lynette Gibson McElhaney said any vandalism or violence stemming from the Oakland protest would take attention away from the serious issue surrounding fatal police shootings of young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope people in Oakland get that and that we don't become the story by destroying property and endangering lives,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- About 500 people gathered Thursday afternoon in downtown Oakland for a moment of silence for victims of police brutality and to remember Michael Brown, the teen whose fatal shooting by police has rocked a suburb of St. Louis, Mo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group gathered in Oakland fell silent at 4:20 p.m. for about 10 minutes. The quiet was broken as dozens of people began raising their hands and chanting &quot;Hands up, don't shoot,&quot; a refrain used by protestors in Ferguson, Mo,, as they stood before police dressed in riot gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signs at the rally called for justice for Michael Brown and for Oscar Grant, who was shot and killed by a BART police officer in 2011, and Alan Blueford, shot and killed by an Oakland police officer in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blueford's mother, Jeralynn, told the crowd that Brown's killing had reopened emotional wounds she suffered when her son was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not 'Protect and serve,' this is 'Shoot to kill,' and I can't get my Alan back,&quot; Blueford said. &quot;But I can stand up and say, 'I'm not taking anymore.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(Michael Brown's) life mattered. I'm Mike Brown. I am Alan Blueford. You can't shoot these kids down with their hands up. ... None of these people deserved that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Moment of Silence for Victims of Police Brutality, organized online, listed 90 vigils across the country that would participate with a moment of silence and solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event at Oakland's Frank Ogawa Plaza was mirrored across the bay at San Francisco Civic Center and in cities across the country, including Chicago, Philadelphia and New York.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis has issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It shouldn't take a visit by the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist, for St. Louis to internalize that very simple statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've got issues in this city,&quot; Rev. Sharpton told a standing-room only crowd Tuesday evening at the Greater St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church near Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wasn't talking about Ferguson, or Dellwood, or Cool Valley, or Florissant, or any of the other 90 municipalities in St. Louis County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was talking about all of us in the greater St. Louis region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We knew that before Michael Brown's life was cut short Saturday afternoon by a hail of bullets fired from a police officer's gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like too many black men in St. Louis, he died too young. He was 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even without that fatal confrontation, statistics suggest Michael Brown would have died earlier than other African-American males just like him who had the good fortune of being born one ZIP code to the south and west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is but one of the startling and important conclusions of a recent Washington University study titled &quot;For the Sake of All.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The landmark study is a picture of what St. Louis has become after decades of white flight, red-lined development decisions, uneven support of public schools and an uneasy racial division that is ever-simmering just below the surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had he lived, Michael Brown's projected lifespan was about 15 years less than had he lived just a couple of ZIP codes away on the south side of Interstate 70.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In St. Louis, ZIP code is destiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before he died, before his community protested, before angry young men turned to violence and looting, Michael Brown's journey defined the biggest issues facing St. Louis today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lived in an underfunded and unaccredited school district - Normandy - that is centered amid a jigsaw puzzle of municipalities that struggle to provide basic services to a transient population living in concentrated poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those municipalities often make the poverty worse, by dinging their own residents with red-light and speeding-camera tickets, which help fund police departments that can't afford to keep and train officers with the quality of the city of St. Louis or St. Louis County police forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the luck of the draw that #Ferguson is trending on Twitter instead of any of the other patchwork of small cities where Michael Brown spent his youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His story is resonating in St. Louis, and in the nation, and the world, because it is the story of so many African-American men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown's story is the story of North County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His story is the story of St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's our story, past and present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, we have issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past year, we've embarked on a series of editorials under the banner &quot;A Greater St. Louis&quot; focusing specifically on these big issues: the need to improve our local schools; the need to unite as a region, both racially and over our arbitrary government boundaries, and the need to get beyond the very economic development policies that contributed to the concentrated poverty in both north St. Louis city and many parts of north St. Louis County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The series is a call to action for a once-great Midwestern manufacturing hub making progress, albeit slowly, after decades of decline. It is a plea for city and suburban leaders to realize that for St. Louis to be great again, we must realize that we are better together, that we are stronger as a sum of all of our parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are elements of each of these issues in both the journey of Michael Brown and the community's reaction to his death. One of the key arguments for uniting our region is that for too long, the public policy and perception has been one of isolation. We put up our proverbial (and literal) gates in West County, for example, and separate ourselves from the challenges of the urban core.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, the looting and violence in Ferguson this week feeds the fear in some mostly white suburbs. Some of them already have registered their official opposition to a movement underway to unite the various factions of St. Louis under a more well-defined regional umbrella.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis will never be great again if we don't all take responsibility for the least among us, if we don't strengthen our core first, if we don't break down the walls that divide us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For better or worse, Rev. Sharpton is right: This is now how the world sees St. Louis. Outside of the 314 area code, people don't differentiate between a QuikTrip in Dellwood or one on Big Bend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our issues, our divisions, our poverty, our troubled schools, our crime - all are laid bare. There is no more sweeping them under the carpet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge now, as the Rev. Starsky Wilson - president of the Deaconess Foundation - wrote Wednesday on his blog, is to &quot;collaborate, not compete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Wilson noted that there were competing prayer gatherings Tuesday, with Rev. Sharpton speaking to a massive and excitable crowd at one church, while Gov. Jay Nixon and other community leaders (most of them white) were speaking at a more somber gathering just a few miles away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have separate but equal prayer services. For St. Louis to move forward, those various constituencies need to be talking to each other, not at each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixty years after Brown vs. Board of Education said separate but equal wouldn't work for schools, St. Louis is still struggling with the concept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Band-Aid has been ripped off,&quot; Baltimore-based Pastor Jamal Bryant said at the Sharpton event on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis is an open wound.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS o A public cry for the name of the Ferguson police officer who killed Michael Brown is a fresh and uncommonly loud iteration of a recurring debate on the balance between police credibility and a public servant's safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although many departments around the country do release officers' names and details of use-of-force investigations, there is no consensus. And it has been far from routine in the St. Louis area, where the subject has sparked controversy for years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch insisted Wednesday that no details of the Brown investigation will be released until a grand jury reviews them. But the National Bar Association and American Civil Liberties Union positioned themselves to fight for release of information they say should be immediately public by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people protesting Saturday's shooting of Brown, 18, who was unarmed, have loudly demanded the officer's name without explaining what they would do with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Monday he would release the name once the officer and his family were somewhere safe, but later in the week declared that he would provide it only under court order or if the officer were charged with a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Roorda, business manager of the St. Louis Police Officers Association, is so opposed to release of the names that as a state legislator he once tried to pass legislation to protect them. &quot;These guys face threats during their eight-hour shifts,&quot; he said. &quot;They shouldn't have to face them at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roorda said the public's right to know can be accommodated through the normal investigative process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they did something wrong, they're going to be charged criminally and everyone should know what their name is,&quot; he said. He also acknowledged that the name could become public if a lawsuit is filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawyer said to be representing the Ferguson officer declined to comment Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local union officials representing Ferguson officers did not return calls. Kevin Ahlbrand, president of the Missouri Fraternal Order of Police, said simply, &quot;The less said the better on our part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACLU Executive Director Jeffrey Mittman said some in the public have a lack of trust in how police shootings are investigated. &quot;And we think that starting off by denying the public the right to a document we're entitled to is not the way to begin a difficult time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mittman said there is no &quot;officer risk&quot; exemption in Missouri's Sunshine Law. &quot;There are other ways of dealing with that issue,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the ACLU and National Bar have filed open records requests. The ACLU, which asked for initial incident reports from Ferguson and St. Louis County police, has not received a response from Ferguson but was turned down by the county, said Tony Rothert, its legal director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Ferguson nor the county has responded to similar requests by the Post-Dispatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Names of St. Louis city police officers who used deadly force were never officially released before 2009, although the Post-Dispatch regularly obtained them. Since that time, a policy keeps the names secret until a &quot;threat assessment&quot; clears them for release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Almost always, there's going to be some level of threat,&quot; said Neil Bruntrager, who has represented numerous officers involved in shootings and who is general counsel for the officers association. He said that releasing the name could put an officer at risk, &quot;perhaps, for years to come.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Internet complicates the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you have any social media presence, I can get a picture of you. I can find out where you live,&quot; Bruntrager said. &quot;I can follow you home. This threat now extends to whoever you live with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And that's why these things don't get released.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that in places where the names are released, &quot;Everybody is prepared for it. There is a culture change.&quot; He said officers there likely have a reduced social media or none at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social media speculation that named a particular Ferguson officer in the Brown shooting was wrong, Jackson said, and led to death threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even someone who has supported the release of officers' names following a threat assessment urged caution Wednesday in the Ferguson incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When there are death threats, you've got to take them seriously,&quot; said David Klinger, a University of Missouri-St. Louis criminologist and deadly force specialist. &quot;It would be irresponsible to release his name right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klinger's name was made public by the Los Angeles Police Department in 1981 when he killed a man who attacked a fellow officer with a butcher knife. Klinger said he &quot;didn't have a problem&quot; with it at the time, but he was protected by the anonymity of a large police department in a large city, in a case that had not become a &quot;big cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting the magnitude of the Ferguson shooting backlash, he said, &quot;Even if this was an LA cop, this would be disconcerting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outrage over a Ferguson police officer's fatal shooting of Michael Brown is partly grounded in the account of the teen's friend: Dorian Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson, 22, may be the closest eyewitness to the shooting. He has repeatedly told media since Saturday that he and Brown were walking in the middle of the street when the officer pulled up and ordered them to &quot;get the F on the sidewalk&quot; and grabbed Brown, 18, in the throat. Johnson disputed the statement by St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar that Brown reached in the car and struggled for the officer's gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson has said that the officer shot Brown, who ran. The officer ran after him and Brown put up his hands in surrender, and the officer shot him again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, on the MSNBC show All In, host Chris Hayes asked: &quot;Did Michael reach and struggle for the officer's gun as the police are saying he did?&quot; Johnson answered: &quot;That is incorrect, sir, he did not reach for a weapon at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson's statements are a significant part of what the public has heard about the encounter that ended with Brown's death. He has appeared for the past three days on national cable networks at the side of his lawyer, former St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr., and spoke Wednesday with KSDK-TV (Channel 5) reporter Farrah Fazal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities were getting a chance to hear his story Wednesday. Bosley, who complained earlier this week that investigators were not initially interested in speaking with Johnson, said Wednesday morning that he was picking up Johnson to take him to meet with authorities. Late Wednesday afternoon, St. Louis County police said they were interviewing Johnson after being unable to locate him earlier in the week. Bosley said Wednesday night that his client was meeting with FBI agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson has revealed little about himself. He attended Lincoln University in Jefferson City for two semesters in 2011, but &quot;wound up back here, struggling to find a job,&quot; Bosley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the summer after his first semester at Lincoln, Johnson was charged with a misdemeanor after giving police a false first name after he was arrested on suspicion of theft. He later pleaded guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was accused of stealing a package containing a backpack belonging to someone else from an apartment complex. When he was arrested in that case, he identified himself as Derrick Johnson and said he was 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An officer found a student ID card in his sock identifying him as Dorian Johnson. Johnson told him he was carrying a friend's ID, but two Lincoln University Police Officers recognized him as Dorian Johnson. He pleaded guilty in circuit court to a misdemeanor charge of filing a false report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is wanted for failing to appear in Jefferson City municipal court to answer to the theft charge, court officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson declined to be interviewed by the Post-Dispatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Bosley acknowledged that Johnson told him he did &quot;know something about that&quot; and that he'd ask him more about it when he got the chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several other witnesses have come forward with accounts similar to Johnson's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adolphus Pruitt, president of the St. Louis NAACP chapter, which has been encouraging witnesses to come forward, said Johnson's false report case &quot;doesn't concern me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's been very clear about what occurred, and now we have ... four others stating facts that support the statements he's been making,&quot; Pruitt said. &quot;Why would that diminish other accounts that are relatively the same?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON o Law enforcement officials on Wednesday asked for patience to allow the investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown to take its course as tension over the teenager's death continued for a fifth straight day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said his office will take as much time as necessary to review circumstances that led a Ferguson police officer to fatally shoot the 18-year-old Brown on a street Saturday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The timeline on this is there is no timeline,&quot; McCulloch told an afternoon news conference. &quot;We will do this as expeditiously as possible. But we won't rush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resisting pressure from street demonstrators and public officials for answers that show why the unnamed officer confronted Brown and a companion shortly after noon on Saturday, McCulloch said the details may not emerge until the process of collecting evidence and presenting it to the grand jury is complete. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that's not the answer anybody wants to hear at this point,&quot; he said. &quot;Everybody wants to know what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCulloch called the problem twofold. First, he said, ethical rules prevent prosecutors from disseminating the physical evidence. He also said he won't do anything to corrupt the integrity of the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to a reporter's question, McCulloch said it will certainly take more than two weeks to complete the investigation. He offered no specific estimate of the timetable. He cited a heavy volume of information that is being gathered in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to test the veracity and accuracy of anybody who comes to us,&quot; McCulloch said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCulloch said a lot of information has come forward through social media, &quot;some of it good, some of it bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed that the medical examiner's report, 911 tapes and other investigative material will be withheld at this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One new detail of Saturday's shooting did emerge Wednesday when Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson in another news conference said the officer who shot Brown suffered facial injuries and was taken to a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson also acknowledged that mending the strained relationship between his department and the African-American community is imperative for the city and region to move ahead following nearly a week of outrage, violence and looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have always had real good relations with all of the neighborhood associations,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;Apparently, there's been this undertow that now has bubbled to the surface, and it's our first priority to address it, to fix what's wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step, he added, is working with the community relations office on race relations that the U.S. Justice Department has dispatched to Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief defended the racial makeup of the Ferguson department. Three of the agency's 53 officers are African-American in a community where two-thirds of the population is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said he has worked to improve the diversity of the police department, adding it is a &quot;constant struggle to hire and retain personnel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past few years, Jackson said, he has tried not only to recruit but improve quality of life in the department, including pay levels, to retain officers longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments from law enforcement in a week that has seen forums, prayer vigils and a clergy-led parade Wednesday that passed many of the looted West Florissant Avenue businesses did little to quell the outrage spawned by Brown's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As has been the case since Monday, the parking lot of a QuikTrip looted and burned Sunday evening has been the epicenter of hostility between protesters and police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The animosity for the most part was verbal Wednesday until a thrown bottle prompted police to fire smoke bombs at the crowd shortly before 9 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police then ordered demonstrators to evacuate the area or face arrest the protesters responded that &quot;we are not going anywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police a short time later chased protesters into nearby neighborhoods after dispersing the crowd for the third straight night with tear gas grenades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, police also used piercing-sound sonic cannons to scatter the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they have since Saturday, demonstrators throughout the evening taunted and threatened police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I'm going to go, I'm taking one of you with me,&quot; warned one demonstrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another shouted, &quot;We're not dogs, so what the hell you've got those whipping sticks for? Because you want to whip us like dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A county police tactical operations armored vehicle was deployed at the demonstration site for most of the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protected by body armor, police sat atop the vehicle methodically fitting high-caliber automatic weapons into tripods which were then trained on the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are being ordered to leave now!&quot; police announced frequently through a public address system. &quot;If you don't leave peacefully there will be arrests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd ignored the demand until the tear gas was fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of midnight there were reports of sporadic gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHOOTING CHARGES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors filed felony charges Wednesday against a man shot by police in a confrontation earlier in the day near the scene of the protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esrail Britton, 19, was charged with second-degree assault on a law enforcement officer and armed criminal action. He remained hospitalized, and earlier in the day was reported to be in critical condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said they have two addresses for Britton, both of them vacant dwellings in the St. Louis area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting occurred about 1 a.m. at West Florissant Avenue and Chambers Road, in an unincorporated area of St. Louis County, as county police responded to a report of four of five men with masks and shotguns in an area where shots were heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALDERMAN FRENCH, JOURNALISTS ARRESTED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis Alderman Antonio French was among about 10 people arrested Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French was being held at the Ferguson Police Department but no details of his arrest were being released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wesley Lowery, a reporter with the Washington Post, was arrested Wednesday evening along with Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post, according to a Twitter post by Lowery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wrote that police came into the McDonald's on West Florissant where the two were working, and tried &quot;to kick everyone out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officers decided we weren't leaving McDonald's quickly enough, shouldn't have been taping them,&quot; he tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officers slammed me into a fountain soda machine because I was confused about which door they were asking me to walk out of,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that he was detained, booked, &quot;given answers to no questions. Then just let out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reilly tweeted that a SWAT team invaded the McDonald's where he was working and recharging his phone, and asked for identification when he took a photo. They tried to kick everyone out, he wrote. He wrote that he was &quot;assaulted&quot; by an officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCHOOL START DELAYED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continuing unrest forced the Ferguson-Florissant school district to postpone the start of school from today to Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In order to allow additional time for the situation to stabilize and for all of our students and their families to resume normal routines, we will reschedule the first day of school,&quot; district officials said in a statement. &quot;We believe that this change will help ensure a strong start to the new school year.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A riot can be many things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be an act of communal madness, reflecting the emotional imbecility of those who believe the best way to express joy at their ball team's win is to overturn a car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be an act of opportunism, a chance, under cover of darkness, influence of chaos, suspension of order, to smash and grab and run away, arms heavy with loot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it can be an act of outcry, a scream of inchoate rage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what happened this week in Ferguson, Missouri. The people screamed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To believe that this carnage - the windows smashed, the buildings torched, the tear gas wafting - is all about the killing of Michael Brown is to miss the point. Brown, of course, was the unarmed 18-year-old African-American man shot multiple times by a Ferguson police officer on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar - Ferguson police asked his department, as an outside agency, to investigate the shooting - has said Brown was walking with another individual when a so-far unnamed officer sitting in a police car stopped him. According to Belmar, the officer was trying to get out of his car when one of the two individuals pushed him back inside, where there was a struggle over the officer's weapon and at least one shot was discharged. He says the officer came out of the car and fired, striking Brown, who was about 35 feet away, multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses say Brown, who was to have started college this week, had his hands up when he was shot. Police have not said why the officer felt the need to stop him in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details are still too sketchy for us to draw hard conclusions about what happened that afternoon. But it is all too easy to understand what happened afterward and why good people should be paying attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because, again, this is not just about Brown. It's about Eric Garner, choked to death in a confrontation with New York City Police. It's about Jordan Davis, shot to death in Jacksonville because he played his music too loud. It's about Trayvon Martin, shot to death in Sanford because a self-appointed neighborhood guardian judged him a thug. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's about Oscar Grant, shot by a police officer in an Oakland, California, subway station as cellphone cameras watched. It's about Amadou Diallo, executed in that vestibule, and Abner Louima, sodomized with that broomstick. It's about Rodney King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is about the bitter sense of siege that lives in African-American men, a sense that it is perpetually open season on us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that too few people outside of African America really notice, much less care. People who look like you are every day deprived of health, wealth, freedom, opportunity, education, the benefit of the doubt, the presumption of innocence, life itself - and when you try to say this, even when you document it with academic studies and buttress it with witness testimony, people don't want to hear it, people dismiss you, deny you, lecture you about white victimhood, chastise you for playing a so-called race card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They choke off avenues of protest, prizing silence over justice, mistaking silence for peace. And nevermind that sometimes, silence simmers like water in a closed pot on a high flame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One can never condone a riot. It is a self-defeating act that sells some fleeting illusion of satisfaction at a high cost in property and life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But understanding this does not preclude recognizing that the anger we see in Ferguson did not spring from nowhere, nor arrive, fully-formed, when Michael Brown was shot. It is the anger of people who are, as Fannie Lou Hamer famously said, sick and tired of being sick and tired.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hacking collective known as Anonymous is trying to shine a light on the roots of the racial violence in a St. Louis suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Aug. 13, the group published hours of alleged police dispatch tapes from the day Ferguson, Mo., police shot and killed unarmed teen Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That same day, one of a handful of Twitter accounts claiming to be associated with the Anonymous group posted comments they say came from the wife of Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of people in Ferguson, a woman identified as Catherine Nardi wrote: &quot;They are feral and violent. They murder each other. They murder their unborn babies. They murder white people. They hate police officers and murder some of them, even black ones. They destroy neighbors and entire cities with garbage and drugs. They live their lives off the hard-earned tax dollars of other Americans. Yet somehow they are victims. What insanity is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments have been retweeted more than 5,400 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the person in the Facebook message, Catherine Nardi, is not the wife of the Ferguson police chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nardi lives in St. Petersburg, Fla., not Missouri, according to public records. She is married to Henry Nardi, who is not the police chief of Ferguson. We reached out to Nardi via Facebook, but she did not respond. A woman answering a phone number associated with her hung up on a reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Jackson's wife is named Patricia, not Catherine. We were unable to reach Jackson's wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the specific words in the message, we did not find them on Nardi's Facebook page or anywhere else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A post from a group claiming that it is associated with Anonymous said that the wife of the Ferguson, Mo., police chief said African-Americans in Ferguson &quot;are feral and violent,&quot; among other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tweet references a Facebook post that is not from Jackson's wife. The woman in the picture lives in Florida not Missouri.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Ferguson, Missouri, fired several rounds of tear gas to disperse protesters late on Wednesday, on the fourth night of demonstrations over the fatal shooting last weekend of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer. <BR><BR>Clouds of smoke lingered above an area hit with police tear gas police as the crowd of some 350 protesters scattered off into side streets and into cars. Someone from the crowd appeared to throw an object at police.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two journalists, Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of Huffington Post, were arrested on Wednesday, and then released, while working in the area. <BR><BR>Michael Brown, 18, was shot to death in the mostly black suburb of Ferguson, Missouri on Saturday after what police said was a struggle with a gun in a police car. <BR><BR>A witness in the case told local media that Brown had raised his arms to police to show that he was unarmed before being killed. <BR><BR>Protesters have gathered in the St. Louis suburb every night since in tense standoffs with heavily armed police. <BR><BR>&quot;I've had enough of being pushed around because of the color of my skin, I'm sick of this police brutality and I'm angry cause of what they done to Michael Brown,&quot; said one protester, 18, who would identify himself only by his first name, Terrell. <BR><BR>&quot;I'm going to keep coming back here night after night until we get justice,&quot; he said. <BR><BR>Police have been slow to release information about the shooting, except to say that it followed a struggle between the unnamed officer and Brown. <BR><BR>Details about the incident are in dispute. A witness who was walking with Brown at the time has said in media interviews that Brown put his hands in the air and was not struggling with the officer. He said the officer fired multiple times into Brown's head and chest. <BR><BR>The witness, Dorian Johnson, was expected to meet on Wednesday with prosecutors and investigators, local media reported. His lawyer, Freeman Bosley, a former St. Louis mayor, did not immediately answer requests for comment. <BR><BR>Police have declined to release the name of the officer involved in the incident, citing concerns for his safety, a decision that has been criticized by demonstrators who have asked for more transparency. The officer has been placed on administrative leave. <BR><BR>Police Chief Thomas Jackson told a news conference earlier on Wednesday that his priority was improving race relations in Ferguson, which has seen a stark demographic shift in recent decades, going from mostly white to mostly black. About two-thirds of the town's 21,000-strong population are black. On a police force of 53, three officers are black.<BR><BR><BR>&quot;This is an opportunity to fix what's wrong,&quot; he said. <BR><BR>The local Ferguson-Florissant school district meanwhile postponed its first day of classes until Monday, cancelling classes for this Thursday and Friday. <BR><BR>TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT <BR><BR>Ferguson residents were still trying to make sense out of what happened on Wednesday. <BR><BR>&quot;I cannot condone violence, but I definitely understand where the anger of young black men comes from at times like this. I don't think until you've experienced that kind of treatment that you can understand it,&quot; said Mike McCoy, 41, who runs an African-American youth program. <BR><BR>McCoy, who said he has been a victim of racial profiling by local police, was visiting a memorial of candles, teddy bears and messages near where Brown was killed. <BR><BR>National figures from President Barack Obama to civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton have called for a peaceful response to the shooting. <BR><BR>About 40 protesters have been arrested since Saturday. <BR><BR>After Tuesday night's protests were broken up by tear gas, a St. Louis County Police officer shot and critically wounded a 19-year-old male who allegedly pointed a gun at the officer. The man, who was identified on Wednesday evening as Esran Britton, had been involved with the earlier protests, police said. <BR><BR>&quot;I have been in fear since Saturday night that something like this would happen,&quot; Jon Belmar, the St Louis County police chief, said at an evening news conference. &quot;It's remarkable that we haven't had more problems but I am hopeful the unrest will come to an end soon.&quot; <BR><BR>Meanwhile, police in California were investigating a separate incident of an officer fatally shooting an unarmed 25-year-old black man in Los Angeles. <BR><BR>On social media, groups claiming to be associated with the Anonymous hacker activist group called for nationwide protests and threatened to reveal personal information about Ferguson police officers. <BR><BR>The Ferguson police said there have been attempts to hack their website and that it was temporarily disrupted. <BR><BR>Ferguson Police spokesman Tim Zoll said the cyber-threats prompted the decision not to release the officer's name.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who has been the public face of the city torn by Saturday's death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, told reporters the St. Louis County investigation of the shooting could take weeks to complete. In the meantime, he said, his department welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force's 53 officers are white. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marilyn Jean Hartman, 62, was sentenced to 177 days in jail for going back to the Los Angeles International Airport last week and wandering through the terminals after a judge ordered her to stay away from the facility, said Frank Mateljan, spokesman for the L.A. city attorney's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hartman previously made repeated attempts to sneak aboard flights at other airports, according to authorities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics say more study is needed on the effects of the herbicide and they are concerned it could endanger public health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to rule this fall on Dow AgroSciences' application to market Enlist, a new version of the 2,4-D herbicide that has been around since the 1940s.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state would also need to start recognizing gay marriages from out of state next Wednesday, though the U.S. Supreme Court could effectively put same-sex marriages on hold again if opponents of same-sex marriage are able to win an emergency delay.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. CREDITS STRIKES WITH ALLOWING IRAQIS TO ESCAPE: Crediting U.S. airstrikes and humanitarian aid, the Obama administration said Wednesday many trapped Iraqis have fled a mountain where they had sought refuge from militants, making it less likely the military would have to carry out a potentially dangerous rescue mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assessment came after U.S. troops secretly scouted Sinjar Mountain on Wednesday, revealing far fewer people than originally thought - only several thousand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said six days of U.S. airstrikes against militant targets in the region gave many people an opportunity to get off the mountain. He also said the food and water supplies the U.S. airdropped to the refugees helped to sustain them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests were met with tear gas Wednesday night hours after the city's police chief went before the public to urge calm, saying that healing racial discord here has become a &quot;top priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions have flared since a police officer, still unidentified, fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was walking to his grandmother's home Saturday afternoon with a friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday brought a fourth night of violence, even after city officials issued a statement expressing sympathy for the Brown family and asking people to confine their demonstrations to daylight hours. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police used tear gas to try to disperse protesters after flaming projectiles were thrown from the crowd. Police also used smoke bombs after directing people to go home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post said they were handcuffed and put into a police van after officers came in to quickly clear a fast-food restaurant where they were doing some work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post reported that Lowery said that he was slammed against a soda machine and plastic cuffs were put on his wrists. The reporters were subsequently released without any charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of officers set up barricades throughout the city, blocking most main roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police yelled &quot;Hold the line&quot; and &quot;Stop your vehicle.&quot; As vehicles approached a QuickTrip store that burned Monday, officers in bullet-proof vests drew and pointed rifles at the cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Race relations is a top priority right now,&quot; Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said, adding that he welcomes outside help. &quot;I've been trying to increase the diversity of the department since I got here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Americans are two-thirds of the population of this St. Louis suburb, but they account for nine out of 10 stops by police. The 53-member police force includes three African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In discussing the original incident, Jackson has said the officer was assaulted by Brown and that the officer was pushed into his squad car, where a scuffle over his gun resulted in a gunshot. They emerged from the car and the officer fired several shots. Brown lay dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His friend, Dorian Johnson, tells a sharply different story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson, 22, told KSDK-TV that a white officer shot Brown &quot;like an animal&quot; in the head and chest as the teen put his hands in the air. He said the incident started around 1:40 p.m. Saturday when the officer pulled up beside the pair as they were walking down the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He didn't say freeze, halt or anything like we were committing a crime,&quot; Johnson told KSDK. &quot;He said, 'Get the 'F' on the sidewalk.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer then shoved open the car door, grabbed Brown around the neck and was pulling him through the window, Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The second time he says, 'I'll shoot.' A second later, the gun went off, and he let go,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;That's how we were able to run at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said he ducked behind a car as the officer continued shooting, hitting Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His (Brown's) hands immediately went into the air and he turned around to the officer,&quot;  he recalled. &quot;My friend started to tell the officer that he was unarmed and that he could stop shooting (him). Before he could get his second sentence out, the officer fired several more shots into his head and chest area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson added, &quot;I definitely think (the officer) is guilty of murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said his department is working with the Justice Department's community relations experts to address the community's racial strife. He said he hoped to arrange a meeting with Brown's relatives as early as today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police refused again  Wednesday to identify the officer or his race, citing threats that have been made against the police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Bar Association, whose membership is predominantly African-American, filed a records request  demanding the name, gender, rank, race, age and seniority of the officer. The organization also asked for information about the past conduct of the officer and any information about his or her use or alleged use of force against any suspects while with the Ferguson Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe for the sake of transparency and for the sake of bringing calmness to the community, it is imperative that they release the name,&quot; said the association's president, Pamela Meanes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis city and county are among the most segregated areas in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priscilla Dowden-White, a history professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said the anger, rioting and violence that have shaken Ferguson are a legacy of the region's racial segregation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pentagon might not have boots on the ground in Ferguson, Mo., where 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot by police on Saturday, but it does have wheels on the street. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle McCaskill, media relations chief at the Defense Logistics Agency, confirms that the Ferguson Police Department is part of a federal program called 1033 that distributes hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus military equipment to civilian police forces across the United States. The materials range from small items, such as pistols and automatic rifles, to heavy armored vehicles such as the MRAPs used in Afghanistan and Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 2013 alone, $449,309,003.71 worth of property was transferred to law enforcement,&quot; the agency's website states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to McCaskill, the most recent transfer of military equipment from the Department of Defense to small Ferguson was in November and included two vehicles as well as a trailer and a generator. Details on the vehicles and their intended uses have not been released by the Pentagon. Information on any prior transfers is also unavailable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A state public safety official told USA TODAY that the Pentagon does not allow detailed information on &quot;tactical&quot; equipment to be released at a police force level, only at a county level. According to a document provided by the official, police forces in the same county as Ferguson received advanced rifle sights and night vision equipment between 2012 and 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no evidence that any such equipment has yet been used in the Brown case and its aftermath. But such &quot;police militarization&quot; is just one element of an often toxic relationship between minority communities and local police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the creation of the 1033 program by Congress in the early 1990s, the program has distributed $4.3 billion of excess equipment, ranging from innocuous office supplies to bomb-disposing robots and other advanced technology. The flood of military supplies -- along with the continuing drug war and grant programs from other federal agencies that provide military-style equipment -- has pushed the culture of police forces far from its law-enforcement roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the motto of the 1033 program is &quot;From Warfighter to Crimefighter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it is not a surprise that police officers often seem prepared for war. In Ferguson, that change is most dramatically revealed in the images of camouflage-wearing police officers with assault rifles, body armor and multiple extra magazines facing unarmed protesters with their hands preemptively raised in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disturbing trend of police militarization permits law enforcement agencies to view people in their communities as threats, rather than as citizens with rights, reports The Washington Post's Radley Balko, who has covered the militarization of the police extensively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere in Missouri, agencies participating in the 1033 program have acquired &quot;aircraft (both fixed wing and rotary) and four-wheel drive vehicles (such as pickup trucks, blazers, ambulances and armored personnel carriers),&quot; according to the state's Department of Public Safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there's one thing a community in turmoil does not need is for anyone to turn up the heat as protesters and police face off and tempers simmer. But before a local police officer fired his first shot at the unarmed teen, the U.S. military helped make sure there was plenty of fuel to bring things to a boil.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After four days of angry calls for reform and tear gas lobbed at protesters, the city's police chief said Wednesday that healing racial discord here has become a &quot;top priority&quot; and he welcomes outside help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Race relations is a top priority right now,&quot; Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said. &quot;I've been trying to increase the diversity of the department since I got here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Americans are two-thirds of the population of this St. Louis suburb, but they account for nine out of 10 stops by police. The 53-member police force includes three African Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That disparity has led to long-simmering tensions that flared when a police officer, still unidentified, fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was walking to his grandmother's home Saturday afternoon with a friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson has said the officer was assaulted by Brown and that the officer was pushed into his squad car, where a scuffle over his gun resulted in a gunshot. They emerged from the car and the officer fired several shots. Brown lay dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His friend, Dorian Johnson, tells a sharply different story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson, 22, told KSDK-TV that a white officer shot Brown &quot;like an animal&quot; in the head and chest as the teen put his hands in the air. He said the incident started around 1:40 p.m. Saturday when the officer pulled up beside the pair as they were walking down the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He didn't say freeze, halt or anything like we were committing a crime,&quot; Johnson told KSDK. &quot;He said, 'Get the 'F' on the sidewalk.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer then shoved open the car door, grabbed Brown around the neck and was pulling him through the window, Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The second time he says, 'I'll shoot.' A second later, the gun went off, and he let go,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;That's how we were able to run at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said he ducked behind a car as the officer continued shooting at them, hitting Brown in the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His (Brown's) hands immediately went into the air and he turned around to the officer,&quot;  he recalled. &quot;My friend started to tell the officer that he was unarmed and that he could stop shooting (him). Before he could get his second sentence out, the officer fired several more shots into his head and chest area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson added: &quot;It was definitely like being shot like an animal. ... I definitely think (the officer) is guilty of murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoping to avert a fourth night of violence, city officials issued a statement Wednesday expressing sympathy for the Brown family and asking people to confine their demonstrations to daylight hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said his department is working with the Justice Department's community relations experts to address the community's racial strife. He said he hoped to arrange a meeting with Brown's relatives as early as Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police refused again  Wednesday to identify the officer or his race, citing threats that have been made against the police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Bar Association, whose membership is predominantly African-American, filed a records request Wednesday demanding the name, gender, rank, race, age and seniority of the officer. The organization also asked for information about the past conduct of the officer and any information about his or her use or alleged use of force against any suspects while with the Ferguson Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe for the sake of transparency and for the sake of bringing calmness to the community, it is imperative that they release the name,&quot; said the association's president, Pamela Meanes. She said if the officer's name isn't disclosed by Monday, her group would ask a county judge to order police to release it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis city and county are among the most segregated areas in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priscilla Dowden-White, a history professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said the anger, rioting and violence that have shaken Ferguson are a legacy of the region's racial segregation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is rooted in how the St. Louis community developed racially,&quot; she said. &quot;This was a situation that was bound to occur.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis was at the epicenter of the fight against housing discrimination against blacks. In 1916, the city passed an ordinance that prohibited blacks from buying homes in or moving to predominantly white communities. The law was struck down in 1917.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But racially restricted covenants, which prohibited homeowners from selling a house to blacks, remained in effect until 1948, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck  the legally binding agreements after hearing the case of a black St. Louis home buyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dowden-White said what followed was a migration of blacks to the northern suburbs of St. Louis County, including Ferguson. Still, real estate agents steered African Americans in certain directions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;African Americans were relegated to certain communities,&quot; Dowden-White said. That segregation, along with high unemployment, no wealth, low homeownership and few quality schools, resulted in communities steeped in poverty, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we are seeing is the impact of poverty,&quot; she said. &quot;And the legacy of poverty breeds a volatile situation. ... We are seeing the response of people who are angry and cannot see a way out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson, she said, is emblematic of low-income neighborhoods nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keyla Brown, 20, lives in Canfield Green Apartments, where Brown was shot. She said police have routinely driven into neighborhood parking lots and harassed people. She and her boyfriend, John West, 20, said they were pulled over in Ferguson six months ago and treated like criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terrell Marshall, 24, of Ferguson, said he has experienced what those numbers mean firsthand. In July, he said, he was walking home through Canfield Green Apartments, where Brown was shot, when police officers stopped him. The officers grabbed his luggage, emptied his belongings onto the ground and searched him, he said. He said he went along with the treatment he has seen others in his neighborhood endure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police have been harassing people for a long time,&quot; he said. &quot;The shooting shed some light on this, but there is still stuff out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Common Dreams has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Ferguson, Missouri on Wednesday arrested reporters and activists, launched tear gas at protesters, and used armored tanks and helicopters to force media out as residents continued to demand answers about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot to death by an officer last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis alderman Antonio French, who had helped organize demonstrations and provide live updates on Twitter, was arrested for &quot;unlawful assembly&quot; after police forced him out of his car and told him he &quot;didn't listen,&quot; according to French's wife, Jasenka Benac French. <BR>Two reporters, Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of Huffington Post, were also taken into custody in a foreboding encounter recorded on Lowery's cell phone. An officer can be seen demanding that Lowery stop filming and refusing to answer questions. In a blog post about his experience, Lowery writes: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Multiple officers grabbed me. I tried to turn my back to them to assist them in arresting me. I dropped the things from my hands. &quot;My hands are behind my back,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm not resisting. I'm not resisting.&quot; At which point one officer said: &quot;You're resisting. Stop resisting.&quot; That was when I was most afraid -- more afraid than of the tear gas and rubber bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photos and videos from Wednesday night show chaotic scenes as protesters run from police firing rubber bullets through thick clouds of smoke from tear gas canisters. Police also fired tear gas directly at an Al Jazeera camera crew, who had set up equipment to film the protests; after they ran to escape the fumes, officers broke down their cameras. <BR>Missouri Governor Jay Nixon made his first comment on the events on Thursday morning after five days of demonstrations and police brutality. &quot;The worsening situation in Ferguson is deeply troubling, and does not represent who we are as Missourians or as Americans,&quot; Nixon said in a press release. &quot;While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri) also said she plans to speak with Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday. The FBI joined the investigation into Brown's death earlier this week to determine whether there had been civil rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was killed over the weekend when a police officer shot him multiple times. Brown was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions between police and residents were high throughout the weekend, particularly as officers responded to peaceful demonstrations by dressing in riot gear and holding rifles and attack dogs. But the protests reached a turning point when the department suddenly refused to release the identity of the officer who fatally shot Brown, despite police chief Tom Jackson's promise to announce the name on Tuesday. Jackson claimed the officer's safety was at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACLU of Missouri sent a letter (PDF) to Jackson on Wednesday warning him that his officers violating the First Amendment by preventing media access to the city and demanding that residents &quot;limit themselves to assembling during daylight hours and protest in a 'respectful manner.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government agencies do not get to demand respect from protesters,&quot; the letter read. &quot;Respect is something that government officials earn from citizens, and citizens are entitled to express their lack of respect by protest on public streets and sidewalks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents were also angered and demoralized by the militarization of the police response, as officers crack down on demonstrations with tanks, helicopters, and rifles, setting a scene that resembles a war zone more than a town in the U.S. Lowery told NPR that many Ferguson officers &quot;are in riot gear, SWAT gear, carrying very heavy weapons... not standard-issue stuff. This is the type of stuff that you see National Guards employ, not what you expect to see from a police officer in suburban St. Louis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Twitter, Gaza residents sent messages to Ferguson protesters with instructions on how to escape and recover from tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howard University students also shared a powerful image of their solidarity, as thousands of students gathered into a single photo with their empty arms raised in the air.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of Michael Brown's shooting death at the hands of a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri last weekend, a new movement on Twitter is criticizing media portrayals of young black Americans as thuggish and violent with the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Started by Twitter user @CJ_Musick_Lawya, #IfTheyGunnedMeDown is populated by users posting two pictures of themselves, side by side, showing them in contrasting images -- one clean-cut and accomplished, the other appearing stereotypically &quot;thuggish.&quot; The hashtag accompanying the photos questions which image the media would use, out of context, in the case of their death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American Civil Liberties Union, The Government of USA has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting in meetings in the United Nation's ornate Wilson Palace by the shores of Lake Geneva in the shadow of the Alps seems an odd place to discuss racial discrimination in the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the problems of racial discrimination quickly hit home at an event earlier this week that hosted the parents of Travon Martin and Jordan Davis, two unarmed young black men killed by armed white men claiming to be acting in self-defense. Made all the more powerful as it came on the heels of the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., their affecting and often harrowing testimony immediately erased the distance between Switzerland and the United States. It made the discrimination present and underscored the importance of the work being done here at the U.N.'s review of the U.S. record of racial discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event hosted by the U.S. Human Rights Network came just before the start of the U.N. review of U.S. compliance with the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), which was ratified by the United States in 1994. Jordan's father and Trayvon's mother described their loss, unimaginable to any parent, with grace and a fierce determination to make sense of senseless acts. Recounting their families' memory of and love for their slain relatives, both parents expressed frustration and bewilderment over the failure of their sons' assailants and much of society to recognize the value of their sons' lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This theme of the devaluation of the lives of people of color ran throughout the comments of all of the speakers. They described their own and others' experiences, of immigrant child agricultural laborers working without the protections offered children in every other type of employment; black and brown women incarcerated for lengthy periods pursuant to unfair drug laws; black girls prescribed powerful and harmful psychotropic drugs based on behavioral expectations shaped by racial and gender stereotypes; families of color subjected to predatory, toxic mortgages; foreign workers subjected to virtual slavery by a severely flawed American guest worker program that invites labor trafficking and other abuses; and unarmed children shot after arguments about the volume of radios or for being perceived as a threat simply while walking down the street. Each instance described how people of color are denied their right to enjoy childhood, even their very right to life itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil and human rights are rooted in a belief in the fundamental value of every individual regardless of race or ethnicity. The advocates in Geneva appear before the United Nations in frustration and hope - frustration at the failure of the U.S. government to sufficiently assure the rights of all of its residents, and hope that pressure from the CERD Committee can assure American treaty compliance and affirm the fundamental value of all individuals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American Civil Liberties Union, The Government of USA has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This piece originally ran on TomDispatch and was completed before Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo. Police, rather than keeping the peace, have reacted to largely peaceful protests demanding justice for Michael Brown in an aggressive and militarized fashion. The ACLU of Missouri is currently on the ground in Ferguson, Mo., observing police conduct and educating protestors of their rights. You have the constitutional right to not only protest peacefully in public, but you also have the right to record police officers as they carry out their duties to serve and protect you, the citizen. For more on how police forces have become so excessively militarized, please see the ACLU report, &quot;War Come Home.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jason Westcott was afraid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One night last fall, he discovered via Facebook that a friend of a friend was planning with some co-conspirators to break in to his home. They were intent on stealing Wescott's handgun and a couple of TV sets. According to the Facebook message, the suspect was planning on &quot;burning&quot; Westcott, who promptly called the Tampa Bay police and reported the plot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Tampa Bay Times, the investigating officers responding to Westcott's call had a simple message for him: &quot;If anyone breaks into this house, grab your gun and shoot to kill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 7:30 pm on May 27th, the intruders arrived. Westcott followed the officers' advice, grabbed his gun to defend his home, and died pointing it at the intruders. They used a semiautomatic shotgun and handgun to shoot down the 29-year-old motorcycle mechanic. He was hit three times, once in the arm and twice in his side, and pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intruders, however, weren't small-time crooks looking to make a small score. Rather they were members of the Tampa Bay Police Department's SWAT team, which was executing a search warrant on suspicion that Westcott and his partner were marijuana dealers. They had been tipped off by a confidential informant, whom they drove to Westcott's home four times between February and May to purchase small amounts of marijuana, at $20-$60 a pop. The informer notified police that he saw two handguns in the home, which was why the Tampa Bay police deployed a SWAT team to execute the search warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, the same police department that told Westcott to protect his home with defensive force killed him when he did. After searching his small rental, the cops indeed found weed, two dollars' worth, and one legal handgun -- the one he was clutching when the bullets ripped into him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome to a new era of American policing, where cops increasingly see themselves as soldiers occupying enemy territory, often with the help of Uncle Sam's armory, and where even nonviolent crimes are met with overwhelming force and brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The War on Your Doorstep</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cancer of militarized policing has long been metastasizing in the body politic. It has been growing ever stronger since the first Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams were born in the 1960s in response to that decade's turbulent mix of riots, disturbances, and senseless violence like Charles Whitman's infamous clock-tower rampage in Austin, Texas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While SWAT isn't the only indicator that the militarization of American policing is increasing, it is the most recognizable. The proliferation of SWAT teams across the country and their paramilitary tactics have spread a violent form of policing designed for the extraordinary but in these years made ordinary. When the concept of SWAT arose out of the Philadelphia and Los Angeles Police Departments, it was quickly picked up by big city police officials nationwide. Initially, however, it was an elite force reserved for uniquely dangerous incidents, such as active shooters, hostage situations, or large-scale disturbances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly a half-century later, that's no longer true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1984, according to Radley Balko's Rise of the Warrior Cop, about 26% of towns with populations between 25,000 and 50,000 had SWAT teams. By 2005, that number had soared to 80% and it's still rising, though SWAT statistics are notoriously hard to come by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the number of SWAT teams has grown nationwide, so have the raids. Every year now, there are approximately 50,000 SWAT raids in the United States, according to Professor Pete Kraska of Eastern Kentucky University's School of Justice Studies. In other words, roughly 137 times a day a SWAT team assaults a home and plunges its inhabitants and the surrounding community into terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upping the Racial Profiling Ante</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recently released report, &quot;War Comes Home,&quot; the American Civil Liberties Union (my employer) discovered that nearly 80% of all SWAT raids it reviewed between 2011 and 2012 were deployed to execute a search warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pause here a moment and consider that these violent home invasions are routinely used against people who are only suspected of a crime. Up-armored paramilitary teams now regularly bash down doors in search of evidence of a possible crime. In other words, police departments increasingly choose a tactic that often results in injury and property damage as its first option, not the one of last resort. In more than 60% of the raids the ACLU investigated, SWAT members rammed down doors in search of possible drugs, not to save a hostage, respond to a barricade situation, or neutralize an active shooter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side of that broken-down door, more often than not, are blacks and Latinos. When the ACLU could identify the race of the person or people whose home was being broken into, 68% of the SWAT raids against minorities were for the purpose of executing a warrant in search of drugs. When it came to whites, that figure dropped to 38%, despite the well-known fact that blacks, whites, and Latinos all use drugs at roughly the same rates. SWAT teams, it seems, have a disturbing record of disproportionately applying their specialized skill set within communities of color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think of this as racial profiling on steroids in which the humiliation of stop and frisk is raised to a terrifying new level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyday Militarization</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't think, however, that the military mentality and equipment associated with SWAT operations are confined to those elite units. Increasingly, they're permeating all forms of policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Karl Bickel, a senior policy analyst with the Justice Department's Community Policing Services office, observes, police across America are being trained in a way that emphasizes force and aggression. He notes that recruit training favors a stress-based regimen that's modeled on military boot camp rather than on the more relaxed academic setting a minority of police departments still employ. The result, he suggests, is young officers who believe policing is about kicking ass rather than working with the community to make neighborhoods safer. Or as comedian Bill Maher reminded officers recently: &quot;The words on your car, 'protect and serve,' refer to us, not you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This authoritarian streak runs counter to the core philosophy that supposedly dominates twenty-first-century American thinking: community policing. Its emphasis is on a mission of &quot;keeping the peace&quot; by creating and maintaining partnerships of trust with and in the communities served. Under the community model, which happens to be theofficial policing philosophy of the U.S. government, officers are protectors but also problem solvers who are supposed to care, first and foremost, about how their communities see them. They don't command respect, the theory goes: they earn it. Fear isn't supposed to be their currency. Trust is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, police recruiting videos, as in those from California's Newport Beach Police Department and New Mexico's Hobbs Police Department, actively play up not the community angle but militarization as a way of attracting young men with the promise of Army-style adventure and high-tech toys. Policing, according to recruiting videos like these, isn't about calmly solving problems; it's about you and your boys breaking down doors in the middle of the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SWAT's influence reaches well beyond that. Take the increasing adoption of battle-dress uniforms (BDUs) for patrol officers. These militaristic, often black, jumpsuits, Bickel fears, make them less approachable and possibly also more aggressive in their interactions with the citizens they're supposed to protect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small project at Johns Hopkins University seemed to bear this out. People were shown pictures of police officers in their traditional uniforms and in BDUs. Respondents, the survey indicated, would much rather have a police officer show up in traditional dress blues. Summarizing its findings, Bickel writes, &quot;The more militaristic look of the BDUs, much like what is seen in news stories of our military in war zones, gives rise to the notion of our police being an occupying force in some inner city neighborhoods, instead of trusted community protectors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where Do They Get Those Wonderful Toys?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wonder if I can get in trouble for doing this,&quot; the young man says to his buddy in the passenger seat as they film the Saginaw County Sheriff Office's new toy: a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle. As they film the MRAP from behind, their amateur video has a Red Dawn-esque feel, as if an occupying military were now patrolling this Michigan county's streets. &quot;This is getting ready for f**king crazy times, dude,&quot; one young man comments. &quot;Why,&quot; his friend replies, &quot;has our city gotten that f**king bad?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, nothing happening in Saginaw County warranted the deployment of an armored vehicle capable of withstanding bullets and the sort of improvised explosive devices that insurgent forces have regularly planted along roads in America's recent war zones. Sheriff William Federspiel, however, fears the worst. &quot;As sheriff of the county, I have to put ourselves in the best position to protect our citizens and protect our property,&quot; he told a reporter. &quot;I have to prepare for something disastrous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucky for Federspiel, his exercise in paranoid disaster preparedness didn't cost his office a penny. That $425,000 MRAP came as a gift, courtesy of Uncle Sam, from one of our far-flung counterinsurgency wars. The nasty little secret of policing's militarization is that taxpayers are subsidizing it through programs overseen by the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Justice Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the 1033 program. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) may be an obscure agency within the Department of Defense, but through the 1033 program, which it oversees, it's one of the core enablers of American policing's excessive militarization. Beginning in 1990, Congress authorized the Pentagon to transfer its surplus property free of charge to federal, state, and local police departments to wage the war on drugs. In 1997, Congress expanded the purpose of the program to include counterterrorism in section 1033 of the defense authorization bill. In one single page of a 450-page law, Congress helped sow the seeds of today's warrior cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount of military hardware transferred through the program has grown astronomically over the years. In 1990, the Pentagon gave $1 million worth of equipment to U.S. law enforcement. That number had jumped to nearly $450 million in 2013. Overall, the program has shipped off more than $4.3 billion worth of materiel to state and local cops, according to the DLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its recent report, the ACLU found a disturbing range of military gear being transferred to civilian police departments nationwide. Police in North Little Rock, Arkansas, for instance, received 34 automatic and semi-automatic rifles, two robots that can be armed, military helmets, and a Mamba tactical vehicle. Police in Gwinnet County, Georgia, received 57 semi-automatic rifles, mostly M-16s and M-14s. The Utah Highway Patrol, according to a Salt Lake City Tribuneinvestigation, got an MRAP from the 1033 program, and Utah police received 1,230 rifles and four grenade launchers. After South Carolina's Columbia Police Department received its very own MRAP worth $658,000, its SWAT Commander Captain E.M. Marsh noted that 500 similar vehicles had been distributed to law enforcement organizations across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Astoundingly, one-third of all war materiel parceled out to state, local, and tribal police agencies is brand new. This raises further disconcerting questions: Is the Pentagon simply wasteful when it purchases military weapons and equipment with taxpayer dollars? Or could this be another downstream, subsidized market for defense contractors? Whatever the answer, the Pentagon is actively distributing weaponry and equipment made for U.S. counterinsurgency campaigns abroad to police who patrol American streets and this is considered sound policy in Washington. The message seems striking enough: what might be necessary for Kabul might also be necessary for DeKalb County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, the twenty-first-century war on terror has melded thoroughly with the twentieth-century war on drugs, and the result couldn't be anymore disturbing: police forces that increasingly look and act like occupying armies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice Are Up-Armoring the Police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police departments look to muscle up their arms and tactics, the Pentagon isn't the only game in town. Civilian agencies are in on it, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a 2011 investigation, reporters Andrew Becker and G.W. Schulz discovered that, since 9/11, police departments watching over some of the safest places in America have used $34 billion in grant funding from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to militarize in the name of counterterrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Fargo, North Dakota, for example, the city and its surrounding county went on an $8 million spending spree with federal money, according to Becker and Schulz. Although the area averaged less than two murders a year since 2005, every squad car is now armed with an assault rifle. Police also have access to Kevlar helmets that can stop heavy firepower as well as an armored truck worth approximately $250,000. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1,500 beat cops have been trained to use AR-15 assault rifles with homeland security grant funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with the 1033 program, neither DHS nor state and local governments account for how the equipment, including body armor and drones, is used. While the rationale behind stocking up on these military-grade supplies is invariably the possibility of a terrorist attack, school shooting, or some other horrific event, the gear is normally used to conduct paramilitary drug raids, as Balko notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the most startling source of police militarization is the Department of Justice, the very agency officially dedicated to spreading the community policing model through its Community Oriented Policing Services office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1988, Congress authorized the Byrne grant programs in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which gave state and local police federal funds to enlist in the government's drug war. That grant program, according to Balko, led to the creation of regional and multi-jurisdictional narcotics task forces, which gorged themselves on federal money and, with little federal, state, or local oversight, spent it beefing up their weapons and tactics. In 2011, 585 of these task forces operated off of Byrne grant funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grants, Balko reports, also incentivized the type of policing that has made the war on drugs such a destructive force in American society. The Justice Department doled out Byrne grants based on how many arrests officers made, how much property they seized, and how many warrants they served. The very things these narcotics task forces did very well. &quot;As a result,&quot; Balko writes, &quot;we have roving squads of drug cops, loaded with SWAT gear, who get money if they conduct more raids, make more arrests, and seize more property, and they are virtually immune to accountability if they get out of line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of whether this militarization has occurred due to federal incentives or executive decision-making in police departments or both, police across the nation are up-armoring with little or no public debate. In fact, when the ACLU requested SWAT records from 255 law enforcement agencies as part of its investigation, 114 denied them. The justifications for such denials varied, but included arguments that the documents contained &quot;trade secrets&quot; or that the cost of complying with the request would be prohibitive. Communities have a right to know how the police do their jobs, but more often than not, police departments think otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being the Police Means Never Having to Say You're Sorry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Report by report, evidence is mounting that America's militarized police are a threat to public safety. But in a country where the cops increasingly look upon themselves as soldiers doing battle day in, day out, there's no need for public accountability or even an apology when things go grievously wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If community policing rests on mutual trust between the police and the people, militarized policing operates on the assumption of &quot;officer safety&quot; at all costs and contempt for anyone who sees things differently. The result is an &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just ask the parents of Bou Bou Phonesavanh. Around 3:00 a.m. on May 28th, the Habersham County Special Response Team conducted a no-knock raid at a relative's home near Cornelia, Georgia, where the family was staying. The officers were looking for the homeowner's son, whom they suspected of selling $50 worth of drugs to a confidential informant. As it happened, he no longer lived there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite evidence that children were present -- a minivan in the driveway, children's toys littering the yard, and a Pack 'n Play next to the door -- a SWAT officer tossed a &quot;flashbang&quot; grenade into the home. It landed in 19-month-old Bou Bou's crib and exploded, critically wounding the toddler. When his distraught mother tried to reach him, officers screamed at her to sit down and shut up, telling her that her child was fine and had just lost a tooth. In fact, his nose was hanging off his face, his body had been severely burned, and he had a hole in his chest. Rushed to the hospital, Bou Bou had to be put into a medically induced coma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police claimed that it was all a mistake and that there had been no evidence children were present. &quot;There was no malicious act performed,&quot; Habersham County Sheriff Joey Terrell told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. &quot;It was a terrible accident that was never supposed to happen.&quot; The Phonesavanhs have yet to receive an apology from the sheriff's office. &quot;Nothing. Nothing for our son. No card. No balloon. Not a phone call. Not anything,&quot; Bou Bou's mother, Alecia Phonesavanh, told CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, Tampa Bay Police Chief Jane Castor continues to insist that Jay Westcott's death in the militarized raid on his house was his own fault. &quot;Mr. Westcott lost his life because he aimed a loaded firearm at police officers. You can take the entire marijuana issue out of the picture,&quot; Castor said. &quot;If there's an indication that there is armed trafficking going on -- someone selling narcotics while they are armed or have the ability to use a firearm -- then the tactical response team will do the initial entry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her defense of the SWAT raid, Castor simply dismissed any responsibility for Westcott's death. &quot;They did everything they could to serve this warrant in a safe manner,&quot; she wrote the Tampa Bay Times -- &quot;everything,&quot; that is, but find an alternative to storming the home of a man they knew feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost half of all American households report having a gun, as the ACLU notes in its report. That means the police always have a ready-made excuse for using SWAT teams to execute warrants when less confrontational and less violent alternatives exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, if police believe you're selling drugs, beware. Suspicion is all they need to turn your world upside down. And if they're wrong, don't worry; the intent couldn't have been better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voices in the Wilderness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The militarization of the police shouldn't be surprising. As Hubert Williams, a former police director of Newark, New Jersey, and Patrick V. Murphy, former commissioner of the New York City Police Department, put it nearly 25 years ago, police are &quot;barometers of the society in which they operate.&quot; In post-9/11 America, that means police forces imbued with the &quot;hooah&quot; mentality of soldiers and acting as if they are fighting an insurgency in their own backyard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the pace of police militarization has quickened, there has at least been some pushback from current and former police officials who see the trend for what it is: the destruction of community policing. In Spokane, Washington, Councilman Mike Fagan, a former police detective, is pushing back against police officers wearing BDUs, calling the get-up &quot;intimidating&quot; to citizens. In Utah, the legislature passed a bill requiring probable cause before police could execute a no-knock raid. Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank has been a vocal critic of militarization,telling the local paper, &quot;We're not the military. Nor should we look like an invading force coming in.&quot; Just recently, Chief Charlie Beck of the Los Angeles Police Department agreed with the ACLU and the Los Angeles Times editorial board that &quot;the lines between municipal law enforcement and the U.S. military cannot be blurred.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retired Seattle police chief Norm Stamper has also become an outspoken critic of militarizing police forces, noting &quot;most of what police are called upon to do, day in and day out, requires patience, diplomacy, and interpersonal skills.&quot; In other words, community policing. Stamper is the chief who green-lighted a militarized response to World Trade Organization protests in his city in 1999 (&quot;The Battle in Seattle&quot;). It's a decision he would like to take back. &quot;My support for a militaristic solution caused all hell to break loose,&quot; he wrote in the Nation. &quot;Rocks, bottles and newspaper racks went flying. Windows were smashed, stores were looted, fires lighted; and more gas filled the streets, with some cops clearly overreacting, escalating and prolonging the conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These former policemen and law enforcement officials understand that police officers shouldn't be breaking down any citizen's door at 3 a.m. armed with AR-15s and flashbang grenades in search of a small amount of drugs, while an MRAP idles in the driveway. The anti-militarists, however, are in the minority right now. And until that changes, violent paramilitary police raids will continue to break down the doors of nearly 1,000 American households a week.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Heritage Foundation has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., today blasted &quot;big government&quot; in response to the current situation in Ferguson, Mo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an op-ed published in Time, Paul wrote, &quot;Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem.&quot; He continued:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies--where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking about the photos and footage coming out of Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis, Paul wrote that they &quot;resemble war more than traditional police action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kentucky senator, however, also sounded a cautious note about the protests in Ferguson, writing, &quot;The outrage in Ferguson is understandable--though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace,&quot; Paul added, &quot;but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been protests in Ferguson since the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was killed in an interaction with a police officer Saturday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">492  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US Department of Justice, The Government of USA has issued the following news release: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement Thursday following his meeting earlier today with President Obama to discuss the latest developments in Ferguson, Missouri: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, I met with President Obama to discuss the events in Ferguson, Missouri. Like the President, I extend my heartfelt condolences to the family of Michael Brown. While his death has understandably caused heartache within the community, it is clear that the scenes playing out in the streets of Ferguson over the last several nights cannot continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For one thing, while the vast majority of protests have been peaceful, acts of violence by members of the public cannot be condoned. Looting and willful efforts to antagonize law enforcement officers who are genuinely trying to protect the public do nothing to remember the young man who has died. Such conduct is unacceptable and must be unequivocally condemned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the same token, the law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them. Those who peacefully gather to express sympathy for the family of Michael Brown must have their rights respected at all times. And journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message. At my direction, Department officials have conveyed these concerns to local authorities. Also at my direction, the Department is offering - through our COPS office and Office of Justice Programs - technical assistance to local authorities in order to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force. The local authorities in Missouri have accepted this offer of assistance as of this afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Department officials from the Community Relations Service are also on the ground in Missouri to help convene law enforcement officials and civic and faith leaders to plot out steps to reduce tensions in the community. The latest such meeting was convened in Ferguson as recently as this morning. Over time, these conversations should consider the role that increased diversity in law enforcement can play in helping to build trust within communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the while, the federal civil rights investigation into the shooting incident itself continues, in parallel with the local investigation into state law violations. Our investigators from the Civil Rights Division and U.S. attorney's office in Missouri have already conducted interviews with eyewitnesses on the scene at the time of the shooting incident on Saturday. Our review will take time to conduct, but it will be thorough and fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
