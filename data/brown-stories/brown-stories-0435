<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Monday's police shooting here brings out demonstrators. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shannon Bonds said she thought it would be more peaceful when she moved to Los Angeles from Ferguson, Mo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-year-old singer said she left the city near St. Louis because she wanted to live in a more diverse area and get away from harassment from police for being black. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she heard that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 18, was shot to death by police in her hometown over the weekend, she said she was sad but unsurprised. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Monday, Ezell Ford, 24, was identified by family members as the man fatally shot after being stopped on a sidewalk by two Los Angeles Police Department officers near 65th Street and Broadway. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Brown and Ford were unarmed. Ford has been described as mentally disabled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford's death has sparked anger over differing accounts given by police and his family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been watching this kind of news on TV for days and it's eating me alive,&quot; Bonds said. &quot;We're here because we're tired of being targeted. We try to not think this is about race, but it's so frequent with us that it's just how it looks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As demonstrators took to the streets in Ferguson to voice their anger at police, on Thursday hundreds did the same at Leimert Plaza Park in South Los Angeles to honor Ford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And across the country, thousands of people in more than 90 cites took part in protest vigils for Brown as part of a National Moment of Silence Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Los Angeles march was more peaceful that what had ensued in Missouri. They marched from the park down Crenshaw Boulevard for about five blocks with their hands raised, as if surrendering, many shouting &quot;Don't shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many, representing civil rights groups, said they'd had enough. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an emergency protest,&quot; said protest organizer Keith James, a member of a grassroots group called Stop Mass Incarceration Network. &quot;This is to shine a spotlight on the egregious murder of Ezell and others like him who are young and supposed to be the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford was walking on the sidewalk at around 8:10 p.m. Monday when two officers conducted an &quot;investigative stop&quot; according to a police statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they attempted to speak to Ford, he &quot;continued walking and made suspicious movements, including attempting to conceal his hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials say a struggle ensued and Ford tried to grab an officer's gun at which point he was shot. Family members say Ford was on the ground and complying with officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the protest, many of the demonstrators arrived to the scene of the shooting on 65th Street near Broadway in the Florence neighborhood. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ezell's younger brother, Lavell Ford, 22, stood at a memorial set up on the sidewalk near the site of the struggle. It was filled with candles, flowers and stuffed animals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lavell Ford said he didn't expect the arrival of the group of demonstrators but added he was grateful for their presence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My family appreciates the support,&quot; he said. &quot;We really do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few remaining protestors made their way to the LAPD 77th Street station. Some said they hoped police would listen to them and take responsibility for Ezell Ford's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonds, who thought she was escaping the &quot;senseless&quot; killings in Ferguson, said she's disappointed that her new home in Los Angeles doesn't feel so different from what she left in the Midwest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's just sad,&quot; she said. &quot;Every day, you have to pray that it's not my little brother or cousin or me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
