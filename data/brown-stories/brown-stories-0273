<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama promised a full investigation by the US department of justice into the teenager's death. &quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but . . . I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
