<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of the fatal shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, St. Louis faith leaders are hoping to lead the charge in de-escalating racial tension and rebuilding trust in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One step toward that goal will take place tonight, when the Rev. Traci D. Blackmon will host a forum at 7 p.m. at Christ the King United Church of Christ. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson and Mayor James Knowles III are expected to be on hand to answer questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blackmon, pastor at Christ the King in Florissant, is organizing the forum after submitting a petition with about 480 signatures to the Ferguson Police Department that called on officers to immediately engage with the community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what is at the core of this is fear,&quot; said Blackmon, adding that she was not ready to vilify the Ferguson Police Department. &quot;What an African-American male represents is fear, and our fear causes us to react irrationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes there's justified fear on both sides, but how do we stop it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blackmon said she had been in contact with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family, praying twice with Michael's mother, Lesley McSpadden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blackmon hopes that, in addition to civic and faith leaders, those who feel most disenfranchised in Ferguson will attend the forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hear people saying, 'See me, hear me, I'm not invisible,'&quot; Blackmon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a small group of individuals that tend to take advantage of the situation and make it worse,&quot; Blackmon said, referring to Sunday's night looting in Ferguson. &quot;We want to go in a positive direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rodney Francis, senior pastor at Washington Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church, said the &quot;main concern is how we can prevent interactions with unarmed citizens from ending with a homicide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to know what kind of training officers are being given to de-escalate,&quot; a situation, Francis said. Police need to &quot;respect that everyone in the community is not a criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A range of church leaders are expected to attend Tuesday's forum, including representatives from the St. Louis Metropolitan Clergy Coalition, the United Church of Christ, Central Reform Congregation and the Rev. Michael Kinman of Christ Church Cathedral, an Episcopal church in St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sermon on Sunday, Kinman spoke about the death of Brown, noting that although some of the facts of the case were unknown, the community realizes there are &quot;too many guns on our streets... that there are deep divides of race and class... that these divides continue to bring us nothing but misery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Show us that this storm, of whom </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is only the latest victim, is not more powerful than God and God's people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were born to walk on water. We can do impossible things,&quot; Kinman said to his congregation, referring to Jesus walking on water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By today, the Rev. Al Sharpton, a New York-based civil rights leader, is also expected to arrive in St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said, at the request of the Brown family, he was flying to St. Louis to &quot;work with groups in the area as we pursue justice in the tradition of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Anderson, president of 100 Black Men of Metropolitan St. Louis, a nonprofit group that aims to educate and empower young African-Americans, said church leaders have always played an important role in leading a community out of civil unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;History tells us the church has been at the forefront of moving social issues forward,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;We do believe prayer is a piece of change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson said the forum would attempt to sort out the frustration in the African-American community that has been building for years but over the weekend was released &quot;like a bottle cork that just busted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
