<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLICE SAID an unarmed 18-year-old black man shot by an officer in a St. Louis suburb Saturday was part of a duo that instigated the violent and fatal confrontation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters in a brief news conference Sunday, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said that an officer encountered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and another individual Saturday afternoon in front of an apartment complex in Ferguson, a predominately black suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the unnamed officer exited his squad car, one of the men pushed the officer back inside, where a struggle ensued over the officer's weapon, Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least one shot was fired in the car, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After exiting the car, the officer fatally shot Brown, striking him &quot;more than a couple&quot; times about 35 feet away from the car, Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities said they were still piecing together what happened inside the car. It's unclear whether it was Brown who struggled with the police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the shell casings at the scene matched bullets from the officer's gun, Belmar said, noting that Brown was not armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the second person with Brown has not been arrested or charged. Authorities aren't sure if that person was unarmed, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of hundred people protested outside the news conference, held at the local firehouse, chanting, &quot;Don't shoot!&quot; Some marched inside the adjacent police building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said Sunday that Attorney General Eric Holder had instructed lawyers in the department's Civil Rights Division to monitor developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Rev. Al Sharpton announced that he planned to visit the area at the request of Brown's family to ensure a fair investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's family continued to express disbelief at the killing of the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My grandson never even got into a fight,&quot; said grandmother Desiree Harris. &quot;He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local news reports said that Brown was a recent high school graduate who was due to start college classes Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My son just turned 18 and graduated high school, he didn't bother nobody,&quot; distraught mother Lesley McSpadden, furious at the police, told local news channel KSDK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar said the officer in the shooting, currently on standard administrative leave, had a clean record in his six years on the force.</SPAN></P>
