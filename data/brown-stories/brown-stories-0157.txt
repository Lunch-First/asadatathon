METRO passengers were left on trains and platforms as a power cut in Newcastle brought trains to a standstill.
The entire network ground to a halt as the system's South Gosforth control centre and hundreds of homes found themselves without electricity on Tuesday morning. 
A spokesman for Nexus said: "Due to a brief power cut in the Gosforth area of Newcastle, we were unable to fully monitor our signalling and radio systems.
"As a result, the trains were brought to a standstill for just over 15 minutes, until we were 100% satisfied we could operate safely.
"Trains are now running again, although not to timetable.
However, they should be along within the 12 or six minutes later than expected, as all trains stopped at the same time and the frequency is unaffected."
As well as the Metro system, businesses and streets in 119 postcodes in the Gosforth and Fawdon areas were left without power at around 8.55am.
Northern Powergrid said it was also dealing with incidents in the Coxlodge and Grange Park estates, as well as around Hollywood Avenue and Regent Centre.
It said the power cut was due to a fault on the electricity network supplying the area.
A spokesman for Northern Powergrid said that it is "allocating the job of restoring power to an engineer who will be shortly travelling to the area".
"Sorry for any inconvenience," he added.
Lorna Michaels Recruitment, based at Regent Centre, tweeted: "Powercut in Gosforth this morning affecting many businesses and residential properties. #badtimes."
The firm said power was back on in the area after about an hour.
