  The Rev. Al Sharpton is heading to the scene of another controversial death involving cops - this time in Missouri, where an unarmed teen was shot to death by a police officer.   
  Sharpton, who is set to lead a march in Staten Island later this month to protest the police chokehold death of Eric Garner, said he will travel to St. Louis, where 
 18, was killed. Police on Sunday said he was unarmed. 
  Sharpton said Brown's grandfather asked him to make sure there was a fair investigation and justice for the teen. 
  "I assured him the National Action Network will stand with the family," the civil-rights activist and talk-show host said. 
  The shooting occurred Saturday afternoon when an officer encountered two people on the street near an apartment complex in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said. One man pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began, he added. 
  It was not clear if Brown was the man who struggled with the officer. 
  At least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the car. The clash spilled out onto the street, and Brown was then shot multiple times. 
  Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Ferguson police headquarters on Sunday, some chanting, "Don't shoot me!"
