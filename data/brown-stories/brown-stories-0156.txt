TWILIGHT heart-throb Robert Pattinson has confessed he'd like a night out on the Toon - with the Geordie Shore cast.
Former vampire R-Patz is a massive fan of the Newcastle-set reality series, and has previously described it as "one of the greatest" TV shows ever. 
And speaking to MTV News ahead of the release of his new film Rover, the Harry Potter star said he'd love a night out with Charlotte, Vicky, Gaz and the gang.
"I love Geordie Shore!" he said. "They're all so happy all the time. I'd actually want to hang out with them.
"With most of those reality shows it's like watching a bunch of people who are just desperate for fame, and those guys just look like they'd just be doing the same thing anyway.
"They're really genuine."
However, Pattinson's Rover co-star Guy Pearce - best known for his performances in Iron Man 3, LA Confidential and as Mike in Neighbours - seemed a bit bemused by the whole Geordie Shore thing - but still said he'd be up for a night out with the raucous stars.
"I love Charlotte and her bed-wetting," he said. "Let's all go hang out with them."
Geordie Shore star Holly Hagan - who recently tried her hand at a pop career -has previously expressed her delight that R-Patz was a fan, telling Zoo Magazine: "Imagine me walking down the street and Robert Pattinson knowing who I am? "He's a proper celebrity with real talent and he thinks what we do is enjoyable. Mental!"
