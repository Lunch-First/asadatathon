<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States Army, The Government of USA has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fort Sill's Sgt. 1st Class Adrian Villareal, Senior Leaders Course (SLC) instructor, was one of seven Soldiers who became the first to receive the Army Instructor Badge during a recognition ceremony July 17 in Alexandria, Va.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for how this impacts the Army, Villareal said the badge recognizes instructors' efforts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the badge is a great thing to have because it lets us know and everyone else that instructors are on the same sheet of music as the drill sergeants and recruiters,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Army chief of staff, and sergeant major of the Army recognized the instructors for their participation in Training and Doctrine Command's (TRADOC) Instructor Development and Recognition Program (IDRP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of the program, designed by TRADOC's Institute for Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development, is to coach, mentor and train instructors who teach at noncommissioned officer academies throughout the Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our Soldiers are the best at what they do because of the training they receive from world-class instructors,&quot; said Command Sgt. Maj. Daniel Dailey, TRADOC CSM, and narrator for the IDRP ceremony. &quot;These first seven Army Instructor Badge recipients represent the thousands of dedicated professionals in our Army who teach, coach and mentor tomorrow's future leaders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ceremony served as a foundation on which the Army can promote instructor achievement through personal and professional growth, inspiring others to do the same, said Master Sgt. Elsi Inoa-Santos, IDRP manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This award codifies and recognizes hard work,&quot; said Sgt. 1st Class Brian Ditzler, an Army Instructor Badge recipient from the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Benning, Ga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ditzler has 16 years of service with two years as an instructor at the Henry Caro NCO Academy. He said the badge is more than the individual recognition; it symbolizes the team effort of developing the backbone of America's Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not just for me, but for my team and all the hard work they have put in to develop NCOs who come through the NCO academy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Villareal said he is proud to be an instructor and enjoys facilitating learning among senior enlisted Soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this job I have right here, I impact the Army more than in any other job I can think of. Back to the badge and why it's important, we're not just training privates, and we're not just people to be led. We're trying to send out leaders; if we're not doing that in a good way, then we could be setting up the Army for a loss. We have to be able to keep the information relevant and keep the students interested,&quot; said Villareal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said part of training the Army's leaders is showing them how to make a difference, not only in their units, but Armywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like to challenge these guys to find those regs and find something wrong with them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, a suggestion made in SLC was accepted and changed Army Regulation 350-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sending those leaders back now they know if they see something that's wrong they don't just complain about it. You've got to show your Soldiers, look you can make a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other five instructors to receive the badge were:<BR>-- Sgt. 1st Class </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quarter Master Corps, Fort Lee, Va.<BR>-- Sgt. 1st Class Kevin Johnson, Aviation Center of Excellence, Fort Eustis, Va.<BR>-- Staff Sgt.
