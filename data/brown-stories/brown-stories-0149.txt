THE SUBURBAN St. Louis police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teen is a marked man.
The Ferguson, Mo., police chief opted Tuesday not to release the cop's name after the department was deluged with death threats. 
"If we come out and say, 'It was this officer,' then he immediately becomes a target," said Chief Tom Jackson. "We're taking the threats seriously."
Jackson did not divulge details of the threats against the six-year veteran who shot 18-year-old 
 on Saturday - and who is now on paid administrative leave.
But the chief spoke out after Ferguson was rocked by another night of violent protests - and after some 100 demonstrators marched on the St. Louis County courthouse Tuesday chanting, "Hands up! Don't shoot!"
Witnesses have said Brown was holding his hands up in surrender when he was shot. And the Browns' family lawyer said the teen was shot up to eight times.
"He was executed in broad daylight," said Benjamin Crump.
President Obama offered condolences Tuesday and called for peace.
"I urge everyone in Ferguson, Mo., and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding," he said. "We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds."
While the Rev. Al Sharpton was in Ferguson meeting with Brown's parents, the FBI launched a civil rights investigation.
