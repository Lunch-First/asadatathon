NIGHTS of unrest have vied with calls for calm in a St Louis suburb where an unarmed black teenager was killed by police. 
Meanwhile the community was still pressing for answers about the weekend shooting.
Hundreds of residents packed two churches yesterday for community meetings about the death of 18-yearold 
 who was confronted by a Ferguson officer while walking with a friend in the street near his grandmother's home.
People also gathered in the streets last night, shouting at police. Officers reportedly fired tear gas into a crowd.
One person was hurt in a drive-by shooting, although it was not clear if the it was related to the protests. There were also reports a St Louis County police officer shot and critically wounded a man who authorities said pulled a handgun on the officer.
The fatal shooting of Mr Brown has exposed deep racial and economic fault lines in the community.
