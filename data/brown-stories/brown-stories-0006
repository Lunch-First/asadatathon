<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PORT Vale keeper Sam Johnson says he can't afford any slip ups after  he was picked ahead of Chris Neal for the 1-1 draw with Walsall. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 21-year-old Johnson and 28-year-old Neal had shared goalkeeping duties during pre-season, but the younger man discovered he had won the battle for the start of the campaign when manager Micky Adams read out Vale's team just after 1.30pm on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Johnson went on to have a solid game against Walsall, but says he has to keep improving to hold off the challenge of Neal, who  won the players' player award for last season before signing a new two-year contract in the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said: &quot;Chris is such a fantastic goalkeeper and I thought, with all his experience, that he was a shoo-in for the first game, but thankfully it was me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know Chris is going to want the shirt back, so I have to keep pushing myself, and I am sure he will keep pushing me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are good friends off the pitch, so he wished me good luck before the match and told me to keep doing what I have been doing.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson had little chance with Tom Bradshaw's 59th-minute equaliser for the Saddlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams picked Johnson because of his form in pre-season, but must now decide whether to stick with the May Bank goalkeeper for tomorrow night's Capital One game at home to Hartlepool, or use the tie to give Neal a run out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manager will also step up his search for a striker today after saying that is the one position where his squad is still short of numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson believes the squad have a good chance of building on last season's ninth-placed finish in League One, the club's highest finish in the Football League for a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained: &quot;We have experience all over the team. Even the likes of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have so much experience, but he just missed out in this game. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there is a belief in the side that we can do what we did last season and finish in the top half. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some other teams have quite big budgets, but I think it is our self belief that is going to get us forward.&quot; </SPAN></P>
