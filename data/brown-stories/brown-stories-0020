<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. The FBI said Monday it has opened an inquiry into the weekend shooting death of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer that sparked a night of looting and vandalism in this suburb of St. Louis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special Agent Cheryl Mimura, of the FBI's office in St. Louis, said the agency had begun an investigation into possible civil rights violations connected to the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances of Brown's death remained in sharp dispute two days after he was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 northwest of St. Louis. Police have said an officer, who has not been identified, was &quot;physically assaulted&quot; before opening fire early Saturday afternoon. Authorities also said there had been a struggle &quot;over the officer's weapon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics have questioned the police's account and demanded that the officer face prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Chief Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County Police said an autopsy had shown that Brown had been &quot;struck several times by gunfire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar's agency has been leading the investigation, and Mimura said the county police would continue their work as the FBI conducted its review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference Monday, Belmar pleaded for the public's patience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand that the public has a right to be skeptical, and I appreciate that and I would expect that the public be skeptical oftentimes of government or some forms of it,&quot; he said. &quot;But I would also ask the public to be reasonable because it takes a long time to make sure we do this investigation the right way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, a Justice Department spokeswoman, Dena Iverson, said Monday that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had instructed lawyers in the Civil Rights Division to monitor developments in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials on Monday were also absorbing the consequences of what they said was an unprecedented night of chaos for Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been doing this 28 years,&quot; the chief said. &quot;Not only have I never seen anything like this, I've never even heard about it in the history of St. Louis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A vigil Sunday for Brown was followed by angry demonstrations overnight after protesters took to the streets, looting stores, vandalizing cars and confronting police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the county police, said 32 people were arrested. He also said two police officers were injured, including one who was struck by a brick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People smashed car windows and carried away armloads of looted goods from stores Sunday night after thousands of people packed a suburban St. Louis area at a vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people looted a convenience store. Several other stores along a main road near the shooting scene were broken into and looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People were seen carrying bags of food and toilet paper. TV footage showed streams of people walking out of a liquor store carrying bottles of alcohol, and in some cases protesters were standing atop police cars or taunting officers who stood stoic, often in riot gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other witnesses reported seeing people vandalize police cars and kick in windows. Television footage showed windows busted out of a TV station van.</SPAN></P>
