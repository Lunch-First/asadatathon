Police say they have tracked missing brothers Remus, Janko and David Matloch as far as Newcastle Central Station - but then the trail goes cold. 
The three boys left their home left their home in Sunderland at around 5.20pm on Monday, heading out their bikes to the city's Mowbray Park.
Instead of stopping there officers have found CCTV which shows the boys rode on to the nearby Park Lane Metro Station and travelled to Newcastle, leaving the station in the direction of the Centre for Life - then disappearing.
Police press conference on missing Sunderland brothers
Supt Alan Veitch of Northumbria Police's Sunderland Area Command has now appealed for anyone who may have seen the youngsters travelling on the Metro or after they left the station to help find the youngsters.
"We don't know if they travelled onward by rail, or if they came into Newcastle, or used another form of transport to go elsewhere," he said.
"So far we believe they may have been travelling to the railway station for a purpose to meet with a friend or family member.
"We would ask if anyone knows the boy's whereabouts we would ask them to contact police straightaway. We need to know where the boys are and that they are safe."
Police have issued descriptions and photos of the three boys in the hope it will jog peoples memories.
Anyone with information should contact Northumbria Police on 101, extension 69191, quoting log number 1276 of 11/08/14.
