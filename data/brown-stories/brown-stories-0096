<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DELLWOOD o Ferguson-area businesses grappled Monday with the aftermath of weekend looting that left windows shattered and store shelves empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence started Sunday evening in response to the fatal police shooting of 18-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the time it ended early Monday, more than two dozen businesses in Ferguson and neighboring Dellwood were damaged or looted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday found near bumper-to-bumper traffic up and down the ravaged stretch of West Florissant Avenue, where many businesses - even those untouched by violence - remained closed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those striving to put things in order was Zisser Tire &amp; Auto, where workers spent the day installing plywood over the shattered remains of massive glass panels that once bordered the showroom on three sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owner John Zisser, who hopes to be open again today, said looters nabbed display wheels and tires along with a customer's car. They would have taken more - after breaking into a warehouse in back - but police showed up in time to stop them, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zisser, who learned about the break-in while watching TV coverage Sunday night, was left shaken by the events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't understand,&quot; Zisser said. &quot;We've never had black-white issues here in the store.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quick survey of the damaged businesses suggests a pattern focused on auto parts suppliers, cellular phone stores, payday loan offices, beauty shops and larger retailers such as Walmart, Family Dollar and Toys R Us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, not every business fit that pattern. Outliers included a Taco Bell, a barbecue restaurant and, oddly, St. Vincent de Paul's Thrift Store, at 10052 West Florissant Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manager Bill Andre arrived early Monday morning to find that a brick was used to shatter the store's front door. But that was the extent of the damage, with the looters apparently deciding to move on without taking anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're curious what their thought process was,&quot; Andre said. &quot;But who wants used clothing when you can take new shoes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andre said the thrift store decided to open for business Monday with a skeleton crew, after a couple of employees expressed worries about working. He planned to close early, concerned that new violence could erupt later in the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The southern end of the rioting centered around the QuikTrip at 9420 West Florissant Avenue. The burned-out shell of a convenience store was a focal point for fresh, though quieter, demonstrations Monday. A few dozen protesters were camped out on the graffiti-marred site throughout the day, waving signs and receiving encouragement from passing cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QuikTrip spokesman Mike Thornbrugh said it's too soon to say what the company will do with that location. &quot;We haven't even discussed it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said employees who worked at that store will be offered transfers to other stores in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company also has temporarily closed another of its stores, farther north on West Florissant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The largest targets of the mob were found on the northern end of the crime spree, where Walmart and Toys R Us both remained closed Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Toys R Us spokeswoman said cleanup is underway. &quot;At this time, we do not know when we will be ready to reopen,&quot; Kathleen Waugh said in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Walmart spokesman also offered no timetable for that store's return to business, saying the company is still assessing the damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're still learning about what happened last night. But it's safe to say it was significant,&quot; said Brian Nick, of the chain based in Bentonville, Ark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, he said employees would still be working at the store to help get it ready for its reopening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The associates will still be doing work. It will just be a different kind of work,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most of the damaged stores were located along the West Florissant corridor - stretching just north of I-270 - the looting also extended east hitting the shopping center, anchored by the Home Depot, at New Halls Ferry Road and I-270.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, it was unclear whether the home improvement store was hit, but several nearby businesses, including Nu Fashion Beauty, Party City and Boost Mobile, were boarded up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that so many businesses lost windows during the rioting created a small business boom, of sorts, for companies such as AM Richards Glass Co., which had five trucks working the area throughout the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's crazy. I've never seen anything like it,&quot; said Steve Crandall, whose family owns the company. &quot;It's not something you'd expect from a small suburb of St. Louis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crandall said it would likely take a month or so before all the riot-ruined windows are replaced. That, he said, is based on his experience in dealing with insurance companies in other instances of large-scale damage - like when intense storms, or tornadoes, come through the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks just like a storm blew through here. A storm of people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
