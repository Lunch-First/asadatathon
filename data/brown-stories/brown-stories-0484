The shooting of 18-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has sparked outrage in his Missouri hometown, across the nation, and worldwide. In the wake of contention between local law enforcement and protesters, President Obama said &quot;now is the time of healing, now is the time for peace on the streets of Ferguson,&quot; at a press conference in Martha's Vineyard. According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) received a standing ovation when &quot;she told the crowd the county should 'demilitarize the police response' in Ferguson.&quot; Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) also called for the demilitarization of the police force in an op-ed for Time. In it, Senator Paul wrote that &quot;there is a systemic problem with today's law enforcement.&quot; [NPR] </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All We Do Is Eat, Eat, Eat No Matter What. If you didn't Instagram your meal, did you really eat it? A study by Piper Jaffray found that young people spend more money on food than any other commodity, and nothing captures our carefully crafted eating habits like Instagram. What's the best meal to photograph according to Millennials? Brunch. Cornell University student Mike Loffredo told USA Today College, &quot;People Instagram and share photos of creative dishes. They want others to see something that goes beyond ordinary brunch,&quot; adding, &quot;I think it might incentivize the food services industry to think outside the box.
