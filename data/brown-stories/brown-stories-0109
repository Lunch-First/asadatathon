<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MICKY Adams said Ben Williamson's 10-minute hat-trick will send the striker's confidence sky high after he helped Port Vale into the second round of the Capital One Cup with a 6-2 win at home to Hartlepool last night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The win was Vale's biggest ever in the League Cup, while Williamson's hat-trick, scored between eight and 18 minutes, is believed to be the fastest for the Valiants since Fred Mitcheson scored three in three minutes in 1934.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams was delighted the 25-year-old had netted the first  hat-trick of his career.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manager said: &quot;You shouldn't underestimate that as a feat.  I am delighted for him, I am always pleased when I see a centre-forward score goals because if they don't score they think they are not contributing to the team. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we all know with Ben's performances that there are other aspects to his game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is the one that goes over the top and stretches defences.  He has got three good goals and that will do him the world of good.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vale's win was wrapped up by a first goal for the club by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and two from Tom Pope to add to the goal he scored in Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Walsall.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keeper Sam Johnson was beaten from long range for Hartlepool's first goal, which levelled the scores at 1-1, but redeemed himself with several saves in an open second half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams said the 21-year old will keep his place for Saturday's League One trip to Doncaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manager added: &quot;There are aspects to Sam's game that he needs to improve on, but he is a young goalkeeper.  Was I the finished article at 21? No I wasn't, but I had to learn quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sam will be disappointed with the goal, but I don't think I should be making changes just because of one goal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
