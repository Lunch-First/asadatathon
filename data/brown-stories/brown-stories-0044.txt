 St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar said an officer encountered two people on the street near an apartment complex Saturday afternoon in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few kilometres north of downtown St. Louis. Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his car. The struggle spilled out into the street, where one man was shot multiple times. Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said the man who was shot was unarmed.
