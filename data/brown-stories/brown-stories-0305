<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hip-hop headliners Wiz Khalifa and Jeezy performed Tuesday night on the &quot;Under the Influence of Music&quot; tour at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater, but it was thoughts of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that stole the spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager, shot Saturday afternoon by a Ferguson police officer, factored into the sets by both Pittsburgh native Khalifa and Atlanta native Jeezy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeezy, whose black T-shirt read &quot;R.I.P. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; addressed the tragedy before dedicating &quot;Soul Survivor&quot; to the 18-year-old. He said he had a couple of things on his mind, and he knew the crowd, which numbered more than 9,000, did as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wanna talk to you about dreams,&quot; Jeezy said. &quot;If your dreams don't scare you, you aren't dreaming big enough. Do I got any big dreamers in the house? I wanna dedicate this to a big dreamer. His dreams were taken away from him. We (are going to) dream for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khalifa wore a white T-shirt with the words &quot;Don't Shoot&quot; across the front and &quot;R.I.P. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; on the back. He said &quot;Under the Influence of Music&quot; was more than just a tour; it was an experience meant to bring out everyone's peace and love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khalifa's set began with the impossibly lanky rapper rising from beneath the stage for &quot;Work Hard, Play Hard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backed by a small but noisy band, DJ and arena-size production, Khalifa gave a rock-star performance that cemented his status as one of the best of the rising young rappers. Songs such as &quot;Black and Yellow,&quot; &quot;Young, Wild and Free,&quot; &quot;Raw,&quot; &quot;Like Jimmy,&quot; &quot;No Limit&quot; and &quot;Medicated&quot; showcased a performer who could be as laid-back as he was explosive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes Khalifa stood perfectly still at the microphone on &quot;Stayin Out All Night,&quot; from his new album &quot;Blacc Hollywood,&quot; when he rose high above the stage on a podium. Other times he flailed about wildly. He crowd-surfed on &quot;We Dem Boyz,&quot; to the delight of fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a brief interlude, he paid homage to Snoop Dogg; the two are equally open about their use of marijuana. He may or may not have been smoking the substance onstage by that point in the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Damn It Feels Good to Be a Taylor&quot; and &quot;Taylor Gang&quot; brought out members of his Taylor Gang Records, including rapper Ty Dolla $ign, a support act on the bill, to party with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeezy, a St. Louis favorite, was accompanied by triumphant horn-filled music for his brand of street rap including &quot;Put On,&quot; &quot;SupaFreak,&quot; &quot;Trap Star (She Likes It),&quot; &quot;Go Crazy&quot; and &quot;I Luv It.&quot; He performed with a band and DJ as well, and brought out support act Rich Homie Quan to perform a YG song that features both of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also supporting Tuesday night, in addition to Quan and $ign, were IAMSU/Sage and Mack Wilds. DJ Drama spun during breaks in the fast-moving show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the concert, there had been some chatter over whether the rap concert should have been canceled or postponed for fear of a disturbance. The concert, on and off stage, went smoothly.</SPAN></P>
