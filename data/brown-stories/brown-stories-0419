<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">@BT New Screen/briefs Text - no indent;The UN said on Wednesday the death toll in Ukraine had soared with nearly 1,000 killed in two weeks, as Kiev signalled it could compromise on letting in Russian aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After earlier vowing to block a massive Russian convoy headed for its borders, Kiev said it could allow the aid to enter the country after it was inspected by Ukrainian border guards and foreign monitors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ukraine has raised fears the convoy of nearly 300 lorries could be a &quot;Trojan horse&quot; bringing military help to pro-Moscow insurgents who launched a rebellion in the country's east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions have risen as the convoy rumbled toward the border, with Western capitals fearing it could spark an escalation in a conflict that has already brought ties with Russia to their lowest point since the Cold War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the humanitarian crisis in the east worsened, President Petro Poroshenko's office suggested the much-needed aid could be allowed in to avoid what it called a &quot;large-scale invasion&quot; by Russia.</SPAN></P>
