<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days of unrest have convulsed Ferguson, Mo., after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 18, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by the police on Saturday. A peaceful vigil on Sunday was followed by rioting and looting that led to 32 arrests overnight. On Monday, scenes of unrest continued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters gathered on West Florissant Avenue, a commercial strip where much of the looting had occurred on Sunday night. A New York Times reporter, Julie Bosman, was on the scene. Instead of a notebook, she used Twitter to describe what she was seeing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were several hundred people, Ms. Bosman wrote. Traffic was backed up, and the police had arrived and formed a line, clad in riot gear. The protesters started yelling at the police, and the police drove them back into the surrounding residential neighborhood.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police were trying to prevent further looting, Ms. Bosman said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scene was chaotic. People were jumping on cars, though that was limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small number of people jumped on my car and threw a blood-like substance on the hood; then realized I wasn't police and apologized. -- Julie Bosman (@juliebosman) August 12, 2014</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the police started to set off tear gas. Ms. Bosman said she could see the gas billowing. People were running away as it stung their eyes and throats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scene in #Ferguson momentarily quieter. Residents covering their mouths with scarves and t-shirts to avoid gas. -- Julie Bosman (@juliebosman) August 12, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police then started shooting rubber bullets at people, including reporters and photographers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The standoff went on for several hours. The police were asking the crowd to disperse and go home, but most of the protesters did not live in the area, and the police were blocking their way out.</SPAN></P>
