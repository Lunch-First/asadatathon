<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON o The fatal shooting of a teen Saturday afternoon by a Ferguson police officer outside an apartment complex sent angry residents into the street, taunting police and firing shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 18, was shot at approximately 2:15 p.m. in the 2900 block of Canfield Drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother, Lesley McSpadden, said the shooting took place as her son was walking to his grandmother's residence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Piaget Crenshaw, 19, said she was waiting for a ride to work when she saw a police officer attempting to place Brown in the squad car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She then said she saw the teen, hands in the air, attempt to flee. Several shots hit Brown as he ran, Crenshaw said. She complied with a request that she give photos of the scene to authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown, a 2014 Normandy High School graduate, was scheduled to begin classes at Vatterott College on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting sparked a furious backlash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further shots were heard as police arrived immediately after the shooting but no one was injured as angry residents screamed obscenities mixed with threats to &quot;kill the police.&quot; More than 60 area police officers responded to the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louis Head, Brown's stepfather, held a sign that said: &quot;Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tension flared off and on through the evening. A calm settled over the area after mourners gathered at a prayer circle - watched over by a St. Louis County police officer sitting atop a SWAT vehicle - and then a candlelight vigil as darkness fell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acrimony briefly resurfaced about 8:30 p.m. as demonstrators again swarmed the street chanting, &quot;We Are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; as wary police officers stood nearby with assault rifles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, residents held up their hands, saying, &quot;Don't shoot me!&quot; as police officers with barking dogs tried to keep order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately 100 protesters then went to the street outside Ferguson police headquarters and chanted, &quot;No Justice! No Peace!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McSpadden appeared at the shooting scene sporadically, comforted by friends and neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know they killed my son,&quot; McSpadden was heard telling an acquaintance. &quot;This was wrong and it was cold-hearted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her son, she continued, &quot;doesn't kill, steal or rob. He doesn't do any of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said his department immediately turned the matter over to the St. Louis County police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He declined to comment on what had led to the shooting or any other details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are hoping for calm and for people to give us a chance to conduct a thorough investigation,&quot; Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County police spokesman Brian Schellman promised a &quot;lengthy investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're still trying to piece together what happened and why,&quot; Schellman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unnamed officer has been placed on paid administrative leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting sparked a furor on social media, with commenters expressing outrage over the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the afternoon wore on, activists, public figures and others arrived on the scene to urge calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, said she would petition the U.S. Justice Department on Monday for a formal investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis County NAACP is also asking that the FBI investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nasheed said she would additionally request that St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch look into what she termed the shooting of an &quot;unarmed citizen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III said the city was in mourning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a tragedy whenever a young person loses his life,&quot; the mayor said as he urged residents to remain calm and &quot;have faith in the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A protest rally is scheduled for Monday morning in front of the Ferguson police station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County police are to hold a press conference Sunday morning.</SPAN></P>
