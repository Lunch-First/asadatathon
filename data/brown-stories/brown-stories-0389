<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the family of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the 18-year-old unarmed African-American youth who was gunned down by a police officer in the state of Missouri last Saturday, grapple with his death, the incident has again initiated uncomfortable questions about the status and plight of African-Americans in US society. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's bereaved family are looking for answers. The police have confirmed that they too are looking for intentions that sparked this controversy. In doing so, they may have committed a procedural lapse, in the eyes of the public, by not naming the officer who shot the boy. This strengthens the racial argument for the residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By all accounts, the officer was white. The town of Ferguson, where the incident took place, has undergone a dramatic demographic shift from a majority of white residents to mostly black residents. The population of the town is two-thirds black. The local police force is made up of 53 officers, three of whom are black. Clearly, the question of inclusivity will raise its head. Brown was also unarmed -- another component in the problem that could cause the establishment to squirm while they try to come up with plausible arguments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial divisions have widened. The violence must stop. There must also be a quick and effective probe into the incident. More importantly, however, those who uphold the law must be seen to be doing and saying the right thing when dealing with such a sensitive issue.</SPAN></P>
