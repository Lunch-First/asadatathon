Vigils have been held across the country for people who died at the  hands of police.  
    People in more than 90 cities observed Thursday's National Moment  of Silence. The vigils came in the wake of the shooting death of an  18-year-old man by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., and the death  of a New York City man caused by a police officer's chokehold.   
  Rallies also were scheduled for the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, near  where 
 was shot, and in Detroit and Los Angeles.  People were asked to wear a red ribbon, cloth or bandanna in a show  of solidarity.  
    Hackensack native Yemisi Miller-Tonnet was one of several leaders  of the moment-of-silence event in Washington, D.C.,  
    "Having just four people show up to an event like this is just as  productive [as] having ...2,000 people," said Miller-Tonnet, 19.  "It's still just as powerful as long as we don't return home after  the moment of silence and do nothing else about it. We have to go  further with it."  
    In North Jersey, The Gardens at Wyckoff on Crescent Avenue was the  spot for a sparsely attended event.  
    "I live near here - you gotta start where you are," said Kenneth  Joseph of Mahwah. "People in this area are not typically affected  by police brutality -- they may not know what it means to think  that you're not going to be able to see your son off to college but  instead you are planning his funeral."  
    In New York, about a thousand people marched peacefully in  Manhattan's Union Square.  
    In Nevada, about 40 people gathered outside the federal courthouse  in Reno.
