</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLAYTON, Mo. -- Yet again, the protesters took to the sidewalks and streets, facing a row of police guarding the St. Louis County prosecutor's office. &quot;Hands up!&quot; they chanted, their arms aloft. &quot;Don't shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is how the boy died!&quot; Kendrick Strong, 42, hollered at police officers Tuesday morning. &quot;This is how the boy died! With his hands up in the air!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As St. Louis' predominantly black northern quarter has teetered toward chaos the past four days -- after police in the suburb of Ferguson killed an unarmed teen -- the chant has been one inescapable constant amid the worry and confusion and clamor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hands-up -- a sign of surrender and submission black men and boys here say they learn early on when dealing with police -- has been transformed into a different kind of weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're angry, throw your arms up,&quot; said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who traveled to St. Louis in the wake of the death of 18-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If you want justice, throw your arms up. Because that's the sign Michael was using. He had a surrender sign. That's the sign you have to deal with. Use the sign he last showed. We want answers why that last sign was not respected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was shot and killed by an officer Saturday, while Brown, according to witnesses, was running away with his hands up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police, an officer drove up next to Brown and attempted to get out of his patrol car. Brown pushed the officer back into the car and after an altercation over a weapon in the car, the officer and Brown exited the car, when the fatal shooting occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the days since the shooting, riot police have been sweeping the streets amid scenes of civil unrest. Stores have been looted, a gas station burned, a Catholic charity's window smashed. Teens have hurled rocks at cops. Officers have launched tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Brown's parents, has demanded that police identify the officer who shot Brown, but the Ferguson police chief declined to do so, citing death threats against the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama, noting the Justice Department is aiding local officials in investigating the shooting, on Tuesday said, &quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Mo., and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local and national black community organizations are deliberating their roles in how to respond to Brown's death. And everyone wonders when the convulsive nighttime violence that has turned Ferguson into an unpredictable &quot;war zone&quot; -- as some officers have put it -- will end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as &quot;Ferguson&quot; has transformed into an instantly recognizable shorthand -- a name now signifying an unsettled national conversation over race and policing -- the &quot;hands up, don't shoot&quot; chant has joined a long line of activist slogans that instantly crystallize the heart of a community's moral outrage: Hell no, we won't go. No justice, no peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators had already taken up the chant Monday when hundreds of demonstrators, many older, marched in front of the Ferguson Police Department, arms raised. About two-thirds of Ferguson's 21,000 residents are African-American, but police and city officials are predominantly white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black teens and 20-somethings who took to the streets in Ferguson on Monday night did the same, only their hands were raised to the lights of a police helicopter and the line of police vehicles -- with officers in front -- trying to keep them at bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the youths also used the hands-up sign as a tool for provocation, drifting toward the police with their arms up, as if daring for a response. They mixed the hands-up chant with a obscene anti-police chant. The police eventually drove them back with tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Clayton the following morning, the hands-up protest was deployed again to confront police officers, but with more peaceful intentions. For several black men who looked on as a line of demonstrators held up their hands, the symbol had powerful and even painful personal resonance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Sutton, 24, of St. Louis, recalled an incident when he was 18. He had gone to a mall with his little brother to pick out a prom suit, but ID-checkers at the entrance wouldn't let him in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sutton said that as he walked away with a cellphone to his ear, a police officer grabbed his hand; surprised, he yanked his arm away, and then was thrown to the ground, handcuffed and Tasered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That could have been me in '08,&quot; Sutton said of Brown's shooting. &quot;I wouldn't be here to tell this story. I wouldn't be here to protest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
