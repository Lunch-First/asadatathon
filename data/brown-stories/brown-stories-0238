<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,&quot; Mr Obama said in his first in-person remarks about the tense stand-off in the Missouri suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But let's remember that we're all part of one American family, we are united in common values and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama, speaking from the Massachusetts island where he is on a two-week holiday, said there was no excuse for excessive force by police in the aftermath of Saturday's shooting of 18-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had asked the Justice Department and FBI to investigate the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president said he had also spoken with Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, who has faced criticism for not doing more to control the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama defended the Democratic governor, calling him &quot;a good man, a fine governor&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have defended their use of tear gas and smoke bombs to repel protesters, saying they took those actions to disperse a large crowd after some people threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers.</SPAN></P>
