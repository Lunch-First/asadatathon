<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four-year-old Aubrey Glover struggled with a broom even taller than her to sweep broken glass in the parking lot of a burned-out convenience store the morning after a riot in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her mother, Erica Hampton, 31, woke up Aubrey and her brother, Jaden, 10, early Monday in their north St. Louis County home and said they were going to do some cleaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tearing up buildings and trashing places is not the way to solve anything,&quot; she told them. They brought large white trash bags and brooms. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She called her sister, Dede Patterson, 29, who lives near the street where 18-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was shot and killed by a police officer on Saturday. Patterson's young children have slept in the bed with her the past few nights while they heard shouts from the crowds outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't even explain it to them,&quot; Patterson said. She wasn't sure what to tell them. &quot;It was just too much.&quot; The QuikTrip is where her 9- and 7-year-old walk for snacks. &quot;My kids can't ever come to the store anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's go clean it up,&quot; her sister said to her. &quot;Let's go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patterson agreed: &quot;What I seen I didn't like. ... It's not going to bring him back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an urgency to do something, anything, to dull the terribleness of the past week. For Hampton, who will complete her master's degree in counseling in December, she wanted her children to see her picking up trash around the destroyed building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This what you do for your community,&quot; she told them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is anger here, not just about the shooting, but toward the vandals who destroyed their businesses in their neighborhood. Toward those who have changed the conversation from trying to find out what happened and seek justice to the criminal reaction of some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are judging us by this,&quot; Patterson said, waving her arms around the parking lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shamika Williams, 36, stood in the lot with two of her three daughters. They had seen Brown's body lying in the street in broad daylight when he was killed. Their mother has been at protests, wanting to add her voice to those calling for a change in the way residents are treated by law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want them growing up getting mistreated,&quot; Williams said. &quot;I don't want them growing up afraid of the cops. Why can't we protest? Why can't we grieve? Let us get this out of our system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stories she's heard and things she's seen make her glad she doesn't have a son. &quot;If I had a boy, I'd be afraid to let him walk the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond anger and grief, there is weariness in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many times have we seen this scene? How long will we march in streets?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems like this has been going on a while,&quot; said Kenyana Shaw, 25, of St. Louis. &quot;I can't imagine if this happened to my son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small child stood next to a young, black man speaking angrily to an older man in a parking lot. When I told him I wanted to speak to parents in the area, he became even more upset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He shook his head and started walking away from me but kept talking. He said he knew what it was like to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He said he knew how it felt to be stopped walking down these streets, automatically a suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was anguish in his voice: &quot;They hate us! Their daddies, their granddaddies hated us, and now they hate us!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman who owns a hair-braiding salon said she told her children to stay inside all day. She only came to check on her store and planned to lock up and stay home. Her older boys had been friends with Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm so scared,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were still parents pushing baby carriages down the debris-scattered street, past cracked and broken storefront windows, past graffiti that said &quot;kill the police&quot; and &quot;RIP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randy Casson, 37, stood in a small group with his 11-year-old son, who partially hid behind his father's legs. His son's eyes were sad. His face somber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casson tried to explain to him that the people who rioted had not learned a better way to express themselves. That they were angry and lashing out in the wrong way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems like the police and the people are about to go to war,&quot; Randy Jr. said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I couldn't help my immediate response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, baby, no. That's not going to happen. Why do you think that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard there are tanks coming down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not Gaza. This is not Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the heartland of America.</SPAN></P>
