</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The White House has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This afternoon, President Obama issued a statement on the death of 18-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who was fatally shot on Saturday by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time. As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as needed. I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that's what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric Holder also released a statement yesterday on the shooting, calling for a federal investigation to supplement the inquiry by local authorities:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shooting incident in Ferguson, Missouri this weekend deserves a fulsome review. In addition to the local investigation already underway, FBI agents from the St. Louis field office, working together with attorneys from the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and US Attorney's Office, have opened a concurrent, federal inquiry. The federal investigation will supplement, rather than supplant, the inquiry by local authorities. At every step, we will work with the local investigators, who should be prepared to complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right. I will continue to receive regular updates on this matter in the coming days. Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.</SPAN></P>
