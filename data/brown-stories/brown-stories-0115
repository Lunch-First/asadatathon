<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the 18-year-old shot dead Saturday night in an altercation with a police officer in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, had been eager to start college Monday, his mother said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wanted to be really good in visual arts and heating and cooling,&quot; Lesley McSpadden told USA TODAY. &quot;He was really good with his hands and taking things apart and putting them back together. He was almost like a healer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He fixed things. He didn't create problems. He fixed things. My son was sweet. He didn't mean any harm to anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sobbing McSpadden later spoke at a news conference Monday evening alongside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sr., the teen's father. Together, they pleaded for people not to riot or be violent and to reflect the peaceful nature of their dead child. &quot;He was a good boy,&quot; said Brown's father, who wore a shirt with his son's photo on it. &quot;He didn't deserve none of this. We need justice for our son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's parents asked anyone who witnessed the fatal shooting to come forward and speak to authorities. They also asked anyone with video or other recordings to turn that information over to federal investigators, the NAACP or Brown's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's family has retained attorney Benjamin Crump, best known as the attorney for the family of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teen shot and killed by George Zimmerman, a white neighborhood watch volunteer, in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump, who stood by the parents at the evening news conference, said too many unarmed young men of color have died at the hands of authorities or those acting as authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to sugarcoat it, their baby was executed in broad daylight,&quot; the attorney said of Brown. &quot;We want to know and see exactly what happened because this family rejects what the police authorities said at their press conference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McSpadden described her son as a sweet young man, a &quot;gentle giant.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
