Three foster brothers have gone missing after setting out for a bike ride to their local park.
Remus, Janko and David Matloch left their home at The Oaks in Sunderland at around 5.20pm on Monday night, heading for the city's Mowbray Park. 
The alarm was raised when they failed to return to their foster parents home by 8pm, then did not answer their mobile phones.
The three children have not gone missing before and a spokesman for Northumbria Police said officers are concerned for their welfare.
"The three boys are Polish, but speak good English, and had bicycles with them," she said.
"Remus, 15, is 5ft 7in tall, with a slim build, and dark coloured hair in a big quiff at the front and shaved at the back.
"He was last seen wearing jogging bottoms, a baseball cap and T-shirt, and a black cycling helmet.
"Janko, 12, is 4ft 8in tall, with fairer hair styled in a quiff and short at the back.
"He is of medium build and was last seen wearing smart mustard coloured chinos, Converse type trainers, a blue lightweight waterproof jacket with a white zip, and a silver cycling helmet
"David, 10, is 4ft 8in tall, with shaggy dark brown hair, a chubby build, and was possibly wearing shorts and a top, and a silver coloured cycling helmet."
Officers are appealing for the three brothers to make contact with them, or if anyone recognises them they should call police straightaway.
The boys have family members in Blyth and South Shields and police are asking anyone who knows where they are to call officers.
Anyone with information should contact police on 101, extension 69191, quoting log number 1276 of 11/08/14.
