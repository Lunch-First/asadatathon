MOMENTS AFTER an unarmed black teenager was killed by a suburban St. Louis cop, a county police dispatcher reported an urgent request from an officer in trouble.
"Need assistance with crowd control," the dispatcher said on recordings of radio chatter from Saturday - the day 18-year-old 
 was fatally shot. 
A short time time later, the dispatcher reported an "officer-involved shooting" in Ferguson, Mo., but added, "Be advised. This information came from the news."
"We called Ferguson back again and they don't know anything about it," she said.
Thirty minutes later, it was all hands on deck.
"Attention, all cars. Be advised we are switching over to the riot channel," the dispatcher said.
The apparent confusion was revealed in recordings obtained and posted on the Web Wednesday by Anonymous, a hacker collective that has launched "Operation Ferguson" to make sure that Brown's death is investigated.
It is also trying to unmask the officer who fired the fatal shots. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson has refused to identify the cop because of threats against his life.
The tapes were unveiled on the same day that Brown's pal Dorian Johnson, who claims the teen was "shot like an animal," finally met with police and FBI investigators.
His lawyer, former St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley, said he tried to arrange a meeting with police after the killing but was rebuffed.
Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St. Louis County police, insisted they tried several times to talk to Johnson but could not find him.
The Brown killing has stoked racial tensions in a mostly African-American suburb where there is deep resentment against a 53-person police force that has just three black officers.
Despite repeated calls for calm from people including President Obama, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Brown's family, Ferguson has been rocked by three straight nights of disturbances and looting.
