HARTLEPOOL had a Capital One Cup shocker at Port Vale as they crashed to a 6-2 defeat. Former Boro winger Jonathan Franks and Neil Austin (penalty) scored for Pools but they were overwhelmed at the back. Ben Williamson helped himself to a hat-trick for Vale before Hartlepool-born midfielder 
 scored and Tom Pope netted twice.
