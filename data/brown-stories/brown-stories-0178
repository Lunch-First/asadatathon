<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The F.B.I. may be able to answer the many questions surrounding the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an 18-year-old black student from Ferguson, Mo., who was a few days from heading off to college when he was shot by a police officer on Saturday. The shooting of Mr. Brown, who was unarmed, led to three days of protest, some of it violent, and several tense confrontations between residents of the St. Louis suburban town of 21,000 and the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it doesn't take a federal investigation to understand the history of racial segregation, economic inequality and overbearing law enforcement that produced so much of the tension now evident on the streets. St. Louis has long been one of the nation's most segregated metropolitan areas, and there remains a high wall between black residents -- who overwhelmingly have lower incomes -- and the white power structure that dominates City Councils and police departments like the ones in Ferguson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the late 1940s, blacks weren't allowed to live in most suburban St. Louis County towns, kept out by restrictive covenants that the Supreme Court prohibited in 1948. As whites began to flee the city for the county in the 1950s and '60s, they used exclusionary zoning tactics -- including large, single-family lot requirements that prohibited apartment buildings -- to prevent blacks from moving in. Within the city, poverty and unrest grew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the 1970s, many blacks started leaving the City of St. Louis as well. Colin Gordon, a professor at the University of Iowa who has carefully mapped the metropolitan area's residential history, said black families were attracted to older, inner-ring suburbs like Ferguson in the northern part of the county because they were built before restrictive zoning tactics and, therefore, allowed apartments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As black families moved into Ferguson, the whites fled. In 1980, the town was 85 percent white and 14 percent black; by 2010, it was 29 percent white and 69 percent black. But blacks did not gain political power as their numbers grew. The mayor and the police chief are white, as are five of the six City Council members. The school board consists of six white members and one Hispanic. As Mr. Gordon explains, many black residents, lacking the wealth to buy property, move from apartment to apartment and have not put down political roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disparity is most evident in the Ferguson Police Department, of which only three of 53 officers are black. The largely white force stops black residents far out of proportion to their population, according to statistics kept by the state attorney general. Blacks account for 86 percent of the traffic stops in the city, and 93 percent of the arrests after those stops. Similar problems exist around St. Louis County, where earlier this year the state chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. filed a federal civil rights complaint alleging widespread racial profiling by police departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances of Mr. Brown's death are, inevitably, in dispute. Witnesses said he was walking home from a convenience store when stopped by an officer for walking in the middle of the street, and they accused the officer of shooting him multiple times when his hands were raised over his head. The police said Mr. Brown had hit the officer. State and federal investigators are trying to sort out the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is not in dispute is the sense of permanent grievance held by many residents and shared in segregated urban areas around the country. Though nothing excuses violence and looting, it is clear that local governments have not dispensed justice equally. The death of Mr. Brown is ''heartbreaking,'' as President Obama said Tuesday, but it is also a reminder of a toxic racial legacy that still infects cities and suburbs across America.</SPAN></P>
