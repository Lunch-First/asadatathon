<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a rally in Decatur organized following the shooting of an unarmed black teen in Missouri, Chris Wilton recalled lessons from his grandmother. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember (her) telling me there's certain things I need to do to avoid getting killed by police,&quot; said Wilton, 25. &quot;I'm tired of seeing this on the news and it just passing over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 18, was shot to death Saturday by a Ferguson police officer. Nightly protests have followed in the St. Louis suburb, marked by incidents of civil unrest and what's being called a militaristic response by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday's rally in Decatur, organized through social media, included a moment of silence held at similar protests across the country. Police presence was minimal in Decatur and the crowd of about 200 remained peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there was no hiding the anger shared by many who attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police culture incites violence,&quot; said Inga Willis, 37, of southwest Atlanta. &quot;These things accumulate. They build, then they burst. That's what's happening in Ferguson. When faced with an impossible situation, all you can do is fight back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some, the shooting of Brown hit too close to home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a 16-year-old brother,&quot; said Latasha Kinnard, 26, of College Park, &quot;and I don't want to fear for him safely getting home at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't a black issue,&quot; she said. &quot;This is a social justice issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers say there will be more calls to action in the coming days. They're also seeking to raise money for the family of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to cover funeral expenses.</SPAN></P>
