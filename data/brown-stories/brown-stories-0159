<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BURTON boss Gary Rowett hailed his League Two team after Stuart Beavon's 52nd-minute winner knocked out Championship side Wigan 2-1. The on-loan Preston striker converted Lucas Akins' cross after substitute Dominic Knowles' 45th-minute strike cancelled out Marc-Antoine Fortune's opener. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is as well as any team of mine has ever played - ever,&quot; said Rowett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposite number Uwe Rosler was furious at the manner of the defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The second half was unacceptable,&quot; he said. &quot;We needed more than just three or four players to have a normal day.&quot; Ben Williamson scored a 10-minute hat-trick as Port Vale thumped Hartlepool 6-2. Williamson scored in the eighth, 14th and 18th minutes before being taken off in the 73rd minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hartlepool reduced the deficit through Jonathan Franks and a Neil Austin penalty, but Vale stretched their lead with a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strike and two from Tom Pope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dave Hockaday was made to sweat for a first win as Leeds manager as his side scraped a 2-1 victory over League Two Accrington. Souleymane Doukara scored two neat goals to put the hosts in a commanding position at half-time, but their standards slipped after the break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Beattie's Accrington gave themselves hope when James Gray pulled a goal back with six minutes left before Leeds had Gaetano Berardi sent off for a high tackle on Rob Atkinson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hockaday said: &quot;The first half showed little bits of what we're capable of, but the second half was a reality check.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nottingham Forest assistant manager Steve Wigley defended midfielder Michael Mancienne after his dismissal nearly sparked a Tranmere upset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mancienne was booked in the first half for blocking a quickly taken free-kick and then picked up a second yellow for a foul on Jason Koumas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was really disappointed with it,&quot; said Wigley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first one was a terrible decision as he couldn't really get out of the way. I have no complaints about the second one as his foot was up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forest led through Michail Antonio's 12th-minute header but were then forced to hang on with 10 men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">League Two Tranmere piled on the pressure and deserved to take the game to extra-time but Danny Woodards headed against the bar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boss Rob Edwards said: &quot;The game changed with the sending-off. His studs were high for the second one, so I think the referee was correct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
