<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWILIGHT heart-throb Robert Pattinson has confessed he'd like a night out on the Toon - with the Geordie Shore cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former vampire R-Patz is a massive fan of the Newcastle-set reality series, and has previously described it as &quot;one of the greatest&quot; TV shows ever. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And speaking to MTV News ahead of the release of his new film Rover, the Harry Potter star said he'd love a night out with Charlotte, Vicky, Gaz and the gang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love Geordie Shore!&quot; he said. &quot;They're all so happy all the time. I'd actually want to hang out with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With most of those reality shows it's like watching a bunch of people who are just desperate for fame, and those guys just look like they'd just be doing the same thing anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're really genuine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Pattinson's Rover co-star Guy Pearce - best known for his performances in Iron Man 3, LA Confidential and as Mike in Neighbours - seemed a bit bemused by the whole Geordie Shore thing - but still said he'd be up for a night out with the raucous stars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love Charlotte and her bed-wetting,&quot; he said. &quot;Let's all go hang out with them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geordie Shore star Holly Hagan - who recently tried her hand at a pop career -has previously expressed her delight that R-Patz was a fan, telling Zoo Magazine: &quot;Imagine me walking down the street and Robert Pattinson knowing who I am? &quot;He's a proper celebrity with real talent and he thinks what we do is enjoyable. Mental!&quot;</SPAN></P>
