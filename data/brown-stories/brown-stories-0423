<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Danny Lyon, one of the photographers whose work came to define the civil rights upheaval in the South in the 1960s, said he was struck on Thursday when he saw a news image from the racially torn suburb of Ferguson, Mo., showing four police officers arrayed in a phalanx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In part, it was because Mr. Lyon had taken a picture in 1963 in Birmingham, Ala., that looked very much like it: four officers standing in front of a police car with rifles and helmets, in a city where highly publicized clashes between protesters and the police helped turn the tide of public opinion toward the civil rights movement. But the image from Ferguson, for all its formal similarities, could not have been more different. Today's riot police officers were wearing military-style camouflage and carrying military-style rifles, their heads and faces obscured by black helmets and gas masks as they stood in front of an armored vehicle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It didn't look like America. It looked like Soweto,'' Mr. Lyon said, referring to the South African township that was a hotbed of protests against apartheid. ''It looked like soldiers. And soldiers' job isn't to protect. Their job is to kill people and to be ready to die.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photographs that have emerged during several days of unrest in Ferguson after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer have drawn mournful comparisons to pictures of the Deep South in the 1960s or of more recent racial unrest, like the 1992 Los Angeles riots. But they have also prompted a flood of commentary about the differences half a century has made in the visual economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have raised questions about whether photos have the same power now to sway public opinion and political will; about the increasingly sophisticated ways an image-saturated public reads a picture's racial and political subtext; and about the rapid transformation of the protests, even more so than the Los Angeles riots or the Occupy movement, into a war of images. The war pits what appears to be a large-scale paramilitary police presence against crowds of African-American protesters walking with their hands raised in surrender -- or people throwing things and looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Philadelphia Daily News was a case in point in the speed with which 21st-century image parsing can occur. In the wee hours of Thursday morning -- in response to readers' comments on Twitter about a photo the newspaper had planned to run on its front page, showing an African-American protester in Ferguson about to hurl what looked like a firebomb -- editors changed their minds and instead used a photograph of an African-American woman standing in front of police officers, holding a sign urging answers in the death of the teenager, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An assistant city editor wrote on Twitter to those objecting to the first picture that they would be able to understand the whole story, in a ''sympathetic treatment,'' if they opened the paper. But a reader responded, ''Yes, in ten-point font I can see the fine print, which is completely overwhelmed by the picture.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the civil rights era, the visual stamp of the movement was determined by newspapers and the nightly news. Today, the imagery one sees depends on the filters one uses. One person's Twitter feed may be full of footage of police firing tear gas or of peaceful protesters with their hands up. But David J. Garrow, a historian at the University of Pittsburgh's law school and the author of several books on the civil rights movement, noted that when he searched for images of Ferguson on Google, roughly half showed what appeared to be looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such images look ''more like Watts in 1965 or Newark in 1967, not Birmingham in 1963 or Selma in 1965,'' Dr. Garrow said. And historically, he said, such photos were ''deadly when it came to white public opinion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ferguson, the police seem to be just as worried about the dominance of certain imagery. The city's police chief, Thomas Jackson, said during a news conference Thursday that officials were meeting ''to talk about not only the tactics but the appearance'' of the police force, whose resemblance to American soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan has quickly become a social media theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some visual echoes of the 1960s, like the Ferguson police's use of dogs, may be unintentional. (During the 1963 March on Washington, President John F. Kennedy forbade the use of dogs for crowd control, knowing how badly it would play.) But on the protesters' side, there have been deliberate efforts to evoke the nonviolent protests of the civil rights era, like T-shirts with the slogan ''I Am a Man,'' borrowed from signs carried during the 1968 Memphis sanitation strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diane McWhorter, the author of ''Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama, the Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution,'' said she also saw echoes of those signs in the protesters' hands-up gesture, an instantly recognizable cue that seems to be both born of the quick-read Internet news cycle and able to shape it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In one case, it's a kind of mass witness of personhood,'' Ms. McWhorter said of the ''I Am a Man'' signs, ''and in the other case, a mass witness of innocence. Those images are very powerful.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some historians see dangers in those visual echoes. Martin A. Berger, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the author of ''Seeing Through Race: A Reinterpretation of Civil Rights Photography,'' said that while images of a protester throwing a firebomb or of the police spraying tear gas may start conversations, the historical associations can also distort public understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We can look at these pictures and say that Ferguson is the same as Los Angeles or Birmingham, because it looks the same,'' Dr. Berger said. ''But we have to ask not just, 'What is the same?' but also, 'What are the ways in which America has changed?' To just have another conversation that stops at the level of police brutality doesn't really get us very far.''</SPAN></P>
