WASHINGTON: Missouri police fired tear gas and smoke bombs late yesterday at protesters demonstrating over the killing of an unarmed black teenager by an officer.
CNN and other media reported that police officers in riot gear marched toward the protesters near a burnt-out petrol station where demonstrators had gathered in|Ferguson, a St Louis suburb. 
TV footage of the fifth straight day of unrest there showed thick clouds of smoke and protesters scurrying through it in the dark.
Police also used sonic devices that make a loud ear-splitting sound to try to disperse the crowd, the |St Louis Post-Dispatch reported.
Demonstrators taunted the police. "We're not dogs, so what the hell you've got those whipping sticks for? Because you want to whip us like dogs," one protester said, according to the newspaper.
Police separately arrested two journalists reporting on the unrest that has roiled Ferguson since aspiring college student 
 18, died on Saturday in a police shooting. His death has triggered rioting and stirred comparisons with the February 2012 fatal shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin.
Wesley Lowery, a Washington Post political reporter, and Ryan Reilly, a Huffington Post reporter, were arrested in a McDonald's restaurant after police entered the restaurant and ordered people to leave, the pair wrote on Twitter.
In a series of tweets, Lowery said they were given no explanation for their arrest other than "trespassing", and were not charged with any offences before being released.
Officials in Ferguson urged demonstrators to remain calm.
Mayor James Knowles called for "any groups wishing to assemble in prayer or in protest do so only during daylight".
US President Barack Obama appealed for calm after the "heartbreaking" incident, saying the FBI had opened a civil rights investigation into Brown's death. - Sapa-AFP
