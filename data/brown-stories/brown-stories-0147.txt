Wet 'n' Wild bosses have apologised to customers after it closed it's doors amid claims swimmers were suffering coughing and vomiting fits. 
The newly reopened attraction is currently under investigation by North Tyneside Council after youngsters reported feeling unwell on Friday.
But now waterpark chiefs have said sorry - blaming "technical problems" for the breathing difficulties and sickness suffered by customers.
"Wet 'n' Wild closed one hour early on Friday, August 8, as a result of technical problems we were experiencing," a spokesman for Wet 'n' Wild said.
"For the comfort of our staff and customers, we took the decision not to open on Saturday, August 9 to allow us to check all pool water and humidity levels.
"Following a thorough investigation we re-opened on Sunday, August 10.
"We apologise for any adverse symptoms or discomfort that may have been experienced by our customers".
Inside Wet 'n' Wild
The popular centre - which only re-opened on August 4 following a 1.1m refurbishment - saw families flock to visit in it's first week.
But after less than five days the waterpark was closed early, after problems with the "air quality."
One teenager said he had to rush out of the water to be sick six times after becoming ill at the attraction.
Johnathan Hastings, 16, from Blakelaw in Newcastle, said: "It was just horrible in there. It was so hot, I couldn't breathe and I had to keep running to the fire escape to be sick.
"Everyone was coughing, even the lifeguards. One of them told me it was because of the air conditioning."
The park is now back open but North Tyneside Council have said they are investigating what went wrong.
A spokeswoman for the local authority said: "We are aware of reports of breath and sickness problems at Wet'n'Wild.
"We can confirm that we are investigating."
