The police chief in a Missouri city where a police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager said yesterday that he is holding off on publicly identifying the officer because of death threats. Civil rights leader Al Sharpton, standing with the parents of 18-year-old 
 criticised the decision, saying the secrecy is fuelling mistrust of the police in Ferguson, a predominantly black city of about 21,000 residents where violent protests broke out after the shooting. Police have released few details, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Brown and another teenager to get out of the street. At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, police said. Witnesses have said that Brown had his hands raised when the officer approached with his weapon and fired repeatedly.
