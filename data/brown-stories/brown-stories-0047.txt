THE shooting of a black teenager by a police officer sent hundreds of residents onto the streets of a US city in a confrontation with police that lasted several hours.
They shouted obscenities and threats, such as "kill the police" but there were no injuries, during the incident in the predominantly black city of Ferguson, Missouri.
The teenager's grandmother, Desiree Harris, was expecting her grandson, 
 18, when he was shot near her home.
