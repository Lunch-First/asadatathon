<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">METRO passengers were left on trains and platforms as a power cut in Newcastle brought trains to a standstill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entire network ground to a halt as the system's South Gosforth control centre and hundreds of homes found themselves without electricity on Tuesday morning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Nexus said: &quot;Due to a brief power cut in the Gosforth area of Newcastle, we were unable to fully monitor our signalling and radio systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a result, the trains were brought to a standstill for just over 15 minutes, until we were 100% satisfied we could operate safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trains are now running again, although not to timetable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, they should be along within the 12 or six minutes later than expected, as all trains stopped at the same time and the frequency is unaffected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as the Metro system, businesses and streets in 119 postcodes in the Gosforth and Fawdon areas were left without power at around 8.55am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Powergrid said it was also dealing with incidents in the Coxlodge and Grange Park estates, as well as around Hollywood Avenue and Regent Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the power cut was due to a fault on the electricity network supplying the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Northern Powergrid said that it is &quot;allocating the job of restoring power to an engineer who will be shortly travelling to the area&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sorry for any inconvenience,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lorna Michaels Recruitment, based at Regent Centre, tweeted: &quot;Powercut in Gosforth this morning affecting many businesses and residential properties. #badtimes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm said power was back on in the area after about an hour.</SPAN></P>
