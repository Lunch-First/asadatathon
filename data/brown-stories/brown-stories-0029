<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Rev. Al Sharpton is heading to the scene of another controversial death involving cops - this time in Missouri, where an unarmed teen was shot to death by a police officer.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sharpton, who is set to lead a march in Staten Island later this month to protest the police chokehold death of Eric Garner, said he will travel to St. Louis, where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 18, was killed. Police on Sunday said he was unarmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sharpton said Brown's grandfather asked him to make sure there was a fair investigation and justice for the teen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I assured him the National Action Network will stand with the family,&quot; the civil-rights activist and talk-show host said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shooting occurred Saturday afternoon when an officer encountered two people on the street near an apartment complex in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said. One man pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began, he added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was not clear if Brown was the man who struggled with the officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the car. The clash spilled out onto the street, and Brown was then shot multiple times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Ferguson police headquarters on Sunday, some chanting, &quot;Don't shoot me!&quot; </SPAN></P>
