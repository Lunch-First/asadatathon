 Office of the House of Representative Barbara Lee, U.S Government has issued the following news release:
Congresswoman Lee released the following statement on the tragic death of 
 and the ensuing violence in Ferguson: 
"The death of 
 is a tragedy and I offer my heartfelt condolences to 
's family, friends and the entire Ferguson community.
The deaths of Oscar Grant, Trayvon Martin and 
 serve as sad examples of the senseless murders of young African American men. As the mother of two black men and the grandmother of two black boys, I know that prejudice is endemic in our institutions, in our society and in our nation.
I join my Congressional Black Caucus colleagues in calling for a full and independent Department of Justice investigation to determine the truth and ensure justice for 
 and his family. The Brown family and the Ferguson community have lost a son to senseless violence.
The violence and militarization in Ferguson is deeply disturbing. It saddens me to see the images and hear reports of police officers outfitted like soldiers, journalists detained and jailed, and violence in the streets.
The violence in Ferguson's streets needs to stop. I encourage all outraged by this tragedy to embrace Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s nonviolent dream.  We must push forward with the peaceful passion ignited by this tragedy to fight inequality and injustice.   
All Americans have a constitutional right to peacefully protest. Law enforcement officials have failed to protect and respect that fundamental right.
Action must be taken to restore peace and  ensure a full and transparent DOJ investigation."
