<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hundreds of people gathered Thursday night at LOVE Park for a moment of silence in response to the turmoil in Ferguson, Mo., that followed the shooting death by police of an unarmed black teen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protests have roiled the Midwestern community since Saturday's fatal shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 18. The confrontation between police and protesters intensified Wednesday night, and the police were widely criticized for displaying an intimidating militarized presence and using overly aggressive tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In contrast, Philadelphia police officers kept their distance from the peaceful assembly in Center City, which also included a march up the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't want people to feel boxed in and intimidated,&quot; said Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan, explaining the light police presence. About 10 officers on bicycles were ready behind a nearby 7-Eleven just in case trouble erupted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Synthia Pullum, 24, of North Philadelphia, carried a sign that read &quot;Mike Brown&quot; and &quot;We Remember You&quot; and had a picture of Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm just sick and tired of hearing the same story over and over again,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't want another rally. I don't want another walk. Change must come.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joyce Hall, 55, went to LOVE Park with two cousins to participate in the moment of silence. She held a sign that had a photograph of her brother, three grandsons, and three nephews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It read: &quot;Don't shoot our men and boys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It seems like every other week, every week, there's another added to the list,&quot; Hall said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said she tells her grandchildren when they see a police officer, &quot;put your hands up,&quot; and don't move. &quot;If your nose itches, don't scratch it. They can kill you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As upset as she was with the police, she also expressed anger at the looters who took advantage of the unrest in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They need to all go to jail,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
