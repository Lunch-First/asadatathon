<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON o The Internet crashed at City Hall here on Tuesday morning. Ferguson's website went dark. The phones died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City officials didn't say what happened - only that a flood of traffic aimed at the City Hall website &quot;just kept coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an international group of unnamed computer hackers had warned it would happen. In the hours after 18-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was shot and killed by a Ferguson police officer, the group, Anonymous, urged residents to the streets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the hackers vowed retribution if police harmed protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are watching you very closely,&quot; Anonymous' distinctive electronic voice rasped in a video posted Monday on Twitter. &quot;If you abuse, harass or harm the protesters in Ferguson we will take every Web-based asset of your departments and federal agencies offline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hackers would also, the video continued, begin publicly releasing police officers' personal information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early Tuesday morning, someone posted the home address and phone number of Jon Belmar, the relatively new chief of St. Louis County police. And that was just the beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ferguson protests have been informed, if not fueled, by a stream of moment-by-moment posts, largely on Twitter. Published instantaneously via cellphones by residents at the scene, the messages have told the world when crowds amass, when police line up, when tear gas flies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Anonymous hackers have reached beyond the Web.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anonymous has been operating for nearly a decade. It's hard to even call it a group - those insiders who have spoken publicly about the organization describe it more in terms of each individual mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is an anarchist collective of autonomous individuals,&quot; wrote one hacker who responded to an email from the Post-Dispatch. &quot;Most of us are friends and work together, but we are not responsible for anything anyone else in the global collective does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That team member, who declined to be identified but said he was out of the country, said the core Ferguson operation is run by about a half-dozen Anonymous operatives, invited by St. Louis activists, with thousands of &quot;Anons&quot; from about 75 different countries &quot;joining in to help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in the wee hours of Tuesday morning, at least one of those hackers began following standard Anonymous protocol: He began scouring the Internet for personal documents regarding Chief Belmar - &quot;doxxing&quot; - the man Anonymous estimated was keeping the shooter's name secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just after midnight, someone posting as @TheAnonMessage linked to a Web page listing Belmar's address, phone number and the names of his wife and kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 12:36 a.m., TheAnonMessage posted a photo of Belmar's house; at 12:41, his phone number and address, and at 12:46, another missive: &quot;... you said our threats were just hollow. See, that makes us mad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came the photos, all allegedly portraying his family: His son, asleep on a couch. His wife and daughter, arm-in-arm. He and his wife, together. &quot;Nice photo, Jon,&quot; TheAnonMessage added. &quot;Your wife actually looks good for her age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you had enough?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, at 1:34 p.m. on Tuesday, TheAnonMessage leveled an ultimatum: &quot;Jon Belmar, if you don't release the officer's name, we're releasing your daughter's info. You have one hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Anonymous gave up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We recognize that Jon Belmar has had enough damage done to him,&quot; TheAnonMessage wrote at 12:46 p.m. &quot;We will save the rest of our energy for the true perpetrator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar declined to comment for this story.</SPAN></P>
