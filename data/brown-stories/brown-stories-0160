<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WIGAN manager Uwe Rosler's decision to make 10 changes to his side for last night's trip to Burton backfired spectacularly as the Latics threw away a lead to lose 2-1. Martyn Waghorn was the only player who remained from Saturday's 2-2 draw with Reading but the team line-up did not seem to matter when Marc-Antoine Fortune's fine 27th-minute shot gave them the lead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But League Two Burton hit back before the break, with sub Dominic Knowles slotting home John Mousinho's clever cross in first-half stoppage time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on-loan Preston striker Stuart Beavon scored his first goal for the club seven minutes after the break after Lucas Akins' cross fell loose in the box to seal victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Williamson scored a 10-minute hat-trick as Port Vale thumped Hartlepool 6-2. Williamson scored in the eighth, 14th and 18th minutes before being taken off in the 73rd minute. Hartlepool reduced the deficit through Jonathan Franks and a penalty from Neil Austin, but Vale stretched their lead with a goal from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and two from Tom Pope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northampton substitute Lawson D'ath struck twice on his debut in a 3-2 win over Wolves at Molineux. The midfielder netted with his first touch after his 56th-minute introduction with a shot which squirmed through the hands of Wolves keeper Aaron McCarey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivan Toney headed in Kaid Mohamed's corner moments later before Wolves staged a fightback to level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nouha Dicko cracked the ball home from close range and Sam Ricketts curled the ball past Cobblers keeper Matt Duke from 25 yards out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Northampton's D'ath silenced the home fans for a second time when his shot looped over McCarey and trickled over the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Souleymane Doukara's double gave Dave Hockaday a first win as Leeds manager as the Whites brushed aside League Two Accrington Stanley 2-1. Doukara's fine touch and finish from Gaetano Berardi's delivery gave Luke Simpson no chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Striker Doukara made it 2-0 when he lashed a left-foot finish home after another neat piece of control after receiving Lewis Cook's pass. James Gray scored a late consolation for Accrington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Nottingham Forest favourite Michail Antonio spoiled Mark Palios's homecoming as the former Football Association chief executive made a losing start as Tranmere's new owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palios watched from the directors' box as new signing Antonio scored his second goal in as many games as Forest held out 1-0 with 10 men.</SPAN></P>
