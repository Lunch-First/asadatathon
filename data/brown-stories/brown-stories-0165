<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COLIN Cooper was left fuming after his Hartlepool United side crashed out of the Capital One Cup following a humiliating 6-2 defeat to Port Vale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pools boss said he couldn't sum up how disappointed he was after seeing his side hit for six in the first round of the cup competition at Vale Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An 18-minute hat-trick from Ben Williamson in the first-half put Micky Adams' side on course for victory and despite Pools pulling it back to 3-2 shortly after the re-start, it was all down hill from there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fourth Vale goal courtesy of Hartlepool-born </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - a summer transfer target for Cooper - and a Tom Pope brace wrapped up the convincing victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, it could well have been worse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott Flinders was called into making four further saves to keep the scoreline to just the six conceded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defeat last night followed the opening day loss to Stevenage in Sky Bet League Two, to cap a poor start to the new season by the Clarence Road club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper, a former defender for Middlesbrough, Nottingham Forest and England, found it hard to find too many positives from the display.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admitted his side were asking for trouble through their inability to stop crosses into the box and then properly defend the ball when it did come in from the flanks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pools squad will be in training at Maiden Castle today and their manager said they have three days to quickly improve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A despondent Cooper said: &quot;I can't sum up how disappointed I am after watching that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not something that I am very proud of, if I am honest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A team that defends its 18-yard box like that is not something I can be very proud of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have three days to put things right before Saturday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thing that disappointed Cooper the most, was the fact his side failed to properly defend their 18-yard box and to stop the flood of crosses into their box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the responsibility lies with the whole team and not just the defensive unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper added: &quot;Defending that 18-yard box is something we work a lot on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As an ex-defender you have to defend the outside of the box, in front of the box and in the box itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That doesn't matter whether you play Premier League, international football or in our case League One and League Two level football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you don't stop crosses, if you don't stop shots or don't head the ball when it comes into the box and that is the whole team implicated in that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pools, who started with a new look 4-3-3 formation, actually started the brighter of the two sides but it didn't last long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson scoring his first after eight minutes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pools equalised through a fine Jonathan Franks strike from 25-yards but Williamson then completed his hat-trick before the 18 minute mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Neil Austin penalty made it 3-2 but then substitute Brown added a fourth before Pope helped himself to two goals to put the final few nails in the Poolie coffin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper added: &quot;We looked bright in the early phases, as we did on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Against Port Vale we were a bit braver on the ball but then you look at the first goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a centre half that has had a shot, Scott then makes the first save and then their centre forward reacts quicker than we do to put it in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We then scored a nice goal but again defending in front of the box let us down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ball is fed in way too easy and we go 2-1 down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then they scored from a cross and then another cross and another cross and a shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am certainly not going to highlight any individuals but as an ex-defender that is something that I look at. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't stop the crosses, didn't stop shots and not winning headers in your 18-yard box spells trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We got ourselves back into the game twice but then went on to concede almost immediately after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no doubting there was some good spells when we played some nice stuff and created chances but that is clouded over by not being able to defend out final third.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you can't keep the ball our of your goal then you have no chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
