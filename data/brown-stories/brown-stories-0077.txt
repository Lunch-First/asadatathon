On Monday night, protests continued in Ferguson, Mo., a St. Louis suburb, in response to the weekend shooting of 
 18, who was killed by a police officer. The chaotic night was captured on social media as police officers used tear gas and rubber bullets to try to disperse the crowds. 
Antonio French, an alderman in St. Louis, posted photos and videos throughout the night.
