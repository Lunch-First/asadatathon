<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement marked the second time in less than a week that the bitter enemies had agreed to Egyptian mediation. A similar three-day truce last week collapsed in renewed violence over the weekend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truce took effect at 6 p.m. Topeka time, preceded by heavy rocket fire toward Israel. In Cairo, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said the cease-fire would allow humanitarian aid into battered Gaza neighborhoods and the reopening of indirect talks on a more lasting and comprehensive deal. Hamas is seeking an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade against Gaza, while Israel wants Hamas to dismantle its formidable arsenal of rockets and other weapons.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During an hour-long interview with The Associated Press on Sunday - her first public comments since the July 1 beating was caught on video by a passing driver - Pinnock spoke haltingly or in a whisper, occasionally putting her hands to her temples and grimacing. Her attorney Caree Harper frequently interrupted her and limited her responses to a reporter's questions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UKRAINE DEMANDS REBELS IN DONETSK SURRENDER: Fighting raged in the city of Donetsk on Sunday, as government forces continued to close in on the rebel stronghold and pro-Russian insurgents backed away from an unconditional cease-fire offer that they announced just the day before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a string of military successes and broad support for its campaign from the West and most of its domestic base, Kiev has taken a hard line against the rebel forces and promised it will only relent when the separatists surrender. Donetsk remained a ghost town on Sunday, with few civilians daring to venture outside as explosions rang out every few minutes and burnt-out buses and buildings smoldered from the night before. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Hassan Rouhani offered his condolences to victims' families and quickly ordered an investigation into the crash. Similar planes operated by Iranian carriers will be grounded until the probe is complete, he directed.</SPAN></P>
