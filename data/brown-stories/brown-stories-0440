<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even before 18-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. - before Eric Garner died after New York City police officers put him in a choke hold - civil rights advocates were calling for police officers to wear cameras that record their interactions with the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's a policy, they say, that would protect people against police brutality and exonerate officers wrongfully accused of misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's a policy already in place in at least three major departments, and in the aftermath of Brown's and Garner's high-profile cases, calls for the cameras are gaining momentum. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it's a policy that Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey says he hopes to bring to Philadelphia. He says the department is in the early stages of planning a pilot program that he wants to launch by year's end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think it's the way to go,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it's something that's long overdue in our department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brown's death Saturday in Ferguson, a small suburb of St. Louis, touched off widespread anger and protests directed at local police, whose account of the shooting differs dramatically from several witness accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> St. Louis County police have said Brown pushed an officer into a patrol car and tried to grab an officer's weapon. A friend who was walking with Brown said the officer fired at the unarmed teen as he ran with his hands in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to news reports, Ferguson had recently received a grant to equip some police cars with dashboard cameras and some officers with body cameras. But the department, Ferguson's police chief has said, did not have the money to install the cameras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's unclear whether the officer who shot Brown would have been wearing a camera had those funds been available. But, proponents say, footage from body cameras can become invaluable evidence in investigations of alleged police misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The problem in so many of these cases is it's one word against the other,&quot; said David Rudovsky, a prominent Philadelphia civil rights lawyer. &quot;. . . Given how volatile some of these incidents can be - the choke hold in New York City, this recent shooting in St. Louis - it's much better to have verifiable facts than not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cameras offer an &quot;objective view of incidents that occur when stress levels are high and decision-making is quick&quot; - where both an officer's and a citizen's perspective of what happened could be distorted, said Sgt. Ali Pillow of the Cleveland Police Department, where 200 officers were recently equipped with body cameras that clip to the front of an officer's uniform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Proponents say the very presence of cameras can defuse a tense situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These cameras can prevent bad incidents from occurring because people naturally tend to behave better if they are being recorded,&quot; Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said in an e-mail. &quot;That includes officers as well as community members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organization - of which Ramsey serves as president - is set to release a set of guidelines for police departments interested in body cameras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group's studies of the cameras, researcher Craig Fischer said, show that they strengthen police accountability, prevent confrontational situations, resolve complaints against officers, and improve transparency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a 2012 study in Rialto, Calif., on a pilot body-camera program - in which certain shifts of officers were given cameras, and others were not - found that complaints against officers decreased by 89 percent and use-of-force incidents fell by nearly 60 percent in a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Shifts without cameras experienced twice as many incidents of use of force as shifts with cameras,&quot; the study said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PERF's research has found that cameras can also create some unrealistic expectations, Fischer said. In some cases, courts begin to expect that every encounter with the public is recorded and may suspect wrongdoing if not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And body-camera programs are expensive, he said. Each camera costs $800 to $1,200, and storage and administrative costs can run into the millions. One department of 900 officers reported the associated costs of the cameras at $2 million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Philadelphia has about 6,600 officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramsey said cost was a concern, but the department would do &quot;everything we can to try to outfit as many of our officers as possible,&quot; starting with patrol officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Philadelphia police union president John McNesby said he was against the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I would be opposed to [body cameras] because it would just give another avenue for them to second-guess police,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others say cities may be able to save money by deploying body cameras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York City Public Advocate Letitia James, in a report released this week calling for the New York Police Department to order body cameras, noted that the city spent $152 million in 2013 settling claims against the department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many complaints against the department, she wrote, &quot;suffered from a lack of information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;. . . The use of cameras is likely to save the city significant money and time while restoring confidence in NYPD,&quot; James wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 2009, Philadelphia has spent more than $45 million to settle lawsuits alleging civil rights violations by police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, payouts jumped from $8.3 million to nearly $14 million. Craig M. Straw, chief deputy city solicitor, said four seven-figure settlements accounted for the rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramsey said he hoped a body-camera program would have &quot;a positive impact in a variety of areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But &quot;in the short term, we've got to buy them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision to start a body-camera program should not be taken lightly, Wexler said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Departments should have guidelines for when the cameras should be turned on - for example, he said, officers should not record every single encounter with the public, so as not to violate the privacy of witnesses and victims, or deter citizens trying to help the police by providing information. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Community members may become reticent and avoid the police if they think they'll be recorded every time they say hello,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, experts say, departments should be prepared to properly oversee the program. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Department of Justice report released in April on the Albuquerque Police Department's use of force concluded that it had &quot;reacted hastily&quot; in its launch of the cameras, which it said &quot;appeared directed only at placating public criticism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investigators received many reports of officers failing to turn their cameras on, in some cases blaming the &quot;immediacy of the situation&quot; even when &quot;the officer had a clear opportunity to record the event,&quot; according to the report. And punishment for not turning a camera on, investigators found, was rare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramsey said that his department would work to set up guidelines for the use of body cameras but that more often than not, officers should have the camera on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;By and large, you have to restrict the circumstances of when an officer turns it off,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to make an assumption that it's going to be running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, working out those details won't deter the department from moving forward, he said: &quot;The technology is there and we need to take advantage of the technology.&quot; Guidelines On Body Cameras </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guidelines from the Police Executive Research Forum say cameras should be used during:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traffic stops</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arrests</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Searches</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interrogations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pursuits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Footage should be retained for: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 60 to 90 days in most cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indefinitely in homicides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Footage should be released to the public in accordance with state disclosure laws. </SPAN></P>
