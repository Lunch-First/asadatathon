#Ferguson:
Attention has increasingly been focused on Ferguson, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis, since the Aug. 9 shooting death of 
 ! e unarmed Brown was killed by an as-yet-unnamed police o" cer and local temperatures continue to rise as a heavy police presence faced o# with protesters in the following days. President Barack Obama has since called for peace and calm and has asked the Justice Department and FBI to investigate. See page 14 for more coverage. 
The Civil Rights Act is 50 years old. These two pictures were taken 50 years apart.
Behold our progress. #Ferguson

People like the Westboro church can protest and be left alone but the protestors in #Ferguson are met with violence? Incredible. - @SamerSum
#Ferguson cops showing up with cutting edge Halo armor and Metroid guns but the police cars don't have basic recording devices? Aiight. - @SnottieDrippen
"MAYBE HE DID SOMETHING" IS NOT A JUSTIFICATION FOR SHOOTING UNARMED KIDS. PERIOD. #Ferguson - @RealLucasNeff
If a video of a celebrity scuffle in an elevator gets mass press, shouldn't we be able to see media coverage of an entire city? #ferguson - @marylambertsing
Could it be that not releasing the name of the cop is fueling the tensions? Protect him and his family - but transparency is key. #Ferguson - @JVM
