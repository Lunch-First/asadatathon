</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. - For the past week in Ferguson, reporters have been using the McDonald's a few blocks from the scene of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting as a staging area. Demonstrations have blown up each night nearby. But inside there's WiFi and outlets, so it's common for reporters to gather there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the case Wednesday. My phone was just about to die, so as I charged it, I used the time to respond to people on Twitter and do a little bit of a Q&amp;A since I wasn't out there covering the protests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I sat there, many armed officers came in - some who were dressed as normal officers, others who were dressed with more gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, both Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post and I were asked for identification. I was wearing my lanyard, but Ryan asked why he had to show his ID. They didn't press the point, but one added that if we called 911, no one would answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then they walked away. Moments later, the police reemerged, telling us that we had to leave. I pulled my phone out and began recording video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An officer with a large weapon came up to me and said, &quot;Stop recording.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I said, &quot;Officer, do I not have the right to record you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He backed off but told me to hurry up. So I gathered my notebook and pens with one hand while recording him with the other hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I exited, I saw Ryan to my left, having a similar argument with two officers. I recorded him, too, and that angered the officer. As I made my way toward the door, the officers gave me conflicting information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One instructed me to exit to my left. As I turned left, another officer emerged, blocking my path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Go another way,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I turned, my backpack, which was slung over one shoulder, began to slip. I said, &quot;Officers, let me just gather my bag.&quot; As I did, one of them said, &quot;Okay, let's take him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multiple officers grabbed me. I tried to turn my back to them to assist them in arresting me. I dropped the things from my hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My hands are behind my back,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm not resisting. I'm not resisting.&quot; At which point one officer said: &quot;You're resisting. Stop resisting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was when I was most afraid - more afraid than of the tear gas and rubber bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they took me into custody, the officers slammed me into a soda machine, at one point setting off the Coke dispenser. They put plastic cuffs on me, then they led me out the door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could see Ryan still talking to an officer. I said: &quot;Ryan, tweet that they're arresting me, tweet that they're arresting me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He didn't have an opportunity, because he was arrested as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers led us outside to a police van. Inside, there was a large man sitting on the floor between the two benches. He began screaming: &quot;I can't breathe! Call a paramedic! Call a paramedic!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ryan and I asked the officers if they intended to help the man. They said he was fine. The screaming went on for the 10 to 15 minutes we stood outside the van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to die!&quot; he screamed. &quot;I'm going to die! I can't breathe! I'm going to die!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually a police car arrived. A woman - with a collar identifying her as a member of the clergy - sat in the back. Ryan and I crammed in next to her, and we took the three-minute ride to the Ferguson Police Department. The woman sang hymns throughout the ride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this time, we asked the officers for badge numbers. We asked to speak to a supervising officer. We asked why we were being detained. We were told: trespassing in a McDonald's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope you're happy with yourself,&quot; one officer told me. And I responded: &quot;This story's going to get out there. It's going to be on the front page of The Washington Post tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he said, &quot;Yeah, well, you're going to be in my jail cell tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once at the station, we were processed, our pockets emptied. No mug shots. They removed our restraints and put us in a holding cell. Ryan was able to get ahold of his dad. I called my mom, but I couldn't get through. I couldn't remember any phone numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were in there for what felt like 10 or 15 minutes. Then the processing officer came in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who's media?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We said we were. And the officer said we were both free to go. We asked to speak to a commanding officer. We asked to see an arrest report. No report, the officer told us, and no, they wouldn't provide any names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked if there would ever be a report. He came back with a case number and said a report would be available in a week or two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chief thought he was doing you two a favor,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wesley.lowery@washpost.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ferguson Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lowery's detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following is a statement on the incident from Washington Post Executive Editor Martin D. Baron: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wesley has briefed us on what occurred, and there was absolutely no justification for his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was illegally instructed to stop taking video of officers. Then he followed officers' instructions to leave a McDonald's - and after contradictory instructions on how to exit, he was slammed against a soda machine and then handcuffed. That behavior was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news. The physical risk to Wesley himself is obvious and outrageous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being placed in a holding cell, he was released with no charges and no explanation. He was denied information about the names and badge numbers of those who arrested him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are relieved that Wesley is going to be OK. We are appalled by the conduct of police officers involved.</SPAN></P>
