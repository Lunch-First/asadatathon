<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second man was shot by police in the early hours of yesterday morning in the Missouri city where an unarmed black teenager was killed at the weekend, sparking widespread protests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said the man was shot in Ferguson by a St Louis County officer after he pointed a handgun at the officer soon after 1am, after fresh demonstrations over the death on Saturday of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer was responding to reports of shots being fired and men wearing ski masks carrying shotguns. Reports said the man was in a critical condition in hospital and a gun was recovered at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman was separately being treated in hospital after being shot in the head during a drive-by shooting in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incidents came after a peaceful end to a tense standoff between protesters and police, prompting hopes that a third night of violence might be avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson police refused on Tuesday to release the name of the officer who shot Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While police say that Brown assaulted the officer during a struggle, witnesses said he was shot while trying to run away after being grabbed by the officer when he and a friend would not leave the road and walk on the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer has been placed on paid leave while the shooting is investigated. The FBI is also looking into whether there were civil rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, President Barack Obama described Brown's death as &quot;heartbreaking&quot;. Noting the FBI investigation, he appealed for calm. &quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions but, as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and family of Brown held a church vigil on Tuesday night, after his father pleaded for an end to the violence. Standing with supporters, including Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sr said he wanted justice for his son but wanted it &quot;the right way&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way,&quot; Brown Sr said. The official response to Brown's death has been rejected as insultingly inadequate by many African American residents of Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 people where 67% of the population is black, yet 94% of the police force - and prominent figures in local government, such as the mayor - are white.</SPAN></P>
