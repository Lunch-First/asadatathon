<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities on Tuesday delayed revealing the identity of the police officer who fatally shot an unarmed teen and set off a wave of community outrage, citing threats against the officer on social media. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we come out and say, 'It was this officer,' then he immediately becomes a target,&quot; Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said. &quot;We're taking the threats seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson, who had said he would reveal the name Tuesday, said there is no timetable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Associated Press reported that witnesses said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 18,  raised his hands to surrender before the shots were fired. Police have not confirmed that. The shooting set off two nights of violent protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters promising a peaceful rally gathered across the street from the St. Louis County Police Department's Clayton headquarters. Also in attendance: about 50 police officers from 10 area departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said that protesters Monday night threw rocks at police and that gunfire came from the crowd, so officers used tear gas and shot &quot;beanbag rounds&quot; meant to stun them. There were 15 arrests but no reports of the looting that rocked the suburban St. Louis city Sunday night, KSDK-TV reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a lot of young people reacting to getting shot at with tear gas,&quot; said protester Shawn Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a community forum Monday, national NAACP President Cornell William Brooks demanded justice while condemning the violence and looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement Tuesday, President Obama called Brown's death &quot;heartbreaking,&quot; and he sent &quot;deepest condolences&quot; to his family and the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation, along with local officials,&quot; Obama added. &quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that's what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI opened an investigation Monday into Brown's death, who police said was shot multiple times.</SPAN></P>
