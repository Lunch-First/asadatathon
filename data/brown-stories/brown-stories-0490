<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office of the House of Representative Nancy Pelosi, U.S Government has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi released the following statement on the events in Ferguson, MO: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our hearts ache for the family of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and for the entire community of Ferguson, Missouri.  His death is a tragedy, and the response to neighborhood protests for transparency and accountability is deeply troubling.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope that the Governor's involvement will immediately deescalate the situation.  While we all respect the important responsibility of law enforcement in keeping people safe, law enforcement must also protect their rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I commend the President for his leadership in directing the Department of Justice to investigate the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  It is clear the Department of Justice should examine every aspect of the past few days, including whether there were any federal civil rights violations.  It should also examine the long standing issues between the citizens of Ferguson and their elected officials and local law enforcement.  A credible and comprehensive investigation is absolutely necessary to secure justice for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s family and the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
