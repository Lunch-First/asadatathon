PORT Vale are weighing up a move for a defender as well as a striker as manager Micky Adams attempts to complete his squad.
A centre-forward has been Vale's priority, but the availability of a defender they rate has raised the possibility of two signings to give the Valiants the best chance of building on last season's ninth-placed finish in League One. 
Chairman Norman Smurthwaite says Vale went well past their initial planned wage budget when they made the treble signing of Michael O'Connor, 
 and Steven Jennings.
However, the chairman has also revealed he has decided to double his planned personal investment in the club this season from 250,000 to 500,000 to allow Micky Adams to have a more competitive squad.
Meanwhile, Vale's search for a new goalscorer looks a little less urgent after Ben Williamson's hat-trick in Tuesday night's 6-2 Capital Cup win at home to Hartlepool.
The 25-year-old struck on eight, 15 and 18 minutes to record the quickest hat-trick scored by a Port Vale player since club legend Andy Jones netted three in eight minutes against Newport on May 4, 1987.  Jones went on to score four in 10 minutes and five in 20 as Vale won 6-1.
The fastest ever Vale hat-trick was scored by Fred Mitcheson against Plymouth in 1934, netting three in just three minutes.
Tuesday night's treble was the first time Williamson has scored a hat-trick in his career. The modest striker said: "I am delighted. I think I had quite a good pre-season, but it is nice to get off the mark. You wonder when your first goal is going to come, but I was very lucky to get three in this game.
"To be honest I think I shut my eyes when the cross came in for the third goal, it just came off my head and went in!
"The main thing was us getting into the next round."
