<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The FBI said it will probe the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black teen just outside St. Louis - as angry residents and cops clashed Monday for a second night of rioting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Feds and St. Louis County police will both be investigating the slaying of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 18, by a Ferguson, Mo., city cop on Saturday night.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The FBI notified me that they will be opening up an investigation that will run parallel to this investigation,&quot; St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A petty sidewalk beef between police, Brown and a pal may have sparked the deadly confrontation and ensuing riots in Ferguson, about 12 miles northwest of St. Louis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Furious that an unarmed man had been shot to death in their community, demonstrators protested Brown's killing at a candlelight vigil on Sunday night. It turned ugly when looters broke into several shops and torched a convenience store.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tensions erupted in the St. Louis suburb again on Monday evening, when riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a large crowd of protestors. At least five people were arrested, according to St. Louis County police.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dorian Johnson told WALB-TV that the fatal trouble Saturday began after he and Brown had left a convenience store and were strolling in the street and an officer told them to get on the sidewalk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When they kept walking in the street, the officer rolled up to the pair, got out of the police car and drew his gun, Johnson said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officer fired, Johnson said, and they took off running. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We wasn't causing harm to nobody,&quot; Johnson added. &quot;We had no weapons on us at all.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cops have told a different story, saying one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car before the struggle began.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said a group that had gathered at a convenience store that had been torched on Sunday night started lobbing rocks at police on Monday evening. Cops also heard gunfire coming from the crowd and responded with tear gas.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The unrest first exploded after a Sunday night vigil to demonstrate against Brown's death, when looters hit a Walmart, Walgreens and Foot Locker, according to Belmar. Police arrested 32 suspected rioters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shots were fired at cops and a police helicopter, officials said, but no one was hit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It is a miracle, however, that no one actually got shot [Sunday] night,&quot; Belmar said. &quot;I was expecting the worst.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Rev. Al Sharpton will fly to Missouri and meet with Brown's family on Tuesday.  </SPAN></P>
