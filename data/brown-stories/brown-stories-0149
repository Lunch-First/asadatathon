<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE SUBURBAN St. Louis police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teen is a marked man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ferguson, Mo., police chief opted Tuesday not to release the cop's name after the department was deluged with death threats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we come out and say, 'It was this officer,' then he immediately becomes a target,&quot; said Chief Tom Jackson. &quot;We're taking the threats seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson did not divulge details of the threats against the six-year veteran who shot 18-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Saturday - and who is now on paid administrative leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the chief spoke out after Ferguson was rocked by another night of violent protests - and after some 100 demonstrators marched on the St. Louis County courthouse Tuesday chanting, &quot;Hands up! Don't shoot!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses have said Brown was holding his hands up in surrender when he was shot. And the Browns' family lawyer said the teen was shot up to eight times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was executed in broad daylight,&quot; said Benjamin Crump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama offered condolences Tuesday and called for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I urge everyone in Ferguson, Mo., and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,&quot; he said. &quot;We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Rev. Al Sharpton was in Ferguson meeting with Brown's parents, the FBI launched a civil rights investigation.</SPAN></P>
