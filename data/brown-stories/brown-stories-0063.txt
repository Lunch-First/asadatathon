FERGUSON, MO. Tensions remained high Monday in parts of suburban St. Louis after a fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man led to overnight looting, vandalism and dozens of arrests. A closer look at the town of Ferguson, where 18 year old 
 was killed: 
Location: Ferguson is about 10 miles north of downtown St. Louis in the broader area known to locals as North County. The 2010 census counted about 21,000 residents.
Commerce: Ferguson is home of the global headquarters of Emerson Electric Co., a Fortune 500 company. Just outside the city limits is Express Scripts, the nation's largest company that manages pharmacy benefits.
White flight: Ferguson and other parts of north St. Louis County were predominantly white communities before school desegregation.
Demographics:About two thirds of residents are now black. Fewer than half of the approximately 9,100 homes are owner occupied, and about a quarter of residents live below the federal poverty level.
Schools: Several North County school districts including the Normandy system from which Brown recently graduated have lost state accreditation because of declining test scores and other academic shortcomings.
Racial profiling: A 2013 report by the Missouri attorney general's office found that Ferguson police stopped and arrested black drivers nearly twice as frequently as white motorists but were also less likely to find contraband among the black drivers. The Associated Press
