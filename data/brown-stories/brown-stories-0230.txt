HACKER group Anonymous has vowed to help the family of an unarmed black teen gunned down by police in the Missouri city of Ferguson.
Operating under the Twitter hashtag #OpFerguson, the hacktivists say the death of 18-year-old 
 was the kind of injustice being inflicted on "everyday" citizens.A video was released stating the vigilante organisation's intentions to name and shame anyone involved in what it states is an illegal cover-up.
