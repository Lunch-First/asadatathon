<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COUNTLESS PEOPLE have hoisted signs and chanted slogans at the top of their lungs on the streets of Philadelphia in recent years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their causes have varied - covering everything from income inequality to environmental concerns to overseas conflicts - but protesters in this city have all shared one thing in common: They didn't have to gag on billowing plumes of tear gas, or dodge rubber bullets that were fired by cops clad in military gear.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the world has watched in horror as protesters and reporters in the small town of Ferguson, Mo., have been met with those nightmarish conditions in the wake of a recent police-involved shooting that claimed the life of an unarmed, college-bound teen named </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have taken to social media to decry the militarized show of force that has confronted residents of Ferguson - the imposing armored vehicles, the snipers who trained rifles on unarmed civilians, the weaponry and gear that seem made for war. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, those images haven't been a part of recent demonstrations in Philly, not even during the sprawling Occupy Philly protests that took over Dilworth Plaza for two months in 2011. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one thing, the Philadelphia Police Department prefers to rely on bike cops and open lines of communication when dealing with crowds of protesters, police Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once you start pulling weapons out, it's already lost,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not trying to compare Occupy Philly to Ferguson, but they were here for 56 days. They had 42 marches, and we made 115 arrests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't use [pepper] spray or tear gas. We used the bike cops to keep everyone moving along, and we kept communicating with [Occupy's] leaders,&quot; said Sullivan, who oversees Homeland Security and the SWAT Unit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the department has also opted against splurging on sleek-looking military surplus equipment and vehicles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It sounds nice, but it's just not cost-effective,&quot; Sullivan said of retrofitting military vehicles for police use. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department owns two armored vehicles, which were purchased several years ago from a civilian company. The vehicles are supposed to be used to ferry cops into and out of dangerous situations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have any surprises. We can't shoot down any planes,&quot; Sullivan said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We get a better bang for our buck by spending money on things like training our officers and paramedics on how to respond to active-shooter situations.&quot; </SPAN></P>
