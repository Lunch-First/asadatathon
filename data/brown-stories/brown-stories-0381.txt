A scheme to let people find out if their partner has a history of domestic violence has seen the Norfolk force make only three disclosures since it started - despite having 27 requests.  
The Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme - known as Clare's Law - was rolled out in March to provide information that could protect someone from being a victim of attack.The initiative, named after 36-year-old Clare Wood, who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2009, allows the police to give information about a partner's previous history of domestic violence or violent acts.But despite 27 requests for information from members of the public, the force has made only three disclosures.A spokesman for the force said: "There are various reasons for a non-disclosure, including no relevant information to disclose, the applicant withdrew their request, inappropriate requests or requests are not relevant."There are nine remaining cases still in the process of being assessed and officers have 35 days to respond. The schemes were piloted in four areas across the country since September 2012 before being applied nationally earlier this year,  Claire's Law came in after her father, 
 campaigned for its introduction.Ms Wood was strangled and set on fire at her home in Salford, Greater Manchester, in February 2009 by George Appleton, who had a record of violence against women.Ms Wood's father is convinced she would still be alive had she known the full extent of Appleton's previous behaviour.There is more information about Claire's Law on Norfolk police's website wwww.norfolk.police.ukDo you have a crime story?
