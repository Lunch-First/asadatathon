Regarding the Aug. 12 front-page article "FBI will investigate shooting in Mo.":
Hatred of and violence toward minorities by some white law enforcement officials is still rife in 21st-century America, and it is no small wonder that black men fear and loathe white police officers. Even if 
 provoked the officer, whose race has not been identified, by verbally abusing or striking him, there was no excuse for the use of deadly force against an unarmed person. The FBI will surely sort out what happened in Ferguson, Mo., and I trust the officer will be appropriately disciplined. No matter the outcome, nothing will bring 
 back, and Ferguson now becomes the focal point for the future of race relations across the United States.
