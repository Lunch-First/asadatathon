  Police on Tuesday refused to release the name of the officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teen in a St. Louis suburb as wary cops braced for another tense night following two days of violent unrest.  
  "The value of releasing the name is far outweighed by the risk of harm to the officer and his family," said Thomas Jackson, police chief of Ferguson, Mo., where 18-year-old 
 was shot Saturday. 
  Cops have also not disclosed the officer's race, though witnesses said Brown had been confronted by a white cop who later opened fire, and 50 of the predominantly black city's 53 officers are white. 
  The lack of transparency undermined confidence in the probe, said Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the victim's family.
