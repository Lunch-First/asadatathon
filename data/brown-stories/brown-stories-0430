<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama has no business criticizing the police in a &shy;riot-torn St. Louis suburb from his posh vacation retreat more than 1,200 miles away, a top law-enforcement union official said Thursday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;To police officers, the incongruity of his evaluating police tactics from the comfort of Martha's Vineyard in the horrible tragedy which occurred in Missouri and the ensuing events is unfortunate,&quot; Jim Pasco, executive director of the national Fraternal Order of Police, told The Post. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Obama on Thursday appealed for calm and took a shot at the police a day after he was dancing and smiling during a birthday party for the wife of a longtime friend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;There is also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights,&quot; Obama said of the mayhem since the police shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 18, in Ferguson, Mo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The cop who shot the teen is a member of Pasco's group and is being represented by one of its lawyers, Pasco said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In other developments: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n A fourth night of protests in Ferguson was more peaceful than previous nights. There were no reports of violence or police action, as officers struck a more conciliatory tone with demonstrators and did not use the heavy military-style tactics seen earlier in the week. There were also protests and vigils throughout the country. A peaceful New York City demonstration in Union Square led to four arrests as some of the crowd marched uptown to Times Square. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon had put the Missouri State Highway Patrol in charge in Ferguson, with Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black, running the operation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,&quot; Nixon said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n St. Louis County police defended the use of tear gas Wednesday night to repel the bottle- and firebomb-throwing demonstrators. &quot;In talking to these guys, it is scary,&quot; a police spokesman said. &quot;They hear gunshots going off, and they don't know where they're coming from.&quot; </SPAN></P>
