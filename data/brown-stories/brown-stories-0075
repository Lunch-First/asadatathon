<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Zealand First party leader Winston Peters told his campaign launch in Auckland on Sunday that he wanted to tighten restrictions on foreign ownership, telling the audience; &quot;As they say in Beijing, two Wongs don't make a white.&quot;</SPAN></P>

I have reports of Chinese women being abused in the street [and] young louts going into Chinese shops to abuse shop keepers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
