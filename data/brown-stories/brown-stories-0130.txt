THE FBI has opened a civil rights investigation after the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager led to rioting in Missouri. 
The family of 
 demanded "justice for our son" as witnesses and police gave conflicting versions of how the 18-year-old was shot in broad daylight on Saturday.
"We think it will be very clear, when all of this is over, what really happened and how this child was executed," Brown's lawyer Benjamin Crump said.
Looters targeted more than a dozen businesses in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson on Sunday after a vigil on the footpath where Brown died erupted into clashes with police in which 32 people were arrested.
A witness identified as Dorian Johnson said he was walking with Brown when a police officer confronted them and drew his weapon.
The officer shot Brown, who "turned around and put his hands in the air," Johnson said.
But St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said Brown was killed after physically assaulting a police officer and struggling to get his weapon.
