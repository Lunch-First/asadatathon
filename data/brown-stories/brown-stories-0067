<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police still looking for 319 escapees after breakout</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack on a Haitian prison on the capital's outskirts to free the son of a prominent businessperson led to the escape of 329 inmates, officials said Monday. Police were searching nationwide for the escaped prisoners and have also asked for help from Interpol as well as authorities in the neighbouring Dominican Republic and nearby Jamaica because some men may have fled abroad. So far, authorities have only managed to capture 10 of the prisoners who escaped Sunday during an armed attack on the prison in Croix-des-Bouquets to free Clifford Brandt, a member of a wealthy family who has been held since 2012 for allegedly running a kidnapping ring. </SPAN></P>
