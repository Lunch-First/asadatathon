<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT Barack Obama has appealed for calm in a US city hit by rioting after an unarmed black teenager was shot dead by police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 18, in Ferguson, Missouri, on Saturday had prompted &quot;strong passions&quot; but that he should be remembered through &quot;reflection and understanding&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's police chief has said he will not publicly identify the officer allegedly responsible because of death threats. Civil rights leader Al Sharpton criticised the decision. He and Mr Brown's parents called for peaceful protests. Investigators say there was a scuffle after the officer asked Mr Brown and another teenager to get out of the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses have said that Mr Brown had his hands raised.</SPAN></P>
