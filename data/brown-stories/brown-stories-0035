<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds broke the windows of cars and stores following a day of demonstrations over the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an unarmed 18-year-old shot dead on Saturday by a Ferguson police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are currently experiencing a riot,&quot; a Ferguson police dispatcher said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 150 officers in riot gear from throughout St. Louis County, along with canine units, were sent to the area, a dispatcher for the St. Louis County Police Department said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no immediate word on injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Brown was shot after a struggle over a gun in a police car. It was not immediately clear why Brown as in the car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the office fired more shots before leaving the car.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our understanding at this point in the investigation, that within the police car, there was a struggle over the officer's weapon,&quot; Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests erupted soon after the shooting in Ferguson, a town of about 23,000 people some 20 miles (32 km) north of St. Louis. Some demonstrators shouted &quot;kill the police&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's mother told local TV broadcaster KSDK that her son was a &quot;good child getting ready to go to college&quot; and that he was visiting his grandmother when the incident took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He didn't bother nobody,&quot; she said. &quot;They told me how many times my son was shot - eight,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis County branch of the civil rights group NAACP has said it wants the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into the case, with many in the community telling media that race played a factor in the shooting.The police did not give any details about the officer's race.<BR>HU</SPAN></P>
