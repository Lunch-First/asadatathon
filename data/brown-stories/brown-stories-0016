<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A STRUGGLE over a cop's gun led to Saturday's lethal shooting of an unarmed black teenager in suburban St. Louis, officials claimed Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the mother of 18-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not accept the official version of the killing of her son - and said the officer who fired the deadly shots deserved the ultimate punishment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,&quot; a grieving Lesley McSpadden said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the officer was attacked after he encountered Brown and another person Saturday afternoon in front of an apartment complex in Ferguson, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the unnamed cop exited his squad car, one of the men pushed him back inside, where there was a struggle over the officer's weapon, Belmar said. At least one shot was fired in the car, hitting no one, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cop jumped out of his car and gave chase, striking Brown &quot;more than a couple times&quot; about 35 feet from the car, Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the shell casings at the scene matched bullets from the officer's gun. Brown did not have a weapon, Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,&quot; he said, adding it is unclear which of the men was struggling with the cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the second person with Brown has not been arrested or charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the law enforcement officials addressed the media at a local firehouse, hundreds of protesters chanted outside, &quot;Don't shoot!&quot; Later, some marched inside the adjacent police building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a vigil, some looting and vandalism broke out in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb. Several dozen protesters faced off with police in riot gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said he had instructed lawyers in the department's Civil Rights Division to monitor developments in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Rev. Al Sharpton announced that he planned to visit the area at the request of Brown's family to ensure a fair investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives continued to express disbelief at the killing of the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My grandson never even got into a fight,&quot; said grandmother Desiree Harris. &quot;He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local news reports said Brown was set to start college Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My son just turned 18 and graduated high school, he didn't bother nobody,&quot; the distraught McSpadden told KSDK, a St. Louis station.erosenberg@nydailynews.com</SPAN></P>
