The family of an unarmed black teenager shot dead by US police condemned a night of rioting and asked supporters not to hold any more events for fear they may again spiral out of control.
 A candlelit vigil for 
18, on Sunday night turned ugly as protesters looted stores and vandalised vehicles in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. Police said Mr Brown was shot on Saturday after a struggle over a gun in a police car. Witnesses said Mr Brown's hands were in the air when he was shot.
