MICKY Adams said Ben Williamson's 10-minute hat-trick will send the striker's confidence sky high after he helped Port Vale into the second round of the Capital One Cup with a 6-2 win at home to Hartlepool last night. 
The win was Vale's biggest ever in the League Cup, while Williamson's hat-trick, scored between eight and 18 minutes, is believed to be the fastest for the Valiants since Fred Mitcheson scored three in three minutes in 1934.
Adams was delighted the 25-year-old had netted the first  hat-trick of his career.  
The manager said: "You shouldn't underestimate that as a feat.  I am delighted for him, I am always pleased when I see a centre-forward score goals because if they don't score they think they are not contributing to the team. 
"But we all know with Ben's performances that there are other aspects to his game.
"He is the one that goes over the top and stretches defences.  He has got three good goals and that will do him the world of good." 
Vale's win was wrapped up by a first goal for the club by 
 and two from Tom Pope to add to the goal he scored in Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Walsall.  
Keeper Sam Johnson was beaten from long range for Hartlepool's first goal, which levelled the scores at 1-1, but redeemed himself with several saves in an open second half.
Adams said the 21-year old will keep his place for Saturday's League One trip to Doncaster.
The manager added: "There are aspects to Sam's game that he needs to improve on, but he is a young goalkeeper.  Was I the finished article at 21? No I wasn't, but I had to learn quickly.
"Sam will be disappointed with the goal, but I don't think I should be making changes just because of one goal."
