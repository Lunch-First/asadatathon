<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds of protesters broke windows of cars and stores after a day of demonstrations over the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an 18-year-old black teenager who was shot dead on Saturday by a police officer in the predominantly black neighbourhood of Ferguson, located a few miles north of downtown St Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time he was shot, Brown was unarmed and allegedly surrendering with his hands in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police officer shot him several times, killing him.</SPAN></P>

On Sunday evening, 30 minutes before a vigil was to be held for Brown, protesters became &quot;aggressive&quot;, according to a news report.
