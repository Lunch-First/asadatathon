<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">@BT New Screen/briefs Text - no indent;US President Barack Obama appealed for calm after what he called the &quot;heartbreaking&quot; death of a black teenager killed in a police shooting in Missouri that sparked rioting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looters targeted more than a dozen businesses in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson overnight on Sunday after a vigil &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; on the sidewalk where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> died &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; erupted into clashes with police armed with tear gas, clubs and rubber bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time,&quot; Obama said in a statement, his first public reaction to the incident, which has stirred racial tensions. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">@BT New Screen/briefs Text - no indent;Running more than 6.5km a day could be dangerous to your health, according to a study that examined how much exercise is too much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers focused on 2,400 heart attack survivors and found that the more exercise they did, the less risk they faced of dying from heart disease &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot;up to a point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefits began to decline among those who ran more than 48km per week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among walkers, the turning point, when benefits were lost, was seen in those who did more than 75km per week, or 10.5km per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more, there was a statistically significant cardiovascular risk associated with the highest levels of exercise, said the study led by Paul Williams of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Paul Thompson of the Department of Cardiology at Hartford Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers cautioned that since their study focused on heart attack survivors, their &quot;results might not be generalisable to the population at large&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For patients with heart disease, almost all should be exercising, and generally most should be exercising 30-40 minutes most days,&quot; said Carl Lavie, a cardiologist at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bieber was arrested after an alleged drag racing incident, and police say he admitted to having smoked marijuana and taken the prescription drug Xanax.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">@BT New Screen/briefs Text - no indent;Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson called for a fightback to save the traditional British pub as the Great British Beer Festival got underway on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The frontman for the British heavy metal pioneers blasted the rise of soulless, US-style bars pumping out &quot;really awful music&quot; &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; and blamed it on their giant chain owners seeing pubs as &quot;cash cows&quot; rather than community hubs.</SPAN></P>
