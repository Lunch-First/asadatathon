NORMANDY o A moment of silence at the Murchison Tabernacle CME Church on Monday evening briefly interrupted the sound of barking police dogs and chanting protesters in the suburban area rocked by riots following the death of 

Civil rights leaders at the church implored protesters to stay calm in the wake of Brown's fatal shooting by a Ferguson police officer.
More than a thousand people packed the church - and hundreds more stood on the parking lot outside - for a town hall meeting sponsored by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
"We owe it to this young man to seek justice," said Cornell Brooks, president of the NAACP who flew to St. Louis on Monday.
"We owe it to this young man to have a thorough, complete, transparent, accountable investigation by those charged with the responsibility of protecting and serving. We want no more, and we certainly want no less."
Brooks, who recently assumed his national role, said Ferguson and the area surrounding it is in the midst of an "unfolding drama," but that it must remain calm as it seeks answers.
The large crowd appeared to agree with Brooks and other leaders who addressed the crowd, although some expressed frustration with simmering racial divisions.
"We have allowed people to live in isolation without resources they need to live," said James Clark, vice president of community outreach at Better Family Life.
But Clark implored: "The eyes of the world are on St. Louis. Let's lead."
He added: "What we're dealing with right now," Clark said, "is no different from what any major city in America is dealing with."
