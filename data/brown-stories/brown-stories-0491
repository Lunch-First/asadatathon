<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office of the House of Representative Barbara Lee, U.S Government has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congresswoman Lee released the following statement on the tragic death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the ensuing violence in Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a tragedy and I offer my heartfelt condolences to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s family, friends and the entire Ferguson community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deaths of Oscar Grant, Trayvon Martin and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> serve as sad examples of the senseless murders of young African American men. As the mother of two black men and the grandmother of two black boys, I know that prejudice is endemic in our institutions, in our society and in our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I join my Congressional Black Caucus colleagues in calling for a full and independent Department of Justice investigation to determine the truth and ensure justice for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his family. The Brown family and the Ferguson community have lost a son to senseless violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence and militarization in Ferguson is deeply disturbing. It saddens me to see the images and hear reports of police officers outfitted like soldiers, journalists detained and jailed, and violence in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence in Ferguson's streets needs to stop. I encourage all outraged by this tragedy to embrace Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s nonviolent dream.  We must push forward with the peaceful passion ignited by this tragedy to fight inequality and injustice.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All Americans have a constitutional right to peacefully protest. Law enforcement officials have failed to protect and respect that fundamental right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action must be taken to restore peace and  ensure a full and transparent DOJ investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
