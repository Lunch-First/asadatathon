<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE are millions of words in the English language-and one Huddersfield musician is certainly making the most of as many as he can as well as creating a few new ones along the way, thanks to his new spoken word act. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formed only this February, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AKA Stray Weather, has been enchanting audiences across England and Europe with his clever weaving of beat poetry with a northern twang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A self-confessed rhyme slinger, he creates witty and intelligent stanzas which flow out in intricate rhythms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says that his major influence is the English language and the endless possibilities that can come from blending anything from favourite Yorkshire sayings and weird and wonderful terms with no nonsense words for maximum effect and comic timing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He plans to launch his first E.P. soon and has just returned from his first major tour, which saw him play several shows around the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His sound even translates well in Germany, where he played several gigs over the summer.</SPAN></P>
