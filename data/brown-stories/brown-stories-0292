<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early yesterday, a police officer shot and critically wounded a man who drew a handgun near the site of protests over the death of 18-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a St Louis County Police Department officer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police responded about an hour after midnight to reports of four or five men with shotguns and wearing ski masks. They encountered a number of suspects running, one of whom pulled a gun on an officer, who fired at him, the county officer said. The man was taken to an area hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after midnight, police fired tear gas into protesters who had confronted a line of officers after a far larger crowd dispersed, St Louis County Police Department spokesman Brian Schellman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A photograph in the St Louis Post-Dispatch showed a protester wearing a shirt with an American flag printed on it throwing a tear gas container back at the police.
