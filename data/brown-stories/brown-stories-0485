<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Common Dreams has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It feels like there's been a military occupation lifted off of the area,&quot; Patricia Bynes, Democratic Committeewoman of Ferguson Township, told Democracy Now! Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such was the change in atmosphere in Ferguson, Missouri, where daily protests since the police shooting on Saturday of unarmed 18-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been met with tear gas, rubber bullets and tanks, bringing widespread criticism to the nation's increasingly militarized police departments and evoking images of civil rights battles of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's gone on here over the last few days is not what Missouri is about. It's not what Ferguson is about,&quot; Gov. Jay Nixon said. &quot;This is a place where people work, go to school, raise their families, go to church. But lately it's looked a little bit more like a war zone and that's unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon said Thursday that the security responsibilities for Ferguson would be transferred to the Missouri State Highway Patrol and led by Capt. Ron Johnson, a native of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson, who is black, announced that his team would be using &quot;a different approach,&quot; and said that police would respect &quot;the anger and fear&quot; that has gripped Ferguson's residents. State troopers walked with demonstrators on Thursday night, when no riot police of tear gas were present, and some of the protestors warmly greeted Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing in front of demonstrators, Johnson held up a photo of Brown and told CNN, &quot;This is why we're here.&quot; Watch the video below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the police power transfer, the Guardian reported, &quot;a carnival-like demonstration filled the center of the city.&quot; The new atmosphere was described by the Associated Press as &quot;almost jubilant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is totally different. Now we're being treated with respect,&quot; 41-year-old Pedro Smith, 41, who has been taking part in the protests, told AP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis alderman Antonio French, who was arrested during the demonstration on Wednesday, praised the change, telling CNN, &quot;Really, it has been the police presence, the heavy-handed presence, which has escalated the situation, and I think led to the violence each night. And so it's good to see this new approach,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, suspects that Nixon's announcement was sparked not by the militarized police response against the protesters but the arrests of two journalists covering the protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The treatment that the media received ... was what many of the protesters have received the last four days,&quot; the St. Louis Post-Dispatch quotes Nasheed as saying. &quot;Only when the media get attacked in a negative manner by the police officers, only then does the governor come out and speak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In various cities across the nation, solidarity protests were held. In Baltimore and New York City on Thursday, chants of &quot;Whose streets? Our streets!&quot; rang out from the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Ferguson revealed Friday that the officer who shot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is Darren Wilson.</SPAN></P>
