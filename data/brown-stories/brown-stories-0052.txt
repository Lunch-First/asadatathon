Police arrested 32 people after rioting and looting erupted in Ferguson, Missouri, late on Sunday and spread to neighbouring towns in protests that became violent over the killing of a black teenager by a police officer, officials said yesterday.
Crowds broke the windows of cars and stores, set a building alight and looted shops following a day of demonstrations over the death of 
 an unarmed 18-year-old shot on Saturday by a Ferguson police officer.
At least two dozen businesses were damaged.
