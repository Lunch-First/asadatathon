EDGARTOWN, Mass. - President Obama said that while the shooting death of a Missouri teenager has prompted "strong passions, people should remember 
 through "reflection and understanding.
The unarmed 18-year-old was shot by a police officer Saturday while walking near his suburban St. Louis home.
Witnesses have said the officer is white and Brown was black.
Violent protests in Brown's community have ensued. A candlelight vigil for him on Sunday was followed by the looting and burning of stores, vandalized vehicles and the taunting of officers who tried to block access to parts of the city.
