<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wet 'n' Wild bosses have apologised to customers after it closed it's doors amid claims swimmers were suffering coughing and vomiting fits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly reopened attraction is currently under investigation by North Tyneside Council after youngsters reported feeling unwell on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now waterpark chiefs have said sorry - blaming &quot;technical problems&quot; for the breathing difficulties and sickness suffered by customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wet 'n' Wild closed one hour early on Friday, August 8, as a result of technical problems we were experiencing,&quot; a spokesman for Wet 'n' Wild said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the comfort of our staff and customers, we took the decision not to open on Saturday, August 9 to allow us to check all pool water and humidity levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Following a thorough investigation we re-opened on Sunday, August 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We apologise for any adverse symptoms or discomfort that may have been experienced by our customers&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The popular centre - which only re-opened on August 4 following a &pound;1.1m refurbishment - saw families flock to visit in it's first week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after less than five days the waterpark was closed early, after problems with the &quot;air quality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One teenager said he had to rush out of the water to be sick six times after becoming ill at the attraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnathan Hastings, 16, from Blakelaw in Newcastle, said: &quot;It was just horrible in there. It was so hot, I couldn't breathe and I had to keep running to the fire escape to be sick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone was coughing, even the lifeguards. One of them told me it was because of the air conditioning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The park is now back open but North Tyneside Council have said they are investigating what went wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the local authority said: &quot;We are aware of reports of breath and sickness problems at Wet'n'Wild.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can confirm that we are investigating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
