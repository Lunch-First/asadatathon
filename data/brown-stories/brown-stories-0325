<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Heritage Foundation has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., today blasted &quot;big government&quot; in response to the current situation in Ferguson, Mo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an op-ed published in Time, Paul wrote, &quot;Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem.&quot; He continued:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies--where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking about the photos and footage coming out of Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis, Paul wrote that they &quot;resemble war more than traditional police action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kentucky senator, however, also sounded a cautious note about the protests in Ferguson, writing, &quot;The outrage in Ferguson is understandable--though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace,&quot; Paul added, &quot;but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been protests in Ferguson since the death of 18-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was killed in an interaction with a police officer Saturday.</SPAN></P>
