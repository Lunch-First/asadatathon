<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were at least two versions of the encounter that led to a police officer fatally shooting an unarmed Ferguson teenager on Saturday: one from a young man named Dorian Johnson who told reporters he had been walking with the victim, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the second from St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The versions agree on some basic facts: The officer approached the teens, who were walking in the street, there was an altercation in or near the car, and the officer fired several shots at the unarmed Brown, who was then several yards away, killing him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Johnson's version, the officer reached out of the car to grab Brown by the throat. In Belmar's version, which cited his department's investigation, Brown reached into the car to attack the officer, and struggled to grab his weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHNSON'S VERSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Me and my friend was walking down the street in the middle of the street. And we wasn't causing any harm to nobody. We had no weapons on us at all. ... A police officer squad car pulled up and when he pulled up these were his exact words: 'Get the F on the sidewalk.' ... He reversed his ... car in a manner to where it almost hit us. ... He tried to brush his door open but he was so close to us that it ricocheted off us and it bounced back to him, and I guess that, you know, got him a little upset. And at that time ... he didn't get out the car, he just reached his arm out the window and grabbed my friend around his neck and ... as he was trying to choke my friend, he was trying to get away, and the officer then reached out and he grabbed his arm to pull him into the car. ... His weapon was drawn and he said, 'I'll shoot you' or 'I'm going to shoot,' and in the same moment the first shot went off. And we looked at him, he was shot, and there was blood coming from him, and we took off running, and as we took off running, I ducked and hid for my life because I was afraid for my life ... . My friend kept running and he told me to keep running because he feared for me, too. So, as he was running, the officer was trying to get out of the car and once he got out the car he pursued my friend, but his weapon was drawn. Now, he didn't see any weapon drawn at him or anything like that. I was going for no weapon. His weapon was already drawn when he got out the car. He shot again and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and he started to get down but the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and he fired several more shots, and my friend died. He didn't say anything to him, he just stood over and was shooting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELMAR'S VERSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday about noon in the 2900 block of Canfield, a Ferguson police officer had an encounter with two individuals on the street. In fact, one of those individuals ... allegedly pushed the police officer back into the car where he physically assaulted the police officer. It is our understanding at this point in the investigation that within the police car there was a struggle over the officer's weapon. There was at least one shot fired within the car. After that the officer went back, came back out of the car, he exited his vehicle, and there was a shooting that occurred where the officer in fact shot the subject, and ... they were fatal injuries. The entire scene from approximately the car door to the shooting is about 35 feet. There were shell casings recovered, the shell casings are all matched to one weapon, that's the officer's weapon. There were more than a few shell casings recovered. I cannot say at this time how many times the subject was struck by gunfire. It's hard to know, it was more than just a couple but I don't think it was many more than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
