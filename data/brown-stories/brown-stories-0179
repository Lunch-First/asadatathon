<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police on Tuesday refused to release the name of the officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teen in a St. Louis suburb as wary cops braced for another tense night following two days of violent unrest.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The value of releasing the name is far outweighed by the risk of harm to the officer and his family,&quot; said Thomas Jackson, police chief of Ferguson, Mo., where 18-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was shot Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cops have also not disclosed the officer's race, though witnesses said Brown had been confronted by a white cop who later opened fire, and 50 of the predominantly black city's 53 officers are white. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The lack of transparency undermined confidence in the probe, said Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the victim's family. </SPAN></P>
