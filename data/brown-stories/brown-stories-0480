</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office of the Governor, The State of Missouri has issued the following press release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Jay Nixon tonight spoke to a community meeting of civic and faith leaders at Christ the King United Church of Christ in North St. Louis County. Below are his prepared remarks: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good evening. I appreciate having the opportunity to speak with you tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, I'd like to recognize Reverend Blackmon and the many faith and civic leaders with us, all of whom have been doing a lot of hard work, without much sleep, leading this community during a very difficult time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just had an opportunity to meet with Amy, Mikal and Rev. Carlton Lee, who you will hear from later tonight.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like them and like all of you, I've done a lot of praying over the past few days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a father of two sons, I've prayed for the parents and loved ones of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. I've prayed for the residents and businesses and children of this community. I've prayed for justice. For wisdom. And for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We stand together tonight, reeling from what feels like an old wound that has been torn open afresh. A wound that hadn't quite healed right in the first place, and now the pain is just as searing as when the injury first occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its aftermath, the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> left a family in mourning... a community in crisis... and an entire nation looking for answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, as we grieve for what Michael's family and this community has lost... the charge is ours to make sense of the senseless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This tragedy is a challenge to all of us, not only to the citizens of Ferguson - but to all Missourians - to join hands and begin a journey of reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To have patience for the investigation that is now underway, but be unwavering in our insistence that it be open, thorough and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To keep the peace, while remaining uncompromising in our expectation that justice must not simply be pursued, but achieved. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To express the anger and frustration that we rightfully feel in a way that respects the living, and honors the memory of the young man we mourn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of crisis, we must show calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of burning bridges in anger, we must build them with love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when these traumatic events threaten to open a chasm of distrust, we must fill it with understanding and compassion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember what the Lord tells Zechariah in the Old Testament: 'Administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another....In your hearts do not think evil of each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This community has lost a precious life... but we will not lose hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will find the answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will heal our wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will not succumb to darkness and fear, but rather take courage, and walk the long, hard road toward the light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll do it for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his family, for the citizens of this community, and for all Missourians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we must do it together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you again and God Bless. </SPAN></P>
