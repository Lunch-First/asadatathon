<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE FBI has opened an investigation into the death of an unarmed African-American teen who was shot and killed by a St. Louis area cop over the weekend, police said Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Michael Brown,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 18, was in retreat with his arms raised when he was fatally shot during a confrontation with a white cop in a suburban street Saturday, witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had his hands up in the air and the officer continued shooting - which is an execution,&quot; charged the victim's grandfather, Leslie McSpadden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's relatives were speaking on MSNBC with the Rev. Al Sharpton, who plans on traveling to their home in Ferguson, Mo., Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They demand justice,&quot; family lawyer Benjamin Crump said. &quot;He was running away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds gathered in Ferguson the night after the shooting at what was supposed to be a peaceful candlelight vigil - but it turned into a night of looting and mayhem, which his family quickly denounced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not for this,&quot; Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said on Sharpton's program. &quot;The violence needs to stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People looted a convenience store, a check-cashing store and a boutique, among other businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were scattered reports of gunshots throughout the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer in Brown's shooting, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and was placed on administrative leave, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our understanding at this point in the investigation, that within the police car, there was a struggle over the officer's weapon,&quot; he said at a press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Phillip Walker, who said he watched the incident from his porch, told The Associated Press that Brown &quot;was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's family lawyer said the victim - who was set to start college this week - was shot up to eight times. He accused the cop of leaving the dying teenager on the roadway and taking off without summoning medical help.</SPAN></P>
