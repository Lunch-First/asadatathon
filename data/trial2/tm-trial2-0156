<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the group's success at garnering capacity crowds year after year, it isn't far-fetched to argue that returning British reggae band Steel Pulse was the perfect choice to spark up another run of shows at Pacific Amphitheatre this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outfit's members - anchored consistently by vocalists David Hinds and Selwyn Brown, plus masterful keyboardist Sidney Mills - are veterans of their craft, delivering ample, uplifting hits spanning nearly four decades of rockin' steady.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appearance Saturday saw them in top form, bringing an air of infectious glee to their 16-song set that spread through the audience like convivial contagion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the droves of fans (many clad in black, gold, red and green) who packed in for this opening Saturday night of the OC Fair's five-week season hit a high point even before the headliners took the stage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quite literally, actually: many of them ignited copious amounts of cannabis early on while Santa Barbara-based, Hawaii-bred band Iration blazed through a short opening set of upbeat, tropical-tinged tunes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with a few carefree cuts from just-released third album &quot;Automatic,&quot; the group did good by playing to the crowd's lifted spirits with a sunny cover of Tom Petty's &quot;Mary Jane's Last Dance.&quot; Bonus for local music fans: one of Dana Point's most down-home artists, Micah Brown, sat in as backup singer and occasional lead guitarist for the entire set. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its audience well-buzzed in advance, Steel Pulse had no trouble enhancing the veritably vivacious vibe. Hinds &amp; Co. settled in with a strategic set that began with a few revered pop-reggae hits to get people moving: &quot;Prodigal Son,&quot; &quot;Roller Skates&quot; and the Marcus Garvey-eulogizing &quot;Worth His Weight in Gold (Rally Round).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, true to their more serious activist undertones, they rocked through some slow-burning protest songs, including the passionately sung &quot;No More Weapons,&quot; the Kingston-meets-Motown feel of &quot;A Who Responsible&quot; and the hip-hop-infused &quot;Drug Squad,&quot; which came off equally fun-loving as saxophonist Jerry Johnson captivatingly crushed his extended jazzy solo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while &quot;Steppin' Out&quot; marked the hardiest party point near the end of a four-song encore - &quot;That's why we'll love you forever!&quot; shouted Hinds in reaction to an overpowering sing-along on the chorus - the show concluded with a timely social message. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pausing to wish backing vocalist and dancer Keysha McTaggert a happy birthday, the frontman segued to something more somber: &quot;Speaking of anniversaries, it's been 100 years since the birth of Rosa Parks ... and coming up on 50 years in August since (Martin Luther King Jr.'s) 'I Have a Dream Speech,' &quot; he mentioned, dipping into the acoustic-led &quot;Let Freedom Ring.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hinds reiterated that intimation shortly before the end: &quot;I'm sad to say that 100 years after the birth of Rosa Parks, we're still out here in the streets fighting for justice. ... This last song is a special tribute to Trayvon Martin.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that, the group launched into recently released single &quot;Put Your Hoodies On,&quot; poignantly capturing the outfit's penchant for embedding social consciousness within cool, spirit-elevating grooves. Safe to say this audience was feeling the intoxicating result on all levels.</SPAN></P>
