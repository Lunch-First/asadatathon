<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMERICA was braced for the threat of race riots last night after a neighbourhood watch volunteer was acquitted of murdering an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City leaders and police appealed for calm as George Zimmerman walked free from court following the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, who has been warned to wear a bullet-proof vest if he ventures outside, went into hiding after receiving death threats on Twitter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also reports of sporadic violence at angry demonstrations across the US - with protesters in California smashing windows and starting fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's five-week trial had divided the nation, with many believing the killing and subsequent police handling of case was racially motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops failed to act for several weeks until a national outcry led prosecutors to bring charges against Zimmerman, who was described in court as a wannabe police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He shot Martin during a violent struggle after the youngster was seen acting suspiciously in a gated complex which Zimmerman patrolled in Sanford, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed Martin had gone for his gun after he challenged the youngster over his behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After more than 16 hours of deliberation a jury unanimously decided that Zimmerman had acted in self defence. They ruled that he &quot;justifiably&quot; killed the unarmed lad because he believed his life was being threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they rejected prosecution claims that screams heard on a recording of a 911 call by Zimmerman were actually Martin pleading for his life. Following J Saturday's verdict, tens of thousands vented their fury on Twitter. One described Zimmerman as &quot;a dead man walking&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's heartbroken parents Tracy and Sybrina, from Miami, were not in court to hear the verdict. But they too called for calm, despite admitting their disappointment at the controversial acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy tweeted: &quot;God blessed me &amp; Sybrina with Tray and even in his death I know my baby is proud of the FIGHT we along with all of you put up for him. GOD BLESS.&quot; Devastated Sybrina told wellwishers that she was drawing strength from her faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She wrote on Twitter: &quot;Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you. You are all that I have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police later revealed that authorities in Sanford and other parts of the US were taking precautions against the possibility of mass protests or civil unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County Sheriff Don Eslinger said: &quot;I'm sure none of us wants to see any violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even as he spoke crowds gathered outside the courthouse to voice their outrage. Many were chanting: &quot;The system has failed us!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyer Mark O'Mara revealed that Zimmerman and his wife Shellie had been forced into living &quot;like hermits&quot; because of the strength of feeling surrounding the court case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they had not even been able to go to work because of fears of being attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr O'Mara added: &quot;Although he is very, very happy about the court's decision I think that Mr Zimmerman just wishes he could wave a magic wand and get his life back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He and his wife have to be cautious and protective of their safety because there is a fringe element who have said on Twitter and elsewhere that they want revenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Beyonc&eacute; called for a silent tribute in memory of Martin at a concert during her Mrs Carter Show World Tour at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concert had started about 30 minutes after news of the Zimmerman verdict began to circulate through the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The singer told fans: &quot;I'd like to have a moment of silence for Trayvon&quot;, before singing a chorus of I Will Always Love You.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">even in his to death I know he is proud of the fight we and you put up for him MARTIN'S DAD TRACY</SPAN></P>
