<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ryan Coogler, the director of &quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; answered emotional questions from the audience at Lincoln Center's Summer Talks series Thursday. Coogler, whose buzzed-about film is based on the real-life story of Oscar Grant, an unarmed 22-year-old black man who was fatally shot on an Oakland subway platform by a white cop, commented on the Trayvon Martin case, telling attendees, &quot;It affects you and depresses you and saddens you, because I think you know Trayvon had love in his life and potential.&quot; He continued, &quot;There are millions of Americans that don't see Trayvon's potential. They look at him and see him as a thug who got what he deserved. You know he was a 17-year-old boy that couldn't even vote yet, had never been arrested, never had a criminal record. My question is, why do people look at him and see that?&quot; Coogler concluded, &quot;We look at him and see something else. We look at him and see us.&quot; He said he hopes people will leave the movie asking the question, &quot;What is the value of human life?&quot;   </SPAN></P>
