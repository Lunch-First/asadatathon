<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ex-official gets 19 years for bribery</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former manager with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was sentenced to more than 19 years in prison Thursday for orchestrating a $30 million bribery and kickback scheme that authorities called historic in scope. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan called Kerry Khan's conduct, which included wiretapped conversations describing a planned sexual encounter with a teenage girl, &quot;shocking, vicious and cruel.&quot; The judge imposed a sentence four years longer than what prosecutors wanted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman jury can apply lesser charge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an unmistakable setback for George Zimmerman, the jury at the neighborhood watch captain's second-degree murder trial was given the option Thursday of convicting him on the lesser charge of manslaughter in the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Debra Nelson issued her ruling over the objections of Zimmerman's lawyers shortly before a prosecutor delivered a closing argument in which he portrayed the defendant as an aspiring police officer who assumed Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Department spokesman Glen Johnson said Thursday that doctors have determined that the 74-year-old Heinz Kerry suffered a seizure at the couple's home in Nantucket last weekend, but the precise cause of the seizure has not been determined. Doctors previously ruled out brain tumor, heart attack or stroke as possible triggers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced the arrests Thursday after an undercover operation that included officers from 16 states, three federal agencies and three Asian countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal judge Thursday ordered the government to stop genital searches of Guantanamo Bay detainees who want to meet with their lawyers, concluding that the motivation for the searches is not to enhance security, but to deter the detainees' access to attorneys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a blistering 35-opinion, Royce Lamberth, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Washington, ordered prison commanders to return to the old search method: grasping the waistband of a detainee's trousers and shaking the pants to dislodge any contraband.</SPAN></P>
