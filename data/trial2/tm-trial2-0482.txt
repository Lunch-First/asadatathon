AN APP that allowed gamers to mete out vigilante justice as TrayvonMartin was pulled off the Internet Tuesday.
Google removed "Angry Trayvon" from its online store after a petition expressed outrage at the game that appeared to exploit Martin's death. 
In the game, a character wearing a bandana over his face and a hoodie similar to the one Martin wore when he was killed last year clobbers bearded attackers with a bat.
The petition on Change.org, directed at Google, insisted "The death of this young man is NOT A GAME."
The developer of "Angry Trayvon," Trade Digital, apologized in a message that has since been removed from its Facebook page.
