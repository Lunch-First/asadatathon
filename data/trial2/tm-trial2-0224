<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We asked our Twitter followers: What do you think of George Zimmerman being acquitted of murder?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's sad, but people wouldn't be shocked if news media hadn't treated him as if he were already guilty. The jury was free of influence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">@lisa790</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman can be best friends with Casey Anthony and O.J. Simpson now. They all have one thing in common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">@JaysonFlores92</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reasonable doubt. Only two people know what really happened, and one of them can't tell his story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">@jjm0727</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tragic as Trayvon Martin's death was, I think it would be a travesty if Zimmerman were convicted on fear of public backlash.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a &quot;justice&quot; system lets a man who stalked and killed a child walk free, it's time to change the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">@TXBlueChick</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecution blew it with second-degree murder charge. A guy guilty of manslaughter got away with killing a fellow human being.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With key facts unknown, such as whose voice was calling for help and who attacked first, not guilty was the only possible outcome.</SPAN></P>
