<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, was a neighborhood watch volunteer at his Sanford, Fla., gated community when he fatally shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on Feb. 26, 2012. Zimmerman is of white and Latino heritage - his mother is Peruvian - something friends and relatives have cited to rebut allegations that he racially profiled Martin, who was black. Zimmerman had a legal permit to carry the gun he used, and he said he fired in self-defense after Martin attacked him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was 17 when Zimmerman shot and killed him. His parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, divorced when he was a child, and he was living in Miami Gardens, Fla., with his mother and brother. He was visiting his father in Sanford when he encountered Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark O'Mara</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara is Zimmerman's lawyer. A criminal and family law attorney in central Florida for 28 years, he is a former felony prosecutor and has extensive trial experience in state and federal criminal defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernie de la Rionda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda is the assistant state attorney who presented the prosecution's case against Zimmerman. He was selected by the special prosecutor in the case, Angela Corey. She had been appointed by Florida Gov. Rick Scott to investigate Martin's shooting following protests over the Sanford Police Department's failure to arrest Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debra Nelson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson is the Seminole County judge who presided in the case. According to her online biography, Nelson was admitted to the Florida and Texas bars in 1979 and was appointed to the bench in 1999. She was assigned the case in August after the previous judge stepped aside amid allegations that statements he had made could be interpreted to indicate bias against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
