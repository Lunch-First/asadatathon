<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMERICA is gripped by the George Zimmerman trial. The fate of the Hispanic vigilante who shot and killed unarmed black teen, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, has become the biggest race sensation since OJ Simpson was acquitted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With more twists and turns than an episode of Law &amp; Order, the seemingly open-and-shut case has got the airwaves buzzing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was the way a TV network doctored the tape of a 911 call, to make Zimmerman sound racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was the victim's girlfriend who was destroyed by the defence, unable even to read a letter she supposedly wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a &quot;knock knock&quot; joke used by Zimmerman's &quot; lawyer as the victim's mother sobbed in open court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drugs in Trayvon's system and witnesses who saw the teen on top of Zimmerman - the pendulum has swung back and forwards, making this more like entertainment than a murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time you read this the verdict will probably be out - and guilty or innocent, the debate will rage for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's disturbing to see how political the case has become - with Republicans largely - supporting the defence and outraged Democrats rallying to the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most appalling aspect that has emerged is yet ANOTHER Obama abuse of power - one that would be unthinkable in Britain. It has emerged the Department of Justice PAID for protests over the Trayvon killing - funding activists to march, even - as charges were being considered against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine Home Secretary Theresa May trying that - a British judge would have dismissed the case in two seconds flat for prejudicing a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing is certain - Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was unarmed. And if America had gun control, a fist fight between the two men is the worst thing that would have happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, one young man is dead and the other is having his life turned upside down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no potential Presidential candidate shows any sign of being willing to slow down - america's own private arms race - and we can bet Trayvon won't be the last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abuse</SPAN></P>
