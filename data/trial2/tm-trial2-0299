<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some were angry, shouting &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others just cried &quot;No!&quot; - with entire families breaking into tears and holding each other. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Some 100 protesters gathered in disbelief outside the Seminole County courthouse last night, as many worried that the verdict gives George Zimmerman and other vigilante neighborhood watchmen a &shy;license to kill. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I at least thought he was going to get something - something!&quot; Rosie Barron, 50, told The Post tearfully outside the courthouse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He should've gotten something. He was told to stand down,&quot; said Ed Barnett, 57, of Liberty City. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;What can we do?&quot; he asked.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Michael Vick went to jail for killing a DOG and Zimmerman killed an innocent human and goes free.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald Trump weighed in on the side of the defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Zimmerman is no angel but the lack of evidence and the concept of self-defense, especially in Florida law, gave the jury little other choice,&quot; he wrote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Peacable mini-protests popped up throughout the city. In Harlem, Ian Jackson joined a dozen other neighbors in holding &quot;Honk for Trayvon&quot; signs. </SPAN></P>
