<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the trial of George Zimmerman took place about 2,500 miles away in Florida, the ripples of the controversial &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict for the man who fatally shot teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin were felt in local communities over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do believe in our criminal justice system. However imperfect it is, it's still probably the best we have in the world,&quot; Assemblyman Curt Hagman, R-Chino Hills, said Sunday. &quot;I have faith that the jury knows far more than we do as far as the facts of the case and support whatever decision they came up with.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman trial just reaffirms what one Colton resident said is the everyday existence of black men in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The African-American community is used to being looked at differently in the eyes of the law,&quot; said Miles Whitehead, 71. &quot;You see, we live in different worlds. There's the black man's world and then there's everyone else's world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the roles were reversed and young Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had killed Zimmerman, there would be no controversy, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My grandson, who is a college student at Cal Poly Pomona, is pulled over by the police at least once a week,&quot; Whitehead said. &quot;He's a young black man that drives my old Mercedes Benz. The tags are always up to date and he is very insured, but he drives while being black in Pomona. Need I say more?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Brown, formerly the president of the Pasadena branch of the NAACP for 12 years, is disappointed in the Zimmerman verdict, but sees an opportunity in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Young people of all ethnic groups need to become more socially engaged in the legislative process,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe the young people now will become more galvanized and pay more attention now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, he'd like to see changes to laws like Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which allows people to use deadly force when they believe they're threatened, even when the option to leave the area exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is their era, this is their time, and this is what I believe the Martin family would want to see come out of this,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monrovia community activist Ralph Walker questioned whether justice was served with the Zimmerman verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can you really just take someone's life and not serve any time?&quot; Walker said Sunday. &quot;But then you think about history and Emmett Till, and there was no justice there. And now you fast forward to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and there's no justice there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Till, a 14-year-old African-American, was killed in Mississippi in 1955 after he reportedly flirted with a white woman. The woman's husband and her half-brother, who later admitted to beating him and gouging out one of his eyes, were acquitted on charges of kidnapping and murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There would never have been a trial if the people hadn't demanded justice&quot; after Martin's killing, Walker said. &quot;Otherwise, this would have been another case that no one would have known anything about, down in the swamps of Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker scoffed at those who downplay the racial aspect of the killing, subsequent trial and verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For those who think it's over, it's not over. Race in America is always the elephant in the room that no one wants to bring up,&quot; he said. &quot;We're still engaged in a civil war, and if you think about it, when the president of the United States cannot get respect from the people he works with, how can Trayvon&nbsp;Martin?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense attorneys did a &quot;tremendous job&quot; leveraging prejudice against black men, according to Walker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He made the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin 'that black man, with the hood, who could be breaking into your house,'&quot; Walker said. &quot;So the fear of the black man, or the fear of a person of color, continues in America. It's that continuous story that still goes on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict has sent a chill through the African-American community, according to Walker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think every mother, every dad, who has an African-American son, is on alert: Know where they're going, because once they leave the house, they're not guaranteed to come home,&quot; he said. &quot;Thank God, I have three daughters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
