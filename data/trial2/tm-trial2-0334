<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker made her case last week for getting cameras out of the courtroom in high-profile trials. &quot;The excessive coverage and commentary we've watched in recent years may be good theater but bad for justice. Most recently, we've been witness to the carnival trial of George Zimmerman, charged in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. We've seen the families; we've met neighbors and friends; and we've heard the screaming on the recorded 911 call.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parker argues that most trials that end up on TV are much more about entertainment than any loftier purpose like the public's right to know. She's right; most televised trials are there for market share and that usually is achieved by satisfying the public's prurient viewing pleasure. Let's face it, mundane trials make mundane TV. No one televises the contract dispute, the second-degree burglary trial, or the slip and fall, unless, perhaps, it involves Kim Kardashian slipping on sea-gull guano on Rodeo Drive. &quot;If our concern were truly to better understand the machinations of the judicial system ... we would record and broadcast all trial proceedings rather than only the ones that involve key elements of modern tabloid storytelling, namely sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll - and race. &quot;The Zimmerman trial is riveting not because two men got in a scuffle and one of them died or because one was a teenager and the other an armed adult. It is that one was black, the supposed victim of a profiling vigilante, and the other white... .&quot; Again, Parker's observations are valid. There is something important missing when almost the only trials the public sees are the equivalent of Lifetime Movies With Lawyers. A compelling case, can be made, for instance, for letting the public see some serious drama. How about the U.S. Supreme Court in action? I disagree with Parker, however, on whether the Zimmerman trial should have been televised. From the moment that the tragic shooting came to light, this case, rightly or wrongly, became a referendum on race relations - an issue that ought to matter to everyone. At some point those tuning in, watching recaps or reading about it, surely have felt compelled to do some mental role-playing, Maybe they've put themselves in either the place of Zimmerman, the volunteer neighborhood watch captain turned second-degree murder defendant, or Martin, the 17-year-old victim irate over being targeted. What would we do in a similar situation? Would we exercise better judgment? Would we have followed the police dispatcher's message to Zimmerman that he could stand down and wait for authorities to arrive? Was Zimmerman acting in self defense when he shot the unarmed Martin? Was Martin also acting in self defense when he fought back? On balance, airing the Zimmerman trial has done more social good than social harm. If nothing else, it's made us think. That could not be said for most other high-profile trials. The O.J. Simpson trial shed some light on domestic violence, which exacts a brutal toll respecting no social or racial boundaries. But the hows and whys of Nicole Brown Simpson's death became secondary, overshadowed by a circus: showboating attorneys, a judge enamored with the limelight, bumper-sticker arguments, &quot;If it (glove) doesn't fit, you must acquit,&quot; and Simpson went free. That case also involved questions of race. The trial and how it ended turned into a referendum on the jury system. At least briefly, the nation lost faith in an institution, which, with a few anomalies, is better than any other system devised. I do not know what the social take-away is from the Casey Anthony trial two years ago. Millions of armchair jurors tuned in and became heavily, if not obsessively, invested in the outcome of the troubling case involving the death of a 2-year-old. Anthony was acquitted of felony charges. As with O.J. before her, she became a public pariah, convicted in the court of public opinion, which proves that there are all kinds of justice. If anything, the trial became a referendum on how much the public should be influenced by legal commentators, many of whom smugly proclaimed, moments before the verdict, that Anthony would be found guilty on all counts. &quot;You could argue that never before in the history of criminal trials in America have so many who pretended to know so much for so long been so wrong so quickly,&quot; one chagrined analyst later admitted. Don't look for a referendum on any social issue coming out of the televised murder trial of Jodi Arias, convicted in her former boyfriend's death. Had Arias been a homely sociopath. Had her sexual escapades not been part of the story. Had she not engaged in overkill - stabbing her victim, slitting his throat and shooting him; had she not changed her testimony as often as she changed demeanor, would the TV networks have paid any attention? Instead they aired the entire five-month reality show. And re-trial of the penalty phase has not yet begun. Obviously, there should be some restraints, some common sense about what ends up on TV. Cameras do change the tenor of trials. Years ago, the &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine examined the issue, arguing that judges must retain some latitude in keeping cameras out if they are convinced that their presence &quot;may intimidate vulnerable witnesses, prejudice the jury or turn the public against a notorious or unpopular defendant.&quot; But on the other side of the argument, &quot;The Economist&quot; said, is the fact that the courts perform the people's business. &quot;The public's confidence in the justice system is a pillar of the rule of law. It is difficult to understand how citizens can be expected to have confidence in a system that most never see.&quot; Julie DelCour, 918-581-8379 a class=&quot;ArticleLink&quot; href=&quot;mailto:julie.delcour@tulsaworld.com&quot;julie.delcour@tulsaworld.com SUBHEAD: Trials, tribulations of cameras in the courtroom </SPAN></P>
