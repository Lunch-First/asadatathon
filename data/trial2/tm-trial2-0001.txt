A SIX-woman jury has found neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering unarmed black teenager TrayvonMartin, in a racially charged trial that transfixed the US. 
``Mr Zimmerman, I have signed the judgment that confirms the jury's verdict,'' Judge Deborah Nelson said, soon after the decision was read yesterday over the killing in February last year.
Mr Zimmerman smiled when the verdict was read.
His family grinned broadly as they sat behind him.
The family of TrayvonMartin was not present.
The jury had deliberated for more than 16 hours since Friday.
Mr Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing Martin through a gated community in Sanford, Florida, and shooting him during an altercation.
Mr Zimmerman faced possible life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder.
Martin's family members shared their sentiments on Twitter.
``God blessed Me & Sybrina with Tray and even in his death I know my baby proud of the fight we along with all of you put up for him God bless,'' Tracy Martin, Trayvon's dad, tweeted seconds after the verdict was announced.
Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon's mum, didn't speak out until an hour after the verdict.
``I will love you forever Trayvon In the name of Jesus''.
Trayvon's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, tweeted ``Et tu, America?'' .
