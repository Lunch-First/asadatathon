<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 15--George Zimmerman's acquittal produced mixed reactions from Monroe County residents Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman supporters were somewhat muted in their response while those who believed that the community watch member murdered Trayvon&nbsp;Martin were in disbelief and expressed a lack of confidence in the justice system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody from my congregation in New York to my friends in California, this hit us like a tsunami wave. It hit everybody,&quot; Tonyeaka Grant of Saylorsburg said. &quot;My friends were in tears. Some of them couldn't even breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Counterman of Price Township said he was surprised by the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He really should have gotten second-degree murder. That's as prejudiced as prejudice gets,&quot; Counterman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant said she may have supported some kind of lower-level conviction against Zimmerman given the uncertainty about the fight between the two men, but she couldn't stand for him walking free after killing an unarmed Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't have cared if he would have gotten hit with jail time for two years. Put him in there for something. He had a loaded weapon. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had nothing,&quot; Grant said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheryl Wilson of Canadensis said the case was the latest example of racial prejudice affecting the criminal justice system, and that the evidence proved Zimmerman was guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police told Zimmerman not to pursue Trayvon. Based on that alone, Zimmerman broke the law. He disobeyed the police and pursued Trayvon anyway, even though he was not a threat to him,&quot; Wilson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Hudson of Tannersville said Martin posed no real threat to Zimmerman, so the self-defense story is irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You think the use of deadly force might be appropriate. But in reality, it's never appropriate because it's not like his life was being threatened,&quot; Hudson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wanda Lasher of Stroudsburg said watching the case on TV actually convinced her that Zimmerman could be found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Following the case changed my perspective. Initially, I was on the borderline, but as the evidence was brought forward, I figured the acquittal was there,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marcy Schock of Bangor said she wasn't very passionate one way or the other, but felt that Florida prosecutors could have made a better case against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think one of the reasons it came out the way it was was that the prosecution could have done better,&quot; Schock said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lindsey Jones of Stroudsburg compared the case to another Florida incident, in which a woman named Marissa Alexander was convicted despite using the same &quot;stand your ground&quot; defense Zimmerman did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Florida needs to get their act together. It's not even,&quot; Jones said. &quot;They need to have consistency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
