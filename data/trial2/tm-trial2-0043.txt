A RACE row raged in the US after a neighbourhood watchman was found not guilty of killing an unarmed black teenager. 
Protests were sparked in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta when a jury cleared George Zimmerman over the 17-year-old's murder.
He was also acquitted of the lesser manslaughter charge.
Gangs of youths attacked police and torched cars while others smashed windows in a downtown area of Oakland, California. Zimmerman shot and killed TrayvonMartin in gated community The Retreat in Sanford, Florida, in February last year.
Zimmerman had been driving through the area when he spotted Martin wearing a hoodie walking to a nearby house where he had been staying with friends.
He called the police, claiming Trayvon was behaving suspiciously but before they arrived he confronted the youngster and fired a shot from his 9mm handgun.
He was originally released without charge but after a public outcry a murder probe was launched. In court, Zimmerman's lawyers successfully argued he had been acting in self-defence and claimed Trayvon had attacked him.
The tension was raised after the Florida jury took two days and 16 hours to clear the 29-year-old.
Police and community chiefs urged locals in Sanford to stay calm.
But rap star P Diddy, 43, voiced his outrage at the verdict, tweeting: "George Zimmerman is free #not right ##NoJusticeForTrayvon."
Pop babe Rihanna, 25, also hit out at the decision to free Mr Zimmerman, saying it was "the saddest news ever".
