</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. President Barack Obama urged Americans to respect the decision of jurors on Sunday following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a case that has bitterly divided the country along racial and partisan lines since the boy was gunned down more than a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions,&quot; Obama said in a statement in which he referred to the slaying of the black 17-year-old as a &quot;tragedy&quot; for all of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's legal problems, however, seemed far from over a day after a jury of six Florida women cleared him of manslaughter and second-degree murder charges - a verdict that stunned the black community and civil rights groups and spurred largely peaceful and protests in the streets in several U.S. cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury of six women accepted that Zimmerman had acted in self-defence when he shot and killed Martin as the teenager walked to his father's house in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., near Orlando, in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman had called the police after he spotted Trayvon at night, but ignored orders not to confront the teenager, who he believed was &quot;up to no good.&quot; A fight ensued, during which he shot Martin dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a mortgage underwriter described during the trial as a &quot;wannabe cop,&quot; smiled briefly after the verdict was read out and was hugged by his mother and father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who were at the heart of the campaign for justice for their son, chose not to be in court on Saturday evening and spent Sunday morning in church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, said on Twitter: &quot;Et tu America?&quot; The Justice Department said in a statement on Sunday that it's investigating Martin's death to determine whether federal prosecutors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman's been acquitted in the state case. The department launched a probe a year ago but stepped aside to allow Florida's prosecution to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents are also considering a wrongfuldeath civil suit against Zimmerman. Sixteen years ago, O.J. Simpson was ordered to pay $25 million US in compensation to Nicole Brown Simpson's family members despite his infamous acquittal in criminal court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was walking to his father's house carrying a can of iced tea and a box of Skittles when he was gunned down by Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer. Zimmerman claimed he shot the boy in self-defence when Martin attacked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country still smarting from a painful history of slavery and segregation,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">many saw overt racism in Zimmerman's focus on a black boy wearing a hoodie as he walked through a gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict, many argued this weekend, proves the criminal justice system is still inherently biased against black people given Martin, the unarmed slaying victim, was successfully portrayed as the aggressor in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a slap in the face to those that believe in justice in this country,&quot; said Rev. Al Sharpton, the Baptist minister and civil rights activist who helped to draw attention to the case after police initially released Zimmerman without charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What this jury has done is establish a precedent that when you are young and fit a certain profile, you can be committing no crime, just bringing some Skittles and iced tea home to your brother,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and be killed and someone can claim self-defence. I think that this is an atrocity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Jealous, president of the NAACP, said Sunday, &quot;There may be a civil action brought by the family, but there should definitely be criminal charges brought by (the Department of Justice).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we have asked DOJ to continue their investigation. They are indeed continuing, and we hope that once everything that's happened that can happen here in Florida ... that the DOJ will act and will hold Mr. Zimmerman accountable for what he has done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to level a hate crime charge, Jealous added, federal investigators need to &quot;show that race was a factor in his decision-making. And there seems to be plenty of evidence that suggests that race may have been a factor. He called 911 a lot about young black men that he suspected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of being dangerous.&quot; In a New York City church, one pastor wore a pink hoodie in memory of Martin on Sunday. The boy was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Jacqueline Lewis urged her congregation to remain peaceful, reminding them that Martin Luther King Jr. &quot;would have wanted us to conduct ourselves on the highest plane of dignity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she added: &quot;We're going to raise our voices against the root causes of this kind of tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Zimmerman Jr., the gunman's brother, said the former neighbourhood watch volunteer was still processing the reality that he wouldn't serve prison time for the killing, which Zimmerman, 29, maintained was an act of self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, with many critics angry over his acquittal, his freedom may be limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,&quot; Robert Zimmerman Jr. said during an interview on CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats called the outcome a miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans felt differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our justice system is colour-blind,&quot; Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said on CNN. &quot;You had two very capable teams laying out the evidence and the jury made the decision. Though there may be people on either side of this who don't agree with how it came out, we have the very best judicial system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iowa congressman Steve King, meantime, said Zimmerman should never have been charged at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I regret that this all happened. I'm sorry that it was turned into a race issue by the media,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
