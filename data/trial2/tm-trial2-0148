<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alec Baldwin has returned to Twitter to denounce George Zimmerman&quot;s acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star slammed the door on his account late last month after an explosive rant aimed at a journalist who had accused his wife of tweeting during James Gandolfini&quot;s funeral. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently the not guilty verdict announced at the weekend in Zimmerman&quot;s case was enough to prompt Baldwin&quot;s resurgence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star kept it brief when commenting on the outcome of the trial, which saw Zimmerman, 29, charged with second-degree murder in the death of an unarmed 17-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin was gunned down near his home in Sanford, Florida in February 2012 and the defendant, a Hispanic American, had been accused of racially profiling the teen, who was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida is a parallel universe. A f***ed up one.&quot; Baldwin wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His note came about 90 minutes after the verdict was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baldwin&quot;s previous rant was deleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star came under fire last month for what some called &quot;homophobic&quot; comments aimed at a male reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baldwin declared the MailOnline journalist a &quot;toxic little queen&quot; for erroneously reporting about his wife&quot;s alleged tweets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How much of this sh** are people supposed to take? With these f***ing blatant lies EVERY DAY,&quot; Baldwin tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My wife DID NOT use her phone, in any capacity, at our friends funeral. Now, f*** this twitter + good luck to all of you who know the truth (sic),&quot; he continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MailOnline later admitted to the error, blaming a &quot;Twitter bug&quot; in the website&quot;s timestamp system for the report.</SPAN></P>
