<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayor Bloomberg yesterday used the national fury over the verdict in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin shooting to push his anti-gun agenda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;One fact has long been crystal clear: 'Shoot first' laws, like those in Florida, can inspire dangerous vigilantism and protect those who act recklessly with guns,&quot; Hizzoner said in a statement that avoided mention of race in the controversial case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Such laws, drafted by gun-lobby extremists in Washington, encourage deadly confrontations by enabling people to shoot first and argue 'justifiable homicide' later,&quot; Bloomberg said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The tragic death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed child attempting to walk home from the store, will continue to drive our efforts&quot; to change those laws, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  City comptroller candidates Eliot Spitzer and Scott Stringer also blasted the Florida verdict that cleared neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman in the unarmed teen's death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stringer, at a Union Square rally denouncing the verdict, called the jury's decision &quot;madness.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It was sickening,&quot; he said. &quot;Being black and walking down the street is not a crime.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Spitzer, the former governor and attorney general, called the verdict &quot;a failure of justice.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;An innocent young man was walking down a street, was confronted by a stranger with a gun, and that innocent, young man was shot. The criminal-justice system should be able to deal with situations like that. It didn't,&quot; Spitzer said on ABC's &quot;This Week.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The city's mayoral candidates also made the rounds at churches to denounce the decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bill Thompson, the only African-American candidate, told reporters: &quot;It's not just Trayvon as a teenager. That could've been anybody who was black, anybody who was Latino.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, whose children are biracial, said the Justice Department should bring a civil case against Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;This is such a slap in the face to justice,&quot; he said during the Union Square protest.  </SPAN></P>
