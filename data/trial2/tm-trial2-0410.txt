MIAMI (AP) Police and city leaders in Florida say are preparing for the possibility of mass protests or even civil unrest if a neighborhood watch volunteer is acquitted in the killing of an unarmed black teen a case that has already provoked protests after police initially refused to arrest the defendant.
TrayvonMartin, 17, was visiting his father and father"s fiancee when George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, fatally shot him during a physical confrontation in a gated community in February 2012. 
Martin"s supporters portrayed the shooting as racially motivated, while Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, claimed self-defense. Charged with second-degree murder, Zimmerman is pleading not guilty at the trial unfolding in a Sanford courthouse.
After police failed to charge Zimmerman for 44 days, there were many large but peaceful protests in Florida as well as in New York and other cities. Those demonstrations included a mass walkout at nearly three dozen Florida high schools.
For months, Florida officials have been working with pastors, youth coaches, community activists and summer camp counselors to stress a non-violent approach if Zimmerman walks free. At the same time, police say they have quietly been making plans for dealing with any potential emotional flare-ups that could quickly turn into storefront-smashing, car-burning riots.
"It"s all right to be vocal, but we don"t want to be violent," said the Rev. Walter T. Richardson, a longtime pastor and chairman of Miami-Dade County"s Community Relations Board, which has been holding town hall-style meetings about the case. "We"ve already lost one soul and we don"t want to lose any more."
Many in Sanford say they doubt the trial"s outcome would spark local residents to take to the streets.
"The main focus was to get Zimmerman arrested and have him tried before a jury of his peers in a court of law," said Clayton Turner Jr., president of the Seminole County branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. "That was the main issue, not how we felt about whether he"s innocent or guilty."
Not everyone is so certain.
Shantree Hall, 37, who is black, said a Zimmerman acquittal might anger many in the African-American community who already feel they are less likely to obtain justice. The protests that led to Zimmerman"s arrest taught many people that was the only way to get things done, she added.
"With Trayvon, the noise was too loud for them. That"s why they couldn"t sweep it under the rug," she said.
Recent Miami-area high school graduate Jude Bruno, 18, said he doesn"t sense from friends and peers that there is a powder keg waiting to explode should Zimmerman be found not guilty. Bruno is chairman of the Miami-Dade County Youth Commission, which has been working with local youth groups to stress a peaceful reaction.
"We want to be the example to the world because the whole world is watching us," Bruno said.
Bruno spoke after a Community Relations Board meeting this week that drew several hundred people to a Miami Gardens library auditorium, some of them wearing "Justice for Trayvon" T-shirts and many asking sharp-edged questions about the trial. Still, the overall theme was peace.
"Please, no violence. We don"t want any violence. None," said Miriam Martin, one of TrayvonMartin"s aunts.
One potential advantage mentioned by several law enforcement officials: school is out for summer, meaning there is no ready-made rallying point for young people to gather.
Still, authorities are taking no chances, particularly in the Miami area which has had riots in the past connected to racially-charged court cases.
The worst rioting occurred in 1980 in the mostly-black Liberty City and Overtown neighborhoods of Miami, after four white police officers were acquitted in the death of Arthur McDuffie, a black Marine Corps veteran. McDuffie was beaten to death by police trying to stop him for a traffic violation. The three-day riot killed 18 people and did some $100 million in damage.
