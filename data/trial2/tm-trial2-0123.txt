PROTESTS erupted across the US yesterday after a neighbourhood watch volunteer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager was cleared of murder. 
Supporters of the 17-year-old victim TrayvonMartin's family yelled 'No! No!' outside a Florida court when the verdict was announced.
Flags were burnt and cars and windows smashed as marches were held in seven cities.
Police in Oakland, California, said they were dealing with 'acts of vandalism' following protests by about 100 people. There were reports of marchers damaging a police squad car and officers forming a line to block the protesters' path.
President Barack Obama called for calm last night, saying the death was a tragedy and America should seek ways to stem gun violence. 'We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken,' he said. 'I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.'
George Zimmerman was freed after he was found not guilty of all charges over the shooting of Trayvon in February last year. He said he acted in self-defence.
A jury considered nearly three weeks of conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor. The killing unleashed furious debate across the US over racial profiling and equal justice.
Prosecutors called the 29-year-old defendant a liar and 'wannabe cop' vigilante but defence lawyers said after his acquittal: 'George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defence.'
