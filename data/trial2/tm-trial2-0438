<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- &quot;Wannabe cop&quot; George Zimmerman wrongly profiled Trayvon Martin as a criminal, followed him with a gun and provoked him into a fight that resulted in the shooting death of the unarmed black teenager, a prosecutor said on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A teenager is dead,&quot; Florida state prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told the jury in closing arguments of Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial. &quot;He is dead through no fault of his own. He is dead because another man made assumptions.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense lawyers were due to present their closing arguments on Friday, followed by a final prosecution rebuttal, after which the jury would begin deliberating a case that has captivated and polarized much of the U.S. public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier on Thursday, Seminole County Judge Debra Nelson gave jurors the option of convicting Zimmerman of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Prosecutors wanted the sequestered, all-female jury to have the option of choosing a lesser offense that still carried a potentially lengthy sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense preferred an all-or-nothing choice of second-degree murder, confident it had shown Zimmerman acted in self-defense and concerned the jury might opt for what lead defense lawyer Mark O'Mara described as a &quot;compromise verdict.&quot;Pa. AG won't defend state in same-sex suit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILADELPHIA -- Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane refused on Thursday to fight a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawsuit is believed to be the first federal case since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on June 26 that the U.S. government must recognize same-sex marriages in states where it is legal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kane, a Democrat who supports same-sex marriage, announced her decision at a press conference in the National Constitution Center in historic Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are the land of the free and the home of the brave and I want to start acting like that,&quot; she said.Ill. governor suspends legislator pay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO -- The fight over fixing Illinois' pension liability has come down to this: Unable to forge a plan to solve the state's $100 billion pension underfunding, the governor is suspending legislators' $68,000-a-year paychecks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Pat Quinn on Wednesday used his line-item veto to eliminate salaries for state lawmakers from the fiscal 2014 budget. If the salaries indeed are cut, the move saves the state $1.15 million a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quinn, a Democrat, said he is also suspending his own salary until a pension bill hits his desk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor said lawmakers have pushed the state into a crisis by failing to resolve the public pension liability that has driven Illinois' credit rating to the lowest level among U.S. states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate President John Cullerton, a fellow Democrat, took Quinn to task, saying the work of a special legislative conference committee seeking a compromise solution on pensions should not be undermined or deterred by political grandstanding.Bomb, gun attacks across Iraq kill at least 44</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD -- Bombers and gunmen attacked policemen and a wake in Iraq among other targets, killing at least 44 people across the country on Thursday, in the latest burst of violence that has raised concerns about a return to civil strife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gunmen opened fire on two checkpoints guarding oil installations on the road between Haditha and Baiji, 111 miles north of the capital, killing 11 people, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the town of Muqdadiya, 11 more people were killed when a car bomb exploded at a wake. As survivors gathered to evacuate the wounded, a suicide bomber blew himself up, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was sitting inside the tentwhen I heard a huge explosion. I rushed out [and] saw a car burning. While we were busy evacuating the injured, a suicide bomber took us by surprise,&quot; said 47-year-old teacher Kadhim Hassan, who was taken to hospital with injuries to his leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence is part of a sustained campaign of militant attacks since the start of the year that has prompted warnings of wider conflict in a country where ethnic Kurds, Shiite and Sunni Muslims have yet to find a stable power-sharing compromise.</SPAN></P>
