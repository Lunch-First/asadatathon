OAKLAND -- Hundreds of demonstrators took over a section of Interstate 880 and marched through city streets chanting the name "Trayvon Martin" after nightfall as Oakland faced a third night of protests over the acquittal of Martin's killer, George Zimmerman, by a Florida jury. 
Traffic was stopped on the freeway for about 15 minutes Monday as protesters pored onto the on-ramps and fanned out through lanes of traffic.
Several demonstrators linked arms in front of motorists, while others chanted "If LA can do it, we can do it too." One officer shouted at them, "You've got to go. You will go to jail."
The freeway takeover, which mirrored a protest in Los Angeles on Sunday, began shortly after 7:15 p.m. and was over by 7:30 p.m. Police did not make mass arrests on the freeway, but reported that several protesters had been arrested throughout the night.
Protesters tried to take over a second freeway shortly before 9 p.m., but were blocked by police at the on-ramp to Interstate 580 at Lakeshore Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard.
