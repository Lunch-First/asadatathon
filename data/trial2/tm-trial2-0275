<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to Florida neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman being cleared of all charges in the much-publicized shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a group of Boulderites held a prayer vigil Sunday on the Pearl Street Mall.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Donald Matthews, a faculty member of religious studies at Naropa University, led the event. He said the gathering was intended to help the &quot;healing of the spirit of America.&quot;<BR><BR> About 35 people attended the vigil that was quickly organized by Matthews and Boulder resident Jen Watson.<BR><BR> &quot;This is a story of human tragedy,&quot; Matthews said. &quot;A young boy who was stalked and killed. It didn't have to happen.&quot;<BR><BR> Zimmerman was acquitted by a jury Saturday in the shooting of Martin, the unarmed black teenager whose killing has set off a debate about racial profiling. Zimmerman could have been convicted of second-degree murder or manslaughter.<BR><BR> In the aftermath of the Zimmerman verdict, Watson said to Matthews: &quot;This is outrageous.&quot;<BR><BR> Matthews responded: &quot;Outrageous is something the marginalized expect every day.&quot;<BR><BR> Watson and Matthews are spearheading a new community group to discuss - and work to better - race relations in Boulder.<BR><BR> &quot;One of the things I hope comes out of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case is that we will be more compassionate to one another,&quot; Matthews said.<BR><BR> As part of the vigil, Matthews read a poem he wrote for Martin: &quot;Racism was hungry the night you were shot. It is a beast must be fed its regular sacrifice of black, brown, yellow and poor white meat. It must be offered victims on the regular.&quot;<BR><BR> During the vigil, some in attendance took turns speaking.<BR><BR> &quot;I know I still live in a world where people are profiled,&quot; said Stuart Lord. &quot;There isn't a black man today who hasn't been profiled.&quot;<BR><BR> Catherine Ballance said, through tears, that as a mother she can't imagine the pain that Martin's mother is experiencing.<BR><BR> &quot;Not only to lose a son the way she did, but then to not have justice prevail,&quot; Ballance said.  </SPAN></P>
