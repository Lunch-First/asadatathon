The picture was allegedly taken by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and released only to the detainee's family. Confined to the basement of a CIA secret prison in Romania about a decade ago, Mohammed asked his jailers whether he could embark on an unusual project: Would the spy agency allow Mohammed, who had earned his bachelor's in mechanical engineering, to design a vacuum cleaner?
