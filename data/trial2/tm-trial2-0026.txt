A DAY after suggesting George Zimmerman could not escape street justice after being acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, Giants receiver Victor Cruz ran a reverse Sunday.
Cruz apologized for a Twitter post in which he said "Zimmerman doesn't last a year before the hood catches up to him." He quickly deleted it after backlash from followers Saturday night.
"I immediately realized my tweet was a mistake and I apologize, that's why I deleted it," he said in a series of Twitter messages. "I believe conversation not confrontation leads to change and progress."
