Americans angry at the acquittal of George Zimmerman over the death of black teenager Trayvon Martin marched in US cities, with reports of sporadic acts of violence.  
Spontaneous marches of varying sizes erupted in cities throughout Saturday night including San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, Atlanta and Philadelphia, AFP reported. A jury in Sanford, Florida late Saturday found Zimmerman, a volunteer neighborhood watchman, not guilty of shooting dead Martin, a 17 year-old unarmed teen on the night of February 26, 2012. The trial has riveted the nation for weeks, and emotions came to a boiling point as news of the verdict spread. Prominent rights activists like Jesse Jackson appealed for calm. "Avoid violence, it will lead to more tragedies. Find a way for self construction not deconstruction in this time of despair," he wrote on Twitter. Martin's parents have long called for non-violent demonstrations, quoting civil rights icon Martin Luther King and the Bible. Several hundred demonstrators marched peacefully amid a heavy police presence in downtown San Francisco soon after the verdict.
