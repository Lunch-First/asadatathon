<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Times-Union readers want to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I received an email with a photo of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin that says that &quot;little Trayvon&quot; at the time of his death stood almost 6-foot-2 and weighed 175 muscular pounds. Why did the media continue to show photos of the innocent-looking 12-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin instead of current ones?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of viral emails purport to show photos of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. PolitiFact.com, Snopes.com and TruthorFiction.com all looked into the images, as did other news organizations, and came to the same conclusion: Not the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One email, headlined &quot;Media Bias,&quot; shows a smiling, clean-cut, suit-wearing George Zimmerman - who shot Martin - next to a photo identified as Martin in saggy pants and making obscene gestures with both hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That email came from a posting on Twitchy.com, a website started by conservative columnist Michelle Malkin. The photo of Martin, though, was of a totally different Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, or someone who created a Facebook page with that name, according to various fact-finding groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twitchy.com did post a correction, which said, &quot;We made a mistake. The photo on the right is not of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin who was shot by Zimmerman. We apologize to our readers and the Martin family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The email also castigated the media for using a &quot;5-year-old&quot; photo of a smiling Martin wearing a red Hollister T-shirt. That photo, according to Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump, was taken in August 2011, seven months before Martin died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also posting supposed images of Martin was the website Stormfront, a neo-Nazi forum that describes itself as a &quot;community of racial realists and idealists.&quot; Business Insider picked up one of those &quot;gangsta&quot; images, then had to quickly retract and correct it, Columbia Journalism Review reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another viral email that has filled area inboxes over the past year has as its centerpiece a photo identified as Martin. The photo is of a young man with facial hair who is heavily tattooed. The email accuses the media of deceiving the public by using photos of a younger Martin, not detailing alleged disciplinary problems that Martin had in school and wanting to depict him as a &quot;sweet kid&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They don't show the up-to-date pictures of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, in the media. Now you know why. Kinda scary, ain't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not Martin, but a photo of Jayceon Terrell Taylor, a rapper from California who also goes by &quot;Game&quot; (formerly, &quot;The Game&quot;). Game received Grammy nominations in 2006 for his collaboration with rapper 50 Cent on &quot;Hate It or Love It,&quot; PolitiFact.com reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photo of Game was used in a May 6, 2010, story for XXL magazine, The Washington Post reported. Game was 31 years old at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TruthorFiction.com compared the tattoos in the photo with those on Game's album cover &quot;Leftovers,&quot; and found them to be the same. The fact-checking organizations wrote that Game was very outspoken about the shooting and was quoted in several articles accompanied by his photo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is possible that the originator of the chain email included the wrong photo on purpose, just as it is conceivable that the originator, seeing the photo of Game with an article on Martin, could have - in a quick read - confused one for the other.</SPAN></P>
