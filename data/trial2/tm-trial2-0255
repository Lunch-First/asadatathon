<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. (AP) - Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman was cleared of all charges Saturday in the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed black teenager whose killing unleashed furious debate across the U.S. over racial profiling, self-defense and equal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his Facebook page after the verdict was announced, Mayor Josh Cohen urged Annapolis residents to remain calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My earnest hope tonight is that those who are disheartened by the verdict will not channel their anger through violence, which accomplishes nothing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading activists in the local African-American community also urged calm, although they said the verdict raised issues about the fairness of the U.S. justice system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, blinked and barely smiled when the verdict was announced. He could have been convicted of second-degree murder or manslaughter. But the jury of six women, all but one of them white, reached a verdict of not guilty after deliberating well into the night Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's mother and father were not in the courtroom when the verdict was read; supporters of his family who had gathered outside yelled &quot;No! No!&quot; upon learning of the not guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors considered nearly three weeks of often wildly conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor on the rainy night the 17-year-old was shot while walking through the gated townhouse community where he was staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys said the case was classic self-defense, claiming Martin knocked Zimmerman down and was slamming the older man's head against the concrete sidewalk when Zimmerman fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors called Zimmerman a liar and portrayed him was a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; vigilante who had grown frustrated by break-ins in his neighborhood committed primarily by young black men. Zimmerman assumed Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands, prosecutors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Louis J. Boston, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Annapolis, said the reaction to the case has taken equality back another step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We work so hard to have a fair playing field, but we aren't there yet,&quot; Boston said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that at his church, he plans to dialogue open, foster learning and move forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This boy is dead,&quot; Boston said. &quot;He's not alive to tell his version of the story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County civil rights activist Carl O. Snowden said that as a lawyer he had thought a not-guilty verdict probable. He said that when he watched Zimmerman's acquittal on television, he wasn't sure how to react at first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The prosecutor had an uphill battle with this,&quot; Snowden said. &quot;From this decision, we have to learn from it and continue to talk about the importance of a fair justice system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowden said he and other civil rights activists will continue to fight for equality. He urged residents to remain calm while they process the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Violence won't help,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman defense attorney Mark O'Mara said his team was &quot;ecstatic&quot; about the verdict. &quot;George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another member of his defense team, Don West, said: &quot;I'm glad this jury kept this tragedy from becoming a travesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Attorney Angela Corey said after the verdict that she believed second-degree murder was the appropriate charge because Zimmerman's mindset &quot;fit the bill of second-degree murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We charged what we believed we could prove,&quot; Corey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the verdict drew near, police and city leaders in the Orlando suburb of Sanford and other parts of Florida said they were taking precautions against the possibility of mass protests or unrest in the event of an acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no party in this case who wants to see any violence,&quot; Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said immediately after jurors began deliberating. &quot;We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict came a year and a half after civil rights protesters angrily demanded Zimmerman be prosecuted. That anger appeared to return Saturday night outside the courthouse, at least for some who had been following the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosie Barron, 50, and Andrew Perkins, 55, both black residents of Sanford, stood in the parking lot of the courthouse and wept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I at least thought he was going to get something, something,&quot; Barron said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added her brother: &quot;How the hell did they find him not guilty?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perkins was so upset he was shaking. &quot;He killed somebody and got away with murder,&quot; Perkins shouted, looking in the direction of the courthouse. &quot;He ain't getting no probation or nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman wasn't arrested for 44 days after the Feb. 26, 2012, shooting as police in Sanford insisted that Florida's Stand Your Ground law on self-defense prohibited them from bringing charges. Florida gives people wide latitude to use deadly force if they fear death or bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents, along with civil rights leaders such as the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, argued that Zimmerman - whose father is white and whose mother is Hispanic - had racially profiled their son. And they accused investigators of dragging their feet because Martin was a black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before a special prosecutor assigned to the case ordered Zimmerman's arrest, thousands of protesters gathered in Sanford, Miami, New York and elsewhere, many wearing hoodies like the one Martin had on the night he died. They also carried Skittles and a can of iced tea, items Martin had in his pocket. President Barack Obama weighed in, saying that if he had a son, &quot;he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the racially charged nature of the case, race was barely mentioned at the trial. Even after the verdict, prosecutors said race was not about race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case has never been about race or the right to bear arms,&quot; Corey said. &quot;We believe this case all along was about boundaries, and George Zimmerman exceeded those boundaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One exception was the testimony of Rachel Jeantel, the Miami teen who was talking to Martin by phone moments before he was shot. She said he described being followed by a &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot; as he walked through the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeantel gave some of the trial's most riveting testimony. She said she overheard Martin demand, &quot;What are you following me for?&quot; and then yell, &quot;Get off! Get off!&quot; before his cellphone went dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors had to sort out clashing testimony from 56 witnesses in all, including police, neighbors, friends and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, witnesses who got fleeting glimpses of the fight in the darkness gave differing accounts of who was on top. And Martin's parents and Zimmerman's parents both claimed that the person heard screaming for help in the background of a neighbor's 911 call was their son. Numerous other relatives and friends weighed in, too, as the recording was played over and over in court. Zimmerman had cuts and scrapes on his face and the back of his head, but prosecutors suggested the injuries were not serious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To secure a second-degree murder conviction, prosecutors had to convince the jury that Zimmerman acted with a &quot;depraved&quot; state of mind - that is, with ill will, hatred or spite. Prosecutors said he demonstrated that when he muttered about &quot;punks&quot; who &quot;always get away&quot; during a call to police as he watched Martin walk through his neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors had to convince the jury only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification.</SPAN></P>
