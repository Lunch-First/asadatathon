<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After his acquittal on murder charges for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman may go to law school to help people wrongly accused of crimes such as himself, close friends told Reuters on Sunday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leanne Benjamin and her husband got to know Mr. Zimmerman in 2004 when he and a black friend opened up an insurance office in a Florida building where Ms. Benjamin worked. They grew close and the couple spent time with him during the trial. Over dinner with Mr. Zimmerman recently, Ms. Benjamin said, he told them he would like to go to law school. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'd like to help other people like me,&quot; she quoted him as telling them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Zimmerman, an insurance investigator, attended community college and was a credit shy of an associate's degree in criminal justice but was kicked out of school because he posed a danger to the campus, according to family sources. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Everybody said he was a cop-wannabe but he's interested in law,&quot; Ms. Benjamin said. &quot;He sees it as a potential path forward to help other people like himself.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Zimmerman's defence attorney Mark O'Mara agreed. &quot;He has a real interest in the law and ... prosecuting appropriately - not like what he got - is something he's very interested in. I will not be surprised if he ends up in criminal law,&quot; Mr. O'Mara said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;His dad was a judge, and he wants to be a prosecutor or a lawyer.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experience shows that re-building life after a major trial may prove difficult, even for those acquitted of headline-making crimes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Zimmerman's brother, Robert, said his life would never be the same after the trial, which has forced him to go out in disguise and wear bulletproof vests because of threats to his life. </SPAN></P>
