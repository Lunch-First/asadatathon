<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- Jurors have found George Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-member, all-woman jury deliberated for more than 15 hours over two days before reaching their decision Saturday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They had been given the chance to convict Zimmerman of manslaughter but did not do so, despite asking for a clarification of the charge earlier in the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing the verdict, Judge Debra Nelson told Zimmerman he was free to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors heard two different portraits of Zimmerman and had to decide whether he was a wannabe cop who took the law into his own hands or a well-meaning neighborhood watch volunteer who shot the unarmed teenager in self-defense because he feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
