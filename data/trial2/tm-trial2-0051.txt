Several hundred people rallied in Denver on Sunday to protest the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the Florida man who shot and killed TrayvonMartin.
"We will not erase the conversation of race," said Jeff Fard, founder of Brother Jeff's Cultural Center in Five Points. "Don't be afraid to say if TrayvonMartin was a white man, he would be alive today."
A jury Saturday found Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch leader in his Florida community, not guilty of second degree murder or manslaughter.
Zimmerman said he shot in self defense after the unarmed Martin, 17, attacked him.
Fard was joined by members of the Greater Metro Denver Ministerial Alliance, local officials and activists during the rally in front of the Martin Luther King memorial in City Park.
"We are here to pray, and we are here to stand for justice," state Rep. Angela Williams, D Denver, said.
Fard collected $1,644 from those in attendance that he said would be given to Martin's family to use for a civil lawsuit or anything else they needed.
Desiree Phillips, 37, who attended the rally with Thomas Johnson, said she began following the case in the days before Zimmerman was arrested. The verdict, she said, made her angry.
If Zimmerman had "done what the 911 operator asked him to do, (Martin) wouldn't have lost his life," Johnson, 50, said.
