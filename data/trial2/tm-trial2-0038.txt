POLICE in south Florida were last night considering activating contingency plans for possible riots after the George Zimmerman verdict.
Throughout the trial and since TrayvonMartin's death in February 2012, officials have been concerned about a potentially violent reaction to the verdict. 
Both Miami Dade officers and those in Sanford have been actively encouraging religious leaders to extol the power of peaceful demonstrations.
``I know that child was born and raised here in Miami and he got killed up in Sanford. But that is no reason for our young folk to get fired up and talk about bringing destruction on the city,'' one Miami pastor said.
``Riots are not acceptable. Riots are not expected,'' Miami Dade police chief JD Patterson said.
Miami police have gone beyond their Sanford counterparts and deemed two different parks as ``First Amendment zones'' -- places for people gather if they want to express their thoughts about the trial.
``We don't want people in places unplanned, spontaneously, voicing themselves in such a way that it brings up anger and hostility and violence,'' Mr Patterson said.
While the trial was going on in Sanford, police took a pre-emptive approach and went door-to-door warning residents about possible riots should the former Neighbourhood Watch member be acquitted.
As the verdict was announced, demonstrators outside the court chanted: ``Justice for Trayvon.''
Many on Twitter expressed their unhappiness. One user wrote: ``He might be free but he's a dead man walking.''
Some posted George Zimmerman's address, urging angry protesters to take action.
Celebrities including Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Mandy Moore and Nicki Minaj took to Twitter to criticise the court's verdict.
Members of the rap community were among the most outspoken.
Ice Cube tweeted: ``The TrayvonMartin verdict doesn't surprise me. Stanford, FL never wanted Zimmerman arrested. Now he's free to kill another child.''
