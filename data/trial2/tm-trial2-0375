<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SARASOTA - It was the boring part. The anger was at a low hum beneath the blast of the TV, playing at the volume's tinny threshold in this Sarasota barbershop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury rules blasted before the start of deliberations Friday in the murder trial of George Zimmerman, a courtroom drama that has captivated the nation, this state, this town, this shop in Newtown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brawny men with tattoos cut hair and argued, pointing their combs, above the noise and over the crowd of neighbors who came to watch. They joked about stealing Skittles and wearing hoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teithis Miller, a black 15-year-old with silver braces and a soft voice, kept to himself among them, waiting patiently for a haircut at Phatheadz Barbershop. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I kind of feel how it is,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I live in a neighborhood with a lot of white people, and they sometimes look at us like, 'What are you doing here?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miller lives in the Indian Beach neighborhood and is about to begin his freshman year at Booker High. To honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the 17-year-old who was shot and killed by Zimmerman, the teenager has blacked out his profile picture on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury could convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder or manslaughter in Martin's death or could acquit the defendant, who is claiming self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In defiant tones that ran counter to his reserved demeanor, Miller said he thought Zimmerman would be better served by a conviction. Because &quot;if he gets out, I think somebody is going to get him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a static but palpable anger in Sarasota's black community. The city's white leaders know it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Chief Bernadette DiPino has tried to pre-empt any potential for violence with calls for peaceful protest in the event of a Zimmerman acquittal. She stood near a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. in north Sarasota on Thursday and lit a candle for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other jurisdictions, including Bradenton, have taken precautions in lockstep with community and church leaders and are preparing for unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, it has become an American experience to expect outrcry in cases that draw such deep divisions along racial lines. So we wait, for the verdict and the tension to boil over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those tensions are especially weighty in communities where acrimony between police and minorities has been percolating for many years, as it has in Sarasota and other cities in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the level of animosity is high already, then there is more concern,&quot; said Ojmarrh Mitchell, an associate professor at the University of South Florida and an expert on race and crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitchell said he believes the Zimmerman case has gripped this country because of who Martin was - a normal kid who was unjustly profiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think with many young black people that resonates,&quot; he said. &quot;They've aroused suspicion, but haven't done anything wrong. Except in this case Trayvon is dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mitchell has noticed something else about this case:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went to a barbershop twice this week, once for me and once for my son, and both times it was on,&quot; he said. &quot;You know these are two different barbershops, and there was wall-to-wall coverage. I've never seen anything like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A different take</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol Krempel has feverishly followed the case since the night Martin was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krempel called her son, who owns Michael Urban Hair Studio, Friday morning to make sure he would have the trial playing when she came in for a 3 p.m. appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish I could be on the jury,&quot; Krempel said. &quot;I just think he's guilty. He didn't have to kill that young man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Krempel was able to stream CNN on his computer, but the jury had gone into deliberations prior to his mother's arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disappointed, Krempel just talked about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be riots if he's found innocent,&quot; Krempel said. &quot;If there are riots, somebody else will be hurt or killed, and it won't do any good. It won't change the verdict. George Zimmerman will have to be protected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of what the jury decides, Palmetto City Commissioner Charles Smith said the nation - and especially Florida - will feel the impact of this case long after it leaves the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict that comes out may be the biggest verdict in the history of Florida,&quot; he said. &quot;Racial profiling, gun rights, freedom of speech - all of that is tied to the Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;State laws will change. Gun laws will change. Security will be addressed. It will reshape the state of Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farther south, the Lanoue family discussed the case over a late lunch at Chili's on South Tamiami Trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know enough to have a real opinion,&quot; said Steve Lanoue. &quot;I don't know the details of all sides, and I never will because Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlene Lanoue said the family somehow ends up at the same restaurant during highly publicized trials: Casey Anthony, Jodi Arias. And now, George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could go either way,&quot; said Charlene, who has explained to their children that even though someone was killed, Zimmerman could be innocent by way of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlene said the African-American community has been very involved in publicizing the case, and she wonders how circumstances might have been different if the dead young man hadn't been black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will violence follow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carolyn Mason, a Sarasota county commissioner and longtime activist for the black community, was turned off by the police chief's message to the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the intention I think was good,&quot; Mason said, &quot;I think it was paternalistic. I think it was, in a way. I was a bit offended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mason is among a few leaders in North Sarasota who respond to crime scenes to coordinate community response and try to quell any possible anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 2012, Mason responded when Sarasota County deputies shot and killed Rodney Mitchell, a 23-year-old black man who had been pulled over for an alleged seatbelt violation. Mitchell tried to flee the scene, nearly hitting a deputy, the Sheriff's Office said. He was also unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trying to get the facts and get them to an angry group of onlookers, who were already spreading the word, Mason discovered at the scene that it was Mitchell - her nephew - who had been killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence was not an appropriate response, she urged. But after the shooting was ruled justified, and as the family continues a lawsuit against the county, she is still reminding people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there is a striking similarity in the basics of both cases,&quot; she said. &quot;I think the community is putting it together like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pastor Kelvin Lumpkin, also a leader in the black community, said he agrees that people are conflating the Zimmerman trial with lingering pain from Mitchell's shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he says the city's police chief made the right call in urging peace before the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what the chief did was good,&quot; Lumpkin said. &quot;Rodney Mitchell got killed last year, and there's still some open wounds there. There's still some lingering sense of injustice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
