<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An expert on gunshot wounds hired by the defence in an explosive American case has told a court a neighbourhood watch volunteer&quot;s account of how he fatally shot an unarmed black teen is consistent with the forensic evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Vincent Di Maio said the bullet&quot;s trajectory and gunpowder on Trayvon Martin&quot;s body support George Zimmerman&quot;s version that Martin was on top of him when Zimmerman fired his gun into Martin&quot;s chest. The gun&quot;s muzzle was against Martin&quot;s clothing and between 5cm and 10cm from Martin&quot;s skin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is consistent with Mr Zimmerman&quot;s account that Mr Martin was over him, leaning forward at the time he was shot,&quot; said Di Maio, the former chief medical examiner in San Antonio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pathologist also said it was likely Martin was conscious for 10 to 15 seconds after the shooting as a reserve supply of oxygen ran out of his body, and during that time it was possible for him to have moved his arms. Zimmerman&quot;s account that he had placed Martin&quot;s arms out to his sides after the shooting contradicts a photo taken after the shooting that shows Martin&quot;s arms under his body. Defence lawyers contend Martin moved his arms. Di Maio said cuts on the back of Zimmerman&quot;s head were consistent with his head striking a concrete pavement. Di Maio identified six separate impacts to Zimmerman&quot;s face and head. He said a nose injury could have come from being punched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said if clothes taken into evidence are wet and put in plastic bags, not paper bags, it can ruin the samples since &quot;bacteria multiplies and you get mould and it stinks to high heaven&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyers believe DNA evidence found on Martin&quot;s hooded sweatshirt and undershirt was degraded since the clothing wasn&quot;t packaged properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Debra Nelson postponed her decision on prosecutors&quot; request to bar the defence from showing animation depicting the fight between the pair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors object to the animation, saying it isn&quot;t an accurate depiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To recreate the fight, Daniel Schumaker said, he went to the crime scene and had employees in motion-capture suits re-enact what happened based on coroner photographs, police reports, the coroner&quot;s report, witness depositions and photos taken by responding police officers. The fight happened on a dark, rainy night in February last year and no eyewitnesses saw the entire fight. Several people saw and heard parts of the struggle that left Martin dead with a bullet in his heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testimony in previous days has focused on a police call that captures screams from the struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convincing the jury of who was screaming for help has become the main aim of prosecutors and defence lawyers because it would help jurors evaluate Zimmerman&quot;s self-defence claim. Relatives of both protagonists have offered conflicting opinions on who is screaming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s mother and uncle said last week it was Zimmerman screaming, while Martin&quot;s mother and brother also took the witness stand last Friday to say the voice belongs to Martin. Martin&quot;s father this week testified he initially couldn&quot;t tell if the screams came from his son, but later decided they did. Zimmerman said during a police interview the screams didn&quot;t sound like him, but he and his family later said the screams were his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has denied second-degree murder and says he shot Martin in self-defence during a scuffle in the townhouse complex where he lived. Martin was visiting his father and his father&quot;s fiancee.</SPAN></P>
