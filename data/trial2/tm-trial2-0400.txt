SANFORD: Jurors in the George Zimmerman murder trial will be told they can potentially convict him  for the lesser charge of manslaughter for the killing of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin. Jury deliberations in the closely watched case are expected to begin this afternoon,  and Mr Zimmerman faces up to life in prison if he is convicted of second-degree murder, the charge for which he was put on trial.
