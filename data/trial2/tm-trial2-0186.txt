OAKLAND -- Officers are responding to reports of a shooting on 78th Avenue near International Boulevard in East Oakland, authorities said. 
The Shotspotter gunshot-detection system alerted police to the shooting in the 1500 block of 78th Avenue around 8:09 p.m., police said. Two male victims were found with gunshot wounds.
Police did not immediately say where the victims were shot or how serious they injuries were. At least one person could be seen being loaded onto an ambulance on a live helicopter feed from television station ABC7.
The shooting took place as dozens of police officers followed hundreds of protesters walking through the streets from downtown Oakland toward Lake Merritt. The marchers were protesting the verdict in the Florida trial of George Zimmerman, who shot and killed teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012.
