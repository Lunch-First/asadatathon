<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alec Baldwin reactivated his Twitter account Saturday to comment on the acquittal of an accused murderer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star slammed the door on his account late last month after an explosive rant aimed at a journalist who had accused his wife of tweeting during James Gandolfini's funeral. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently the not guilty verdict announced Saturday in Zimmerman's case was enough to prompt Alec's resurgence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star kept it brief when commenting on the outcome of the trial, which saw Zimmerman, 29, charged with second-degree murder in the death of an unarmed 17-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin was gunned down near his home in Sanford, Florida in February 2012 and the defendant, a Hispanic American, had been accused of racially profiling the teen, who was black. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida is a parallel universe. A f**ked up one.&quot; Alec wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His note came about 90 minutes after the verdict was announced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alec's previous rant was deleted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star came under fire last month for what some called &quot;homophobic&quot; comments aimed at a male reporter. Alec declared the MailOnline journalist a &quot;toxic little queen&quot; for erroneously reporting about his wife's alleged tweets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How much of this sh*t are people supposed to take? With these f**king blatant lies EVERY DAY,&quot; Alec fumed. &quot;My wife DID NOT use her phone, in any capacity, at our friends funeral. Now, f**k this twitter + good luck to all of you who know the truth (sic),&quot; he continued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MailOnline later admitted to the error, blaming a &quot;Twitter bug&quot; in the website's timestamp system for the report.</SPAN></P>
