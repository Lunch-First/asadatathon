<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a jury acquits George Zimmerman of the racially charged 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, few local defense attorneys will be surprised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would be shocked if there wasn't an acquittal,&quot; said veteran defense attorney Michael Salnick. &quot;This case redefines reasonable doubt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce Reinhart, a former federal prosecutor, agreed. &quot;I don't think the state has made its case,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prevailing opinion among the defense bar was bolstered on Thursday when prosecutors in Sanford persuaded Seminole County Circuit Judge Debra Nelson to allow the six-member, all-female jury to also consider convicting Zimmerman of manslaughter -- not just second-degree murder -- when it begins deliberations today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The prosecution is seeking the lesser-included offense because they don't think the case went well for them and they think they have a better chance of getting a conviction if they give the jury the option of the lesser offense,&quot; said attorney Richard Lubin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although such requests are routine, they typically come from the defense, most attorneys said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The phrase we use is, 'Hopefully, the jury will split the baby,'&quot; said attorney Craig Lawson. &quot;If you give a jury a choice, maybe they'll convict your client of the lesser offense. It's a trade-off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The so-called compromise verdict is something Zimmerman's attorneys said they wanted to avoid. They argued vehemently that the jury be allowed to consider only second-degree murder -- nothing else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What George did was an intentional act, that he knew he was pulling the trigger. The reason why he did it was self-defense, and that doesn't suggest the manslaughter charge would be appropriate,&quot; Mark O'Mara, Zimmerman's lead attorney, told reporters after resting his case Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Self-defense claim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salnick said the state is playing games. &quot;The prosecution is hoping something will stick to the wall,&quot; he said. &quot;If the prosecution was doing what it's supposed to do, and that's seeking justice, it should be an up-or-down decision on second-degree murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder, a charge that could send him to prison for life, jurors must be convinced that he acted with &quot;ill will, hatred or spite.&quot; To convict him of manslaughter, which carries a maximum 30-year sentence because it involved a firearm, jurors must decide only that he showed reckless indifference to human life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real problem for prosecutors is that Zimmerman is claiming he acted in self-defense, said Palm Beach County Assistant State Attorney Craig Williams. &quot;Hands down it's the best defense a defendant can raise,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the accused raises other defenses, like false identification or that he was out of town when the crime occurred, he has to prove his claims. However, if a person insists they acted in self-defense, it is up to prosecutors to disprove it. &quot;We have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not act in self-defense,&quot; Williams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he hasn't followed the case closely, other prosecutors told him that they share the views of their courtroom adversaries. &quot;The state has a weak case,&quot; Williams said, quoting co-workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lack of witnesses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman claims the unarmed Martin attacked him when he confronted the teen who was walking back to the home of his father's fianc&eacute;e after buying Skittles and iced tea at a convenience store near the gated townhouse community where Zimmerman lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With no eyewitnesses to refute Zimmerman's claims, it is difficult to prove that he acted with ill will, hatred or spite, Williams said. If someone had heard Zimmerman yelling racial epithets at Martin before the two tussled in the dark, prosecutors would have the ammunition they needed for a second-degree murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's just no witness to testify to any of this stuff,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reinhart agreed. &quot;The whole issue in this case -- the one and only issue -- is who started the fight,&quot; he said. Since no one witnessed the confrontation, jurors are left to decide whether or not to believe Zimmerman's explanation of what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reinhart said he understands the public pressure, the howls of racism that pushed prosecutors to pursue charges against Zimmerman after Sanford police initially cleared him of wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if it were me -- and these are all big ifs -- if after looking at the evidence and seeing what they had, I would have walked away from it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawson said as a lawyer he shares some of the same concerns. But, he said, as a black man it's difficult not to believe Martin is dead simply because of his race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once Zimmerman started to profile this guy, saying he was wearing a hoodie, had no business in the neighborhood and was acting suspicious,&quot; he said of initial calls Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, made to police before he decided to confront Martin. &quot;You just wonder, would he have done it if he were a white teenager?&quot;</SPAN></P>
