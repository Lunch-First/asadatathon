<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict in the George Zimmerman trial elicited a heated  response Saturday night from New York Giants wide receiver and  Lyndhurst resident Victor Cruz, who hinted that Zimmerman's life  may be in danger as a result of his acquittal in the slaying of  Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Cruz, a Paterson native who recently signed a $43 million contract,  posted on his Twitter account: &quot;Thoroughly confused. Zimmerman  doesn't last a year before the hood catches up to him.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz deleted his tweet, but not before numerous people saved the  image and fanned it across social media.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    He then sent a series of Twitter messages Sunday apologizing for  the statement and expanding on his feelings about the case:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;My tweet last night was my initial interpretation of the reaction  I was reading on Twitter. I immediately realized my tweet was a  mistake and I apologize, that's why I deleted it. I believe  conversation, not confrontation, leads to change and progress.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I never have and never will advocate violence under any  circumstances and I pray that we all encourage and educate each  other,&quot; Cruz continued. &quot;The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is an  unthinkable tragedy that is any parent's worst nightmare. As a  father, I want my daughter to grow up in a country that uses this  tragedy to heal and grow and progress. My prayers continue to go  out to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
