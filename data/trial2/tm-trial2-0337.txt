SANFORD, Fla. - At 2:30 p.m. Friday, six women rose from their seats in Courtroom 5D here and slipped into a back room where they will decide a case that has transfixed the country. 
A key piece of evidence will go to the same back room: the Kel-Tec 9 mm handgun that neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman used to kill teenager Trayvon Martin.
Jurors will consider charges of second-degree murder, which requires prosecutors to prove Zimmerman had a "depraved mind" and "ill intent," and the lesser offense of manslaughter. But Judge Debra Nelson blocked a prosecution attempt to add the option of a third-degree murder charge based on the claim that Zimmerman committed child abuse since Martin was a minor.
Late Friday afternoon, the jurors asked the judge for an index of all the evidence, the Associated Press reported.
Their deliberations began not long after Zimmerman's defense attorney told jurors that much still isn't known about what happened on that dark, rainy night in February 2012.
Speaking in a soothing, conversational tone, attorney Mark O'Mara urged jurors not to make assumptions about the defendant accused of killing Martin and not to try to "fill in blanks" or "connect dots."
The only conclusion jurors could reach about his client after hearing testimony for three weeks, O'Mara said, is "innocence. Pure, unadulterated innocence."
Minutes into his closing argument, O'Mara walked over to the defense table, and Zimmerman, dressed in a dark blazer and tie, stood. The defendant held his head high and gazed directly at the jury with a neutral expression on his face.
O'Mara placed his hand on the shoulder of Zimmerman, a humanizing gesture. O'Mara's demeanor contrasted with the style of assistant state attorney Bernie de la Rionda, who often shouted and spoke in impassioned tones during prosecution closing arguments on Thursday.
