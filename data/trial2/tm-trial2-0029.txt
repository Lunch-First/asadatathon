FROM HARLEM to Times Square to downtown Brooklyn, New Yorkers vented outrage at a Florida jury they said let TrayvonMartin's killer get away with murder. 
A day after George Zimmerman was found not guilty of gunning down the unarmed teen, politicians, preachers and protesters were united in the opinion that justice was denied.
"I really want this to be about Trayvon," Solange Knowles, sister of Beyonc, told protesters at a rally she organized at Brooklyn Borough Hall.
Thousands gathered in Union Square and marched toward Times Square, chanting, "No justice, no peace."
"We are venting our frustration," said Daniel Maree, who helped organize the rally.
Councilman Jumaane Williams (D-Brooklyn) said the verdict sends a message that it's "difficult to be a black man in 2013."
The rally drew Democratic mayoral candidates John Liu and Bill de Blasio, who both condemned the verdict. De Blasio and other protesters called on the federal Department of Justice to bring civil rights charges against Zimmerman.
And earlier in the day, the Rev. Nicholas Richards sermonized from the pulpit at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem: "Every generation has its own evil. But our evil is a different kind of evil - our systems are evil."
