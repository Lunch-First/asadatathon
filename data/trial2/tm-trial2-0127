<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York, Boston, San Francisco and other cities saw loud rallies and marches demanding &quot;Justice for Trayvon.&quot; Thousands demonstrated in New York's Union Square on Sunday evening. About 2,000 of the demonstrators then marched on Times Square, stopping traffic as they zigzagged through the streets to avoid police lines.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police tried and failed to funnel the crowd into controlled lanes. They managed to halt the march near the square but demonstrators forced their way around, with about 1,000 staging a sit-in at Times Square. In San Francisco and Los Angeles - where police had broken up an earlier protest with beanbag rounds - officers closed streets as protesters marched to condemn Mr Zimmerman's acquittal. Hours after the verdict, demonstrators gathered in Washington chanting: &quot;No justice, no peace&quot; and carrying signs that read: &quot;Stop criminalising black men.&quot; The Los Angeles protest stopped traffic for about 25 minutes, prompting police to issue a citywide tactical alert. In Boston about 500 racially mixed protesters left their demonstration site in the Roxbury neighbourhood and started marching in the streets alongside police escorts on motorcycles and on foot. Demonstrators raised signs saying: &quot;We Demand Justice,&quot; &quot;Stop Racial Profiling&quot; and &quot;Never Forget. Never Again. Justice for Trayvon.&quot; Over 500 people rallied on the streets of San Francisco, some carrying yellow signs with Mr Martin's photo. About a dozen police motorcycles and vans trailed the group of marchers, who banged on drums as they walked and continuously chanted: &quot;Justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; Justice Department officials said it was considering whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Mr Zimmerman had been acquitted. President Barack Obama called the death of 17-year-old Mr Martin a tragedy for the country and urged calm.</SPAN></P>
