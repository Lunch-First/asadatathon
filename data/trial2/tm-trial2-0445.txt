WANNA-BE COP George Zimmerman opted not to take the stand Wednesday as the defense rested in his second-degree murder trial.
"No," Zimmerman replied when Judge Debra Nelson asked him if he intended to testify in his own behalf. 
"Yes," he answered when the judge asked if this was his final decision.
With that, defense attorney Mark O'Mara asked Nelson once again to acquit Zimmerman, arguing that prosecutors failed to prove he deliberately killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.
Nelson said no and that she would leave it for the jury to decide 29-year-old Zimmerman's fate.
The jurors could get the case as early as Friday, after both sides make their closing arguments in a racially charged case that has transfixed much of the country.
Prosecutors contend Zimmerman is a vigilante who profiled Martin and tailed him against a dispatcher's advice before killing the unarmed black teenager.
They say Zimmerman, who ran the neighborhood watch at the townhouse complex outside Orlando, was frustrated over a recent rash of break-ins and over his thwarted career as a police officer.
Zimmerman's lawyers say he shot Martin in the chest in self-defense after the teen jumped him and began pounding his head on the sidewalk.
In one of the most surreal moments of the trial, O'Mara straddled a life-sized dummy Wednesday and smashed its head on the courtroom floor while the jury looked on.
"Would the injuries on Mr. Zimmerman, the back of his head, be consistent with someone doing this on cement?" O'Mara asked John Root, a public safety consultant who was on the stand.
Then O'Mara slammed the dummy's flopping head on the floor.
"I don't think so," Root replied.
"How about this?" O'Mara asked. "How about someone resisting the attack? Could that have come from if someone was resisting me pushing down like this?"
"I believe so," Root said.
