<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford (US): A six-woman jury has found a neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering an unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, in a racially charged trial that has transfixed the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing Martin through a gated community in Sanford, Florida, and shooting him during an altercation. Defence lawyers insisted Zimmerman acted in self-defence after Martin (17) wrestled him to the ground and started bashing his head into the pavement.<BR><BR>The February 2012 killing ignited widespread controversy after police initially declined to press charges against Zimmerman. Martin had no criminal record and was on a snack run, returning to the house where he was staying as a guest.<BR><BR>Zimmerman was arrested only after civil rights leaders championed the case and demonstrators marched to demand action.<BR><BR>The case began as a routine homicide but soon evolved into a civil rights cause examining racial profiling and its consequences - an issue barred from the courtroom - and setting off a broad discussion of race relations in America.<BR><BR>Even President Obama, after the shooting, had expressed sympathy for the dead teenager's family and urged a thorough investigation. &quot;If I had a son,&quot; Obama said, &quot;he'd look like Martin.&quot;<BR><BR>Outside the courthouse, a hundred protesters who had been gathering through the night, their numbers building as the hours passed, began pumping their fists in the air, waving placards and chanting, &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot;</SPAN></P>
