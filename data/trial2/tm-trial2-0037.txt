GEORGE Zimmerman may have been acquitted of the killing of Trayvon Martin, but he is now ``a dead man walking''. 
Mr Zimmerman was forced into hiding after receiving hundreds, perhaps thousands, of death threats after he was identified as the man who shot dead the unarmed 17-year-old in February 2012.
Now he is a free man but his lawyers said he must stay in hiding because ``several fringe groups'' refused to accept the jury's verdict that Mr Zimmerman acted within the law when he killed Mr Martin.
While the case forced Florida Governor Rick Brown to establish a panel to review Florida's Stand Your Ground law -- the statute that allows anyone to use deadly force if he has a reasonable fear of death or grave bodily injury -- the panel recommended no major changes. Lawyers and consultants who have worked in similar cases said Mr Zimmerman's life would not return to normal any time soon.
He should, they added, abandon his ambitions of becoming a police officer because his reputation has become far too divisive.
``This is something that will follow George Zimmerman forever,'' defence lawyer Don West said at a press conference shortly after the verdict.
