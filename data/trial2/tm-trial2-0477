<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. (AP) - A central Florida judge ruled Wednesday that Trayvon Martin's cellphone texts on fighting and a defense animation depicting the fight between Martin and George Zimmerman won't be introduced as evidence at Zimmerman's trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Debra Nelson made her ruling Wednesday, a day after she heard arguments on the matter. Prosecutors had claimed the texts were irrelevant and taken out of context. They also objected to the computer animation, questioning its accuracy and saying it would mislead jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a murder trial. This isn't 'Casablanca.' This isn't 'Iron Man,'&quot; prosecutor Richard Mantei said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge seemed concerned about the animation's accuracy during arguments. While the animation can't be introduced as evidence that can be reviewed by jurors during their deliberations, defense attorneys may be able to use it during closing arguments, she ruled.</SPAN></P>
