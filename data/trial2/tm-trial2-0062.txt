POLICE were last night on alert for a backlash in US cities after a jury cleared a man of shooting dead a black teenager.
Neighbourhood watch member George Zimmerman killed 17-yearold TrayvonMartin as the unarmed youngster was walking home through a gated community at night. 
Zimmerman, 29, claimed he fired in self-defence after being attacked by the teenager, while critics branded him a "wannabe cop".
The Florida killing polarised American society down racial lines after police waited six weeks before arresting Zimmerman, with President Barack Obama declaring that if he had a son, "he'd look like Trayvon".
Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder and also manslaughter by a jury of six women following a televised trial at a Florida courthouse.
The verdict drew jeers from crowds outside the court building, while peaceful protests took place in Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington.
In Oakland, California, marchers vandalised a police car and tried to start fires in the street.
Trayvon died in Sanford, a town of 54,000 people on the outskirts of Orlando, in February last year. The teenager, who studied aviation and dreamed of becoming a pilot or engineer, died from a single gunshot wound to the heart.
Moments before the shooting, Zimmerman, armed with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol, called police to say he had spotted a suspicious figure in the neighbourhood.
Andrew Perkins, 55, a black resident of Sanford, angrily asked outside the courthouse: "How the hell did they find him not guilty? "He killed somebody and got away with murder."
In an effort to defuse tensions, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson tweeted his despair at the decision, But he added: "Avoid violence, it will lead to more tragedies."
Fellow anti-racism activist Rev Al Sharpton said the verdict was "a slap in the face to the American people".
