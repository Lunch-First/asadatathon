JURORS have found neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of murder in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old black teenager Trayvon Martin.
The jury deliberated for over 15 hours over two days in Florida before reaching their decision.
They had been given the chance to convict Mr Zimmerman (pictured) of manslaughter but did not do so, despite asking for a clarification of the charge.
Jurors heard two different portraits of Mr Zimmerman and had to decide whether he was a wannabe cop who took the law into his own hands or a well-meaning neighbourhood watch volunteer who shot the unarmed teenager in self-defence because he feared for his life.
