UNITED SATES:  Outrage over the  acquittal of George Zimmerman after the shooting of  unarmed black  teenager TrayvonMartin sparked street protests and  calls for justice for the victim. 
In New York, hundreds of protesters marched into Times Square last night, chanting: "Justice for TrayvonMartin."
In San Francisco and Los Angeles police closed streets as  protesters marched to condemn Mr Zimmerman's acquittal.
Zimmerman admitted killing the teenager but claimed he had done so in self-defence.
Civil rights leaders, including Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, urged peace in the wake of the verdict.
The 29-year-old neighbourhood watch volunteer had faced charges of second-degree  murder and manslaughter due to his fatal shooting of the 17-year-old last year. 
A jury found Zimmerman not guilty.
Mr Martin's killing in February 2012 unleashed furious debate across the US over  racial profiling, self- defence and equal justice.
Protesters across the country lashed out against police in the Orlando suburb of Sanford, outraged that it took 44 days for Mr Zimmerman to be arrested.
