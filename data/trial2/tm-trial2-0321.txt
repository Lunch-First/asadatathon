A Florida jury yesterday resumed deliberating the fate of George Zimmerman, 29, in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, 17, in 2012, a case that has triggered debate in the US for more than a year. 
The jury of six women, sequestered since the trial began last month, deliberated for more than three hours on Friday without reaching a decision. They must reach a unanimous verdict.
Zimmerman says he shot the teen in self-defence under Florida's "Stand Your Ground" law.
