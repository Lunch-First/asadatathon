<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- Hundreds of demonstrators took over a section of Interstate 880 and marched through city streets chanting the name &quot;Trayvon Martin&quot; after nightfall as Oakland faced a third night of protests over the acquittal of Martin's killer, George Zimmerman, by a Florida jury. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traffic was stopped on the freeway for about 15 minutes Monday as protesters pored onto the on-ramps and fanned out through lanes of traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several demonstrators linked arms in front of motorists, while others chanted &quot;If LA can do it, we can do it too.&quot; One officer shouted at them, &quot;You've got to go. You will go to jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The freeway takeover, which mirrored a protest in Los Angeles on Sunday, began shortly after 7:15 p.m. and was over by 7:30 p.m. Police did not make mass arrests on the freeway, but reported that several protesters had been arrested throughout the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters tried to take over a second freeway shortly before 9 p.m., but were blocked by police at the on-ramp to Interstate 580 at Lakeshore Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
