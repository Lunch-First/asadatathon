<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WITH POLICE and civic leaders urging calm, a jury has started deliberating George Zimmerman's fate after hearing duelling portraits of the neighbourhood watch captain: a cop wannabe who took the law into his own hands or a well-meaning volunteer who shot unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin because he feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the jury got the murder case, police in this Orlando suburb went on national television to plead for peace in Sanford, Florida, and across America, no matter what the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no party in this case who wants to see any violence,&quot; Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said. &quot;We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were big protests in Sanford and other cities across America last year when authorities waited 44 days before arresting Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a dozen protesters, most of them from outside central Florida, gathered outside the courthouse as the jury deliberated. Martin supporters outnumbered those for Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During closing arguments, Zimmerman's lawyers put a concrete slab and two life-size cardboard cutouts in front of the jury box in one last attempt to convince the panel Zimmerman shot the unarmed black 17-year-old in self- defence while his head was being slammed against the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Mark O'Mara used the slab to make the point that it could serve as a weapon. He showed the cutouts of Zimmerman and Martin to demonstrate that the teenager was considerably taller. And he displayed a computer-animated depiction of the fight based on Zimmerman's account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said prosecutors hadn't met their burden of proving Zimmerman's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, he said, the case was built on &quot;could've beens&quot; and &quot;maybes&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it hasn't been proven, it's just not there,&quot; O'Mara said. &quot;You can't fill in the gaps. You can't connect the dots. You're not allowed to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a rebuttal, prosecutor John Guy accused Zimmerman of telling &quot;so many lies&quot;. He said Martin's last emotion was fear as Zimmerman followed him through the gated townhouse community on the rainy night of February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that every child's worst nightmare, to be followed on the way home in the dark by a stranger?&quot; Guy said. &quot;Isn't that every child's worst fear?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sequestered jury of six women - all but one of them white - will have to sort through a lot of conflicting testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors deliberated for three-and-a- half hours before stopping on Friday evening. They will resume deliberations on Saturday morning. Zimmerman, 29, is charged with second-degree murder, but the jury will also be allowed to consider manslaughter. Under Florida's laws involving gun crimes, manslaughter could end up carrying a penalty as heavy as the one for second- degree murder: life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge's decision to allow the jury to consider manslaughter was a potentially heavy blow to the defence: It could give jurors who aren't convinced the shooting amounted to murder a way to hold Zimmerman responsible for the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors must show only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara dismissed the prosecution's contention that Zimmerman was a &quot;crazy guy&quot; patrolling his townhouse complex and &quot;looking for people to harass&quot; when he saw Martin. O'Mara also disputed prosecutors' claim that Zimmerman snapped when he saw Martin because there had been a rash of break-ins in the area, mostly by young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer said Zimmerman at no point showed ill will, hatred or spite during his confrontation with Martin - which is what prosecutors must prove for second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, prosecutors argued Zimmerman showed ill will when he whispered profanities to a police dispatcher over his cellphone while following Martin through the neighbourhood. They said Zimmerman &quot;profiled&quot; the teenager as a criminal.</SPAN></P>
