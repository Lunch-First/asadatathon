<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W. Kamau Bell isn't comfortable revealing his age. &quot;It's not a big deal,&quot; the comic and social critic recently said on the phone from New York. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not hiding my age. . . . I'm not worried about it.&quot; So how old is he? He doesn't say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, who is cocreator and host of FX's topical comedy show Totally Biased With W. Kamau Bell, will be in town for a night of stand-up Friday at Prince Music Theater in Center City. The 8 p.m. show also will feature Janine Brito, Kevin Kataoka, and Aparna Nancherla.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cocreated by Chris Rock, Totally Biased blends elements of stand-up, news commentary, and talk show. It was launched to critical and popular acclaim in September 2012 as a weekly show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such has been the praise that when it returns in September, it will be revamped as a nightly show on FX's new sister channel, FXX. (It'll be on at 11 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, with a weekly best-of compilation Sunday nights, also at 11.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was gracious on the phone. Funny, relaxed, but also reflective. He wondered if it's useful for reporters to refer to him simply as a comic or as an African American comic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing's for sure: He pays attention to the news, which he dissects on his show with nimble mind- and lingo-power. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think of him as a cross between Keith Olbermann (he's not afraid to express outrage at political stupidity) and Chris Rock (he's got a rare ear for language and great comic timing). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's work first came to prominence in 2010 with his one-man show The W. Kamau Bell Curve: Ending Racism in About an Hour. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics dubbed him one of the country's best political comedians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was nonplussed by the label. &quot;Every time a black man has an opinion, he's a political activist,&quot; he joked. &quot;I was anointed a political comedian because I was doing jokes about the guy who's running for president. So I was told, 'Hey, well you are a political comedian.' &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's observational comedy is political in the larger sense, hitting on such issues as race, poverty, and terrorism. &quot;I feel the word sociopolitical fits better - how society is inter-connected,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell traces his interest in politics, especially race relations, to his family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like it was always part of the discussion in my house,&quot; he said. &quot;Every month was Black History Month at our house.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell grew up in Alabama and Chicago, the son of Walter Bell, a self-made man who rose from bank teller and insurance salesman to become Alabama's insurance commissioner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother is author and memoirist Janet Cheatham Bell, who began her career in the school textbook industry in Boston before founding a self-publishing firm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why did they name him Kamau? &quot;It's a Kenyan name, but I'm not sure if that's even their heritage,&quot; Bell said. &quot;I was born at a point when black people felt the revolution was coming, so they named their kids after African names.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell graduated from the prestigious University of Chicago Laboratory Schools before moving to Philly to attend Penn. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though he misses the city, and Wawa hoagies, Bell didn't exactly fall in love with Penn, and left after three semesters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My major was East Asian studies,&quot; he said, &quot;because I was really into Bruce Lee. That was my first mistake.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell felt like an outsider because &quot;there was no real vital arts scene&quot; at Penn. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just realized this is not my place, this is not my scene,&quot; he said. He moved to Los Angeles and threw himself into comedy, building up an impressive resum&amp;eacute;: He cofounded the collective Laughter Against the Machine; cohosts a podcast with Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid called The Field Negro Guide to Arts &amp; Culture, and released two albums, including 2010's Face Full of Flour. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The success of The W. Kamau Bell Curve put him on the map. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Rock came calling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He saw the show in New York and called me a few weeks later and said, 'I want to help you get a TV show,' &quot; Bell said. &quot;I was like, Yeah? . . . Yeah!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show spelled a life chance for Bell, who was married, with a baby. His wife Melissa is working on a Ph.D. in contemporary dance theory. Their daughter, Sami, is now 2. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Totally Biased premiered during the 2012 election season, which gave Bell, an avowed liberal, plenty of material. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he tries to show there is bias in all reporting. &quot;It's bias if one story gets more attention than others,&quot; he said. We need to start asking tough questions about the media, he said. Such as why celebrities get more coverage than some wars. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or why did the Paula Deen scandal get equal footing with the murder trial of George Zimmerman for shooting Trayvon Martin?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both were given a lot of attention, which creates this false equivalency,&quot; Bell said. &quot;I think my job as a commentator is to point this out.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added the comic, &quot;If Deen called me every day and dropped an N-bomb with me and no kid died in that process, I would be perfectly happy. We don't need to be covering Deen. There's real news out there.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  W. Kamau Bell: &quot;The Totally Biased Stand-Up Tour&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8 p.m. Friday at Prince Music Theater, 1412 Chestnut St. Tickets: $22.50, $25. Ages 18 and up. Information: 215-893-1999 or www.princemusictheater.org</SPAN></P>
