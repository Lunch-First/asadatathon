George Zimmerman
Zimmerman, 29, was a neighborhood watch volunteer at his Sanford, Fla., gated community when he fatally shot TrayvonMartin on Feb. 26, 2012. Zimmerman is of white and Latino heritage - his mother is Peruvian - something friends and relatives have cited to rebut allegations that he racially profiled Martin, who was black. Zimmerman had a legal permit to carry the gun he used, and he said he fired in self-defense after Martin attacked him. 
TrayvonMartin
Martin was 17 when Zimmerman shot and killed him. His parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, divorced when he was a child, and he was living in Miami Gardens, Fla., with his mother and brother. He was visiting his father in Sanford when he encountered Zimmerman.
Mark O'Mara
O'Mara is Zimmerman's lawyer. A criminal and family law attorney in central Florida for 28 years, he is a former felony prosecutor and has extensive trial experience in state and federal criminal defense.
Bernie de la Rionda
De la Rionda is the assistant state attorney who presented the prosecution's case against Zimmerman. He was selected by the special prosecutor in the case, Angela Corey. She had been appointed by Florida Gov. Rick Scott to investigate Martin's shooting following protests over the Sanford Police Department's failure to arrest Zimmerman.
Debra Nelson
Nelson is the Seminole County judge who presided in the case. According to her online biography, Nelson was admitted to the Florida and Texas bars in 1979 and was appointed to the bench in 1999. She was assigned the case in August after the previous judge stepped aside amid allegations that statements he had made could be interpreted to indicate bias against Zimmerman.
