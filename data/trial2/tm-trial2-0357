<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six anonymous women began deliberating on Friday whether to convict George Zimmerman for the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in a case that has captivated and divided the U.S. public for the past 16 months.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After presiding over 12 days of testimony and two days of closing arguments, Seminole County Judge Debra Nelson turned the case over to a jury sequestered since the trial began last month. They broke for the day Friday without reaching a verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They will try to settle a case that has dominated U.S. media, sparked street demonstrations and raised questions about race and guns in America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jurors must reach a unanimous verdict on either second-degree murder, manslaughter or acquittal. A deadlocked jury would result in a mistrial, possibly leading to the whole courtroom drama unfolding once again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Zimmerman, 29, says he shot Mr. Martin in self-defence after he was attacked on the rainy night of Feb. 26, 2012, in the central Florida town of Sanford. Prosecutors contend Mr. Zimmerman was a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; who tracked down the teenager and shot him without justification. Mr. Zimmerman's family appealed for calm, whatever the verdict, saying they had complete trust in the U.S. justice system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As we await a verdict we will remain hopeful and ask for the public to remain peaceful no matter the outcome,&quot; they said in a statement to CNN. &quot;The judicial system has run its course, pray for justice, pray for peace, pray for our country.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In closing arguments on Friday, lead defence lawyer Mark O'Mara attempted to shift the blame to Mr. Martin, saying he was the aggressor who attacked Mr. Zimmerman after lying in wait. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To convict Mr. Zimmerman of second-degree murder, which could lead to a sentence of life in prison, the jury must find he acted with ill will, spite or hatred. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The jury can also opt for manslaughter, which has a lesser burden of culpable negligence. That carries a prison sentence of up to 30 years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prosecutors had one final rebuttal, when John Guy told the jury: &quot;The defendant didn't shoot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because he had to. He shot him because he wanted to. That's the bottom line.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When police initially declined to arrest Mr. Zimmerman, believing his account of self-defence, it provoked demonstrations, first in Sanford's black neighbourhood of Goldsboro, where people accused Mr. Zimmerman of racial profiling and demanded his arrest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protests spread to small towns and big cities across the United States, prompting celebrity tweets, cable news shouting matches and scrutiny of Florida's Stand Your Ground self-defence law, which police cited in letting Mr. Zimmerman to go free. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case drew the attention of President Barack Obama, who said: &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Sanford, officials said on Friday they were prepared for a possible return of the impassioned demonstrations that arose last year, but expected calm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will not tolerate anyone who uses the verdict as an excuse to violate the law,&quot; Sheriff Donald Eslinger told reporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jury deliberations resume again at 9 a.m. Saturday. </SPAN></P>
