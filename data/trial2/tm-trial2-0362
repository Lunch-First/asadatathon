<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. (AP) - The jury in George Zimmerman's murder trial began a second day of deliberations Saturday morning, weighing whether the neighborhood watch volunteer committed a crime almost a year and a half ago when he fatally shot Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors reconvened in the courtroom at 9 a.m. Saturday. A few smiled as the judge addressed them before they left the courtroom to continue their discussions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About two dozen people gathered outside the courthouse awaiting a verdict, with supporters of the Martin family outnumbering those there for Zimmerman. One man held a sign that read, &quot;We love you George.&quot; A woman lay in the grass in a hoodie, her arms spread, in a re-creation of Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Twitter, Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, shared what she called her favorite Bible verse: &quot;Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday afternoon, as the jury began deliberations, police and civic leaders in this Orlando suburb went on national television to plead for calm in Sanford and across the country if Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, is acquitted. Martin was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no party in this case who wants to see any violence,&quot; Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said. &quot;We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, people protested in Sanford and across the country last year when authorities waited 44 days before arresting Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, is charged with second-degree murder, but the jury also is allowed to consider manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge's decision to allow that consideration was a potentially heavy blow to the defense: It could give jurors who aren't convinced the shooting amounted to murder a way to hold Zimmerman responsible for the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors must show only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman faces a maximum prison sentence of life for second-degree murder and 30 years if convicted of manslaughter, due to extra sentencing guidelines for committing a crime with a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sequestered jury of six women - all but one of them white - must sort through conflicting testimony from police, neighbors, friends and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors deliberated for three and a half hours when they decided to stop Friday evening. About two hours into their discussions, they asked for a list of the evidence. Their identities are being kept anonymous - they are identified only by number - but they revealed information about themselves during jury selection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- B-51 is retired, not married and doesn't have kids. She has worked in real estate and run a call center where she said she had experience resolving conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- B-29 recently moved to central Florida from Chicago. She works as a nurse on an Alzheimer's section of a nursing home. She is married and has several children. A prosecutor described her as &quot;black or Hispanic&quot; during jury selection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- B-76 is a white woman who has lived in central Florida for 18 years. She manages rental properties with her husband of 30 years. She has two adult children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- B-37 is a white woman who volunteers rescuing animals. She is married to an attorney and has two adult children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- E-6 is married and has two children. She has worked in financial services and is active in her church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- E-40 works as a safety officer and recently moved to Seminole County from Iowa.</SPAN></P>
