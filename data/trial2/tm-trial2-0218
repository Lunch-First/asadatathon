<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's business with the criminal court in Florida may be done, but a federal civil rights investigation remains open, and legal experts say he could face a civil suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal investigation into the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is underway, and prosecutors from the Justice Department's civil rights division will review evidence from the FBI and the Florida trial, the Justice Department said Sunday in a written statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in a gated townhouse community in Sanford, Fla., shot and killed Trayvon on Feb. 26, 2012, as Trayvon returned home from buying snacks at a convenience store. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, claimed he shot the unarmed African-American teenager in self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate,&quot; the Justice statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAACP President Ben Jealous said on CNN that the civil rights organization had spoken with Justice Department officials about lodging federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be a federal civil rights phase,&quot; Jealous said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's family could sue Zimmerman in civil court for wrongful death, following the example of the families of O.J. Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. The families sued the football star and won $33.5million after he was acquitted on murder charges. A wrongful death lawsuit seeks money damages rather than punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., issued a statement urging the family to sue Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While I am profoundly disappointed with the ruling in this case, the criminal portion of the process has run its course,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;I encourage Trayvon's parents to pursue vindication of their rights under civil law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barbara Arnwine, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, called the verdict a &quot;tragic miscarriage of justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter how you look at this situation, if it were not for the actions of Mr. Zimmerman, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would still be alive with his family today,&quot; she said in a statement. &quot;Yet there is still the potential for justice to be served through a civil suit brought about by Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's surviving family members, and also through civil rights charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Zimmerman has few assets, a book or movie deal could make him a lucrative target for a wrongful death suit, said Randy Reep, a criminal defense attorney in Jacksonville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from money, the family might sue &quot;if only for a victory in principle,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the acquittal in criminal court, Trayvon's parents could win in civil court, where a lower standard of proof prevails, he said. A jury in civil court need only be convinced that Zimmerman &quot;more likely than not&quot; is responsible for Trayvon's wrongful death, he said. In a criminal court, a jury can acquit if they have &quot;reasonable doubt.&quot; Zimmerman would be immune to such a lawsuit only if he asked for a hearing under Florida's &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; law and a judge found he justifiably used force in self-defense in the face of an &quot;unlawful threat,&quot; Reep said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's lawyer, Mark O'Mara, spoke Saturday night on the possibility of suits against his client.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the civil aspect, if someone believes that it's appropriate to sue George Zimmerman, then we will seek and we will get immunity in a civil hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll see just how many civil lawsuits are spawned from this fiasco.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
