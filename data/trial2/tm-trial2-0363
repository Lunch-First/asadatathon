<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The best I can tell, there's been insufficient evidence for the prosecution to get a conviction on any of the theories, second-degree murder or manslaughter, and there's not enough evidence for the defense to claim self-defense,&quot; said Dwight Aarons, a criminal law professor at the University of Tennessee.<BR>Zimmerman, 29, has been charged with second-degree murder, but the jury will also be allowed to consider manslaughter in the shooting.<BR>The investigation and monthlong trial have been extensively covered by national media, in part because of early claims of racial profiling.<BR>Zimmerman's lawyers have painted 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as a street-smart thug who slammed Zimmerman's head against the pavement, making him fear for his life. The prosecution has cast Martin as a harmless teen who was carrying skittles and iced tea when he was gunned down by an overzealous cop wannabe.<BR>&quot;I think both sides have had a tough time in this case in the sense of proving murder or proving self-defense, because I don't think the full truth has come out,&quot; said Melanie Reid, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Miami and current law professor at Lincoln Memorial University. &quot;We haven't seen the full fight, just little pieces of it. So as much as we'd like to see justice and truth come out at a trial, sometimes that's just not possible.&quot;<BR>Both Zimmerman's and Martin's mothers claimed to hear their sons screaming for help in the background of 911 recordings. Zimmerman did not take the stand, but the defense offered up witnesses who spoke to him after the shooting.<BR>&quot;He's the guy who, one would think, the jury is just strongly desiring to hear from because he's the only one other than the victim who was there,&quot; said Aarons. &quot;They would have a friend come in and say 'He told me this,' but the guy is sitting right across the room. It's a clever way of having his words in the courtroom without having him on the stand.&quot;<BR>Reid and Aarons said the verdict delivered by the panel of six women could go either way, though the judge's decision this week to include the option of a manslaughter charge could make a conviction easier.</SPAN></P>
