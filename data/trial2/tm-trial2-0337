<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. - At 2:30 p.m. Friday, six women rose from their seats in Courtroom 5D here and slipped into a back room where they will decide a case that has transfixed the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key piece of evidence will go to the same back room: the Kel-Tec 9 mm handgun that neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman used to kill teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors will consider charges of second-degree murder, which requires prosecutors to prove Zimmerman had a &quot;depraved mind&quot; and &quot;ill intent,&quot; and the lesser offense of manslaughter. But Judge Debra Nelson blocked a prosecution attempt to add the option of a third-degree murder charge based on the claim that Zimmerman committed child abuse since Martin was a minor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Friday afternoon, the jurors asked the judge for an index of all the evidence, the Associated Press reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their deliberations began not long after Zimmerman's defense attorney told jurors that much still isn't known about what happened on that dark, rainy night in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in a soothing, conversational tone, attorney Mark O'Mara urged jurors not to make assumptions about the defendant accused of killing Martin and not to try to &quot;fill in blanks&quot; or &quot;connect dots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only conclusion jurors could reach about his client after hearing testimony for three weeks, O'Mara said, is &quot;innocence. Pure, unadulterated innocence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes into his closing argument, O'Mara walked over to the defense table, and Zimmerman, dressed in a dark blazer and tie, stood. The defendant held his head high and gazed directly at the jury with a neutral expression on his face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara placed his hand on the shoulder of Zimmerman, a humanizing gesture. O'Mara's demeanor contrasted with the style of assistant state attorney Bernie de la Rionda, who often shouted and spoke in impassioned tones during prosecution closing arguments on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
