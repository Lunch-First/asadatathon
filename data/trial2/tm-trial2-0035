<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RACIAL tensions are at fever pitch in the US with calls for calm after a Hispanic man was found not guilty of murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of a black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbourhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman received a wave of online death threats and authorities in Miami were last night working to stave off riots after a six-member jury -- all women, five of them white -- acquitted Mr Zimmerman, who was charged with murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors found 29-year-old Mr Zimmerman acted in self-defence when he shot Mr Martin, an unarmed, black 17-year-old, on February 26, 2012, as the two fought near Mr Zimmerman's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman showed no emotion when the verdict was read yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While defence attorney Mark O'Mara said his team was ecstatic at the outcome, co-counsel Don West was defiant and angry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I'm glad this jury kept this tragedy from being a travesty,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury had been given the chance to convict Mr Zimmerman of manslaughter but did not do so, despite asking for a clarification of the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict was a heart-breaking outcome for Mr Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, as well as crowds outside the courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About an hour after the verdict was read, attorneys for Mr Martin's family said they -- and the family -- were urging people to remain calm in the wake of the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``For Trayvon to rest in peace, we must all be peaceful,'' attorney Benjamin Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman shot Mr Martin as the two fought on the ground near Mr Zimmerman's Sanford home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments earlier the defendant had called police, describing Mr Martin, a high school junior from Miami Gardens, as acting suspiciously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite three weeks of evidence, attorneys and witnesses were unable to definitively say how the two came face to face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman said he shot the teenager in self-defence, that Mr Martin had punched him in the nose, breaking it, and knocked him to the ground before hammering his head against a footpath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, lead prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda said: ``Am I disappointed? Yes, because I thought he was guilty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His boss, special prosecutor Angela Corey, said her office had not over-reached by charging Mr Zimmerman with second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors faced a huge obstacle: They could not prove who threw the first punch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors were swayed by the evidence of Rachel Jeantel, a 19-year-old Miami woman on the phone with Mr Martin moments before he was shot, who said Mr Martin was worried about a ``creepy-ass cracker'' who was following him.</SPAN></P>
