Protests were growing in the US last night after the acquittal of a Neighbourhood Watch captain who shot dead an unarmed teenager in Florida.
Rallies were called across the country after George Zimmerman, 29, was found not guilty of the seconddegree murder of TrayvonMartin, 17, who was killed in February last year when he was mistaken for a prowler. Civil rights leaders called the verdict a "slap in the face for the American people". 
Trayvon had been walking through a gated community in Sanford, near Orlando, where his father lived. Mr Zimmerman, who was depicted by the prosecution as a "wannabe cop", profiled and pursued the black, hoodie-wearing student. His lawyers said he was a wellmeaning volunteer who fired a gun to save his life after Trayvon rounded on him and beat his head on the ground.
The legal team for Trayvon's family described them as heartbroken. "A black 17-year-old child should be able to walk home from a store and not be shot," said Nataly Jackson, one of the family's lawyers.
A Jury of six women - five white and one Hispanic - took 16 hours to acquit Mr Zimmerman, accepting the defendant's claim that he acted in Justifiable self-defence. The case has polarised opinion in America, inflaming those who perceived Mr Zimmerman's actions as racism and raising questions about civil rights and equal Justice.
Leaders of the civil rights movement will go to Sanford this week to head rallies. "In my view the American legal system has once again failed Justice," the Rev Jesse Jackson said.
Mr Zimmerman may be free but will be "looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life", his brother said. The Justice Department said that he might be prosecuted in a federal court for civil rights violations, but President Obama suggested that was unlikely. "A Jury has spoken," he said, calling for calm.
Police in Sanford at first declined to charge Mr Zimmerman, but were forced to do so after pressure from political, religious and community leaders.
