Sanford (US): A six-woman jury has found a neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering an unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, in a racially charged trial that has transfixed the United States. 
Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing Martin through a gated community in Sanford, Florida, and shooting him during an altercation. Defence lawyers insisted Zimmerman acted in self-defence after Martin (17) wrestled him to the ground and started bashing his head into the pavement.The February 2012 killing ignited widespread controversy after police initially declined to press charges against Zimmerman. Martin had no criminal record and was on a snack run, returning to the house where he was staying as a guest.Zimmerman was arrested only after civil rights leaders championed the case and demonstrators marched to demand action.The case began as a routine homicide but soon evolved into a civil rights cause examining racial profiling and its consequences - an issue barred from the courtroom - and setting off a broad discussion of race relations in America.Even President Obama, after the shooting, had expressed sympathy for the dead teenager's family and urged a thorough investigation. "If I had a son," Obama said, "he'd look like Martin."Outside the courthouse, a hundred protesters who had been gathering through the night, their numbers building as the hours passed, began pumping their fists in the air, waving placards and chanting, "No justice, no peace!"
