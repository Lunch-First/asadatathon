AMERICA is gripped by the George Zimmerman trial. The fate of the Hispanic vigilante who shot and killed unarmed black teen, TrayvonMartin, has become the biggest race sensation since OJ Simpson was acquitted. 
With more twists and turns than an episode of Law & Order, the seemingly open-and-shut case has got the airwaves buzzing.
There was the way a TV network doctored the tape of a 911 call, to make Zimmerman sound racist.
There was the victim's girlfriend who was destroyed by the defence, unable even to read a letter she supposedly wrote.
There was a "knock knock" joke used by Zimmerman's " lawyer as the victim's mother sobbed in open court.
Drugs in Trayvon's system and witnesses who saw the teen on top of Zimmerman - the pendulum has swung back and forwards, making this more like entertainment than a murder trial.
By the time you read this the verdict will probably be out - and guilty or innocent, the debate will rage for days.
It's disturbing to see how political the case has become - with Republicans largely - supporting the defence and outraged Democrats rallying to the prosecution.
The most appalling aspect that has emerged is yet ANOTHER Obama abuse of power - one that would be unthinkable in Britain. It has emerged the Department of Justice PAID for protests over the Trayvon killing - funding activists to march, even - as charges were being considered against Zimmerman.
Imagine Home Secretary Theresa May trying that - a British judge would have dismissed the case in two seconds flat for prejudicing a jury.
One thing is certain - TrayvonMartin was unarmed. And if America had gun control, a fist fight between the two men is the worst thing that would have happened.
Instead, one young man is dead and the other is having his life turned upside down.
But no potential Presidential candidate shows any sign of being willing to slow down - america's own private arms race - and we can bet Trayvon won't be the last.
