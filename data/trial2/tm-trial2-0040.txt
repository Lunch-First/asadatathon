AMERICA was braced for the threat of race riots last night after a neighbourhood watch volunteer was cleared of murdering an unarmed black teenager. 
City leaders and police appealed for calm as George Zimmerman walked free from court following the killing of Trayvon Martin, 17, in February last year.
Zimmerman, 29, who said he acted in self-defence, went into hiding after receiving death threats on Twitter.
There were also reports of sporadic violence at demos across the US.
The trial had divided the nation, with many believing the killing and police handling of the case were racially motivated.
Cops failed to act for weeks until a national outcry led prosecutors to bring charges against Zimmerman.
He shot Martin in a struggle after the youth was seen acting suspiciously in a gated complex patrolled by Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida.
Martin's parents Tracy and Sybrina were not in court.
Dad Tracy said: "Even in his death I know my baby is proud of the fight we, along with all of you, put up for him."
Police said authorities in Sanford and other parts of the US were preparing for the prospect of mass protests or civil unrest.
