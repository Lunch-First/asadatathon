<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undeniable truth of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case is that, based on fevered assumptions about a 17-year-old black teenager, George Zimmerman provoked a confrontation in which he ended up shooting a young man to death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Zimmerman's trial closed Friday, his defense lawyer declared in summation that the unarmed Martin was to blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know he had the opportunity to go home, and he didn't do that,&quot; Mark O'Mara said, brazenly turning the world on its head. &quot;The person who decided to make the night violent was the guy who didn't go home when he had the chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-member jury will decide whether prosecutors met the burden of proving that Zimmerman's actions fit the definitions of either second-degree murder or manslaughter. Those judgments will entail wrestling with whether, in the end, Zimmerman can be credited with shooting Martin in self-defense, however culpable Zimmerman's own conduct was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That he bears damnable responsibility, as distinct from legal guilt, for Martin's death is clear. Zimmerman alone instigated what happened in Sanford, Fla., on the night of Feb. 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was scouting for burglars on neighborhood watch and, of critical importance, he carried a gun. Spotting Martin, he profiled a black teenager in a hoodie as a likely criminal. In fact, Martin was merely returning home from the store with a soda and a package of Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman shadowed Martin and continued to do so after being instructed to stop by a police dispatcher. At one point, Martin told his girlfriend by cellphone that a &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot; was following him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened next may never be known and is at the heart of the jury's deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman claimed in pre-trial statements that Trayvon suddenly punched him, pinned him to the ground, knocked his head against the sidewalk and grabbed for Zimmerman's gun. It was then, Zimmerman said, that he shot Trayvon out of fear for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors poked holes in this story - noting, for example, that Zimmerman's modest head wounds were hardly consistent with the violent struggle he described. But, since no one else alive witnessed the fight, the only word anyone has is the killer's. Plus his lawyer's blame-the-victim contention that everything went wrong because Martin didn't just walk home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Zimmerman groundlessly presumed the worst about a teenager who was doing nothing wrong. After Zimmerman took it upon himself to play cop after the real cops had told him to stand down. After Zimmerman brought a gun to a confrontation that could easily escalate into a fatality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the jury's verdict, Zimmerman started it that night - and finished it with a bullet.</SPAN></P>
