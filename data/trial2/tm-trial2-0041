<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMERICAN cities are braced for race riots following the acquittal of a vigilante who killed an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, who shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as the 17-year-old was returning from a trip to the shops, was cleared of murder and manslaughter charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors said Zimmerman was a wannabe cop' who identified his victim as a potential troublemaker simply by racial profiling'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But jurors accepted the 29-year-old's claim that he had acted in self-defence after the teenager attacked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-strong jury included five white women and another woman of undisclosed ethnicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protest marches were held within hours of Saturday night's verdict and violence was reported as far away as Oakland in California. Gangs of youths attacked police and attempted to set cars on fire while others smashed windows in a downtown area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police swamped the town of Sanford, Florida, where the trial took place and the gated estate where Trayvon was killed was barricaded off to stop any demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers have put in place plans to stop youths from forming flash mobs' having learned from the London riots where gangs used social media to organise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman went into hiding immediately after the verdict. He was described as a dead man walking', having received numerous death threats. The neighbourhood watch volunteer killed Trayvon in February last year after he spotted the hooded Miami teenager who was visiting a family friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman called police to report an intruder and followed Trayvon in his car. At some point the pair got into a fight and Trayvon was shot once in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Sanford, which is about 30 miles from Orlando, initially failed to arrest Zimmerman. The killing was ruled justified under Florida's controversial stand your ground' law which allows the use of deadly force if a person is in fear of their life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after protests across the US, Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a three-week trial the case was widely seen to have fallen apart after defence witnesses backed up Zimmerman's story that he was attacked by Trayvon, who apparently told him he was going to die tonight'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A crucial part of the evidence rested on who was heard on an emergency call screaming for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents said it was their son, while Zimmerman's family and friends insisted it was him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A forensic expert said the gunshot wound showed Trayvon was on top of Zimmerman when the fatal shot was fired. Legal experts said the prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Zimmerman had deliberately killed the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They acknowledged this by asking the judge at the 11th hour to let the jury consider a lesser charge of manslaughter. The jury took 16 hours to find Zimmerman not guilty of all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's defence team said the case would never have gone to trial had he been black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyer Michael O'Mara said the case was taken up by civil rights leaders and Zimmerman was charged for political reasons to create a civil rights event'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many celebrities took to Twitter to express outrage at the verdict, while the singer Beyonce held a minute's silence at her concert in Tennessee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protest: Supporters demonstrate outside the court Cleared: George Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
