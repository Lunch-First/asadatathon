WASHINGTON (AP) President Barack Obama says the death of Trayvon Martin was a tragedy for America.
Obama says he knows the not-guilty verdict reached late Saturday has elicited strong passions around the U.S. In a statement released Sunday, Obama is asking that all Americans respect the call for calm reflection. There have been a number of rallies and protests, most of which have been peaceful. 
Obama says Americans should ask themselves if they"re doing all they can to stem gun violence, and what can be done to prevent future tragedies like the Florida shooting.
Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of Martin, an unarmed teen. Martin"s killing in February 2012 unleashed debate across the U.S. over racial profiling, self-defense and equal justice.
