George Zimmerman was acquitted of murder in the death of TrayvonMartin. Civil rights groups are pushing for new charges to be filed against Zimmerman.
At what point do we stop playing the race card every time a black person does not get what the NAACP feels is the right decision?  Does the NAACP realize that constantly bringing it up simply promotes further racism? 
This is our legal system. This is what we have to work with. Six jurors  analyzed the evidence. Who are we to second-guess what was presented in court? Who are we to say justice was or was not served? Did you sit on the jury? Were you sitting in the courtroom? No.

I don't call it playing the race card.  This trial is about race in the way the justice system handled the situation. We have a country based on being judged by peers. For the jury to be realistically made up of peers,  there should have been a black mother on it, at least one.
Adding to the outrage is that this happens daily. Blacks are convicted in similar scenarios: A black guy hits another black guy; they fight, and one feels threatened and shoots. The shooter gets convicted, but not in this case; that's the issue.

Verdicts aren't meant to placate. We must accept that this jury reached its decision because jurors believed Zimmerman was in fear of his own life when he shot Trayvon.

Zimmerman should have been held accountable in some manner for his actions. Had the prosecution pursued manslaughter charges at the beginning, instead of second-degree murder, perhaps a different verdict would have been reached. The prosecution botched this case.

A black kid might ask himself, "Do I have the right to walk the street directly to my home from a convenience store?" The Florida jury answered all black children loud and clear: "Not in America."
The expression on George Zimmerman's lawyers' faces was unmistakably articulate: pure joy. Not even O.J. Simpson's lawyers were so jubilant. Read the lawyers' faces. They were happier than Zimmerman, who knew the truth.

The not guilty verdict proves that  Florida police were correct in not charging George Zimmerman with murder. The police chief who stepped down should sue the state. This was nothing more than a racially, politically charged case of local citizens being hijacked of their tax monies, backed by the NAACP and most cable TV news stations.
