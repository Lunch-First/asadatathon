NEW YORK (AP) -- Demonstrators from across the country are protesting a jury's decision to clear George Zimmerman in the 2012 shooting death of an unarmed black teenager while the Justice Department considers whether to file criminal civil rights charges. 
Rallies on Sunday attracted anywhere from a few dozen people to more than a thousand as demonstrators voiced their support for 17-year-old Trayvon Martin's family -- and decried Zimmerman's not guilty verdict as a miscarriage of justice.
The NAACP and protesters are calling for federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who was acquitted Saturday in Martin's death.
The Justice Department says it is looking into the case to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman has been acquitted in the state case.
