<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. (AP) - George Zimmerman's defense attorney began his final arguments Friday, trying to convince six jurors that the neighborhood watch volunteer acted in self-defense when he fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Mark O'Mara told jurors the burden was on prosecutors, and they hadn't proven Zimmerman's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. He said prosecutors built a case on a series hypothetical &quot;could've beens&quot; and &quot;maybes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it hasn't been proven, it's not just there,&quot; O'Mara said. &quot;You can't fill in the gaps. You can't connect the dots. You're not allowed to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six jurors could begin deliberating later Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day earlier, prosecutors made said Zimmerman assumed Martin was a criminal who was up to no good when he confronted him in his neighborhood. A scuffle followed, and Zimmerman fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A teenager is dead. He is dead through no fault of his own,&quot; prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told the jurors during closing arguments. &quot;He is dead because a man made assumptions. ... Unfortunately because his assumptions were wrong, Trayvon Benjamin Martin no longer walks this Earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder, but the jury will also be allowed to consider manslaughter. Because of the way Florida law imposes sentences for crimes committed with a gun, the lesser charge could also carry a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Debra Nelson's ruling to allow consideration of the manslaughter charge came despite the objections of Zimmerman's lawyers. The jurors will have three options for their verdict: guilty of second-degree murder, guilty of manslaughter and not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman attorney Don West had argued an all-or-nothing strategy, saying the only charge that should be put before the jury is second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
