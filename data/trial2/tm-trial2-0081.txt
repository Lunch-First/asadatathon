It is a matter of grave concern that Florida's EUR~Stand your ground' law seems to apply to some people, but not to others. A jury yesterday dismissed all charges against George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer, who fatally shot the unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.
In the same week, Marissa Alexander, who had fired warning shots at her abusive husband, was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Both defendants used the same defence, the Florida EUR~Stand your Ground' law, which is based on the principle that a person may justifiably use force in self-defence when there is reasonable belief of an unlawful threat.
The real danger in the two cases is that they will ignite a furious racial debate across the whole of America since Zimmerman's successful defence may be overshadowed by his white colour and the losing defence of Alexander by her black colour.
The implication of the two cases is that the law works for some (white security guards), but not for others (black abused women), and this is deeply dangerous.
