<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 2012, neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. That is not in dispute. The question is whether it was second-degree murder or manslaughter, or if he acted in self-defense. After the killing, people angry with the shooting took to the streets to protest the lack of an arrest. After Zimmerman was arrested, throngs of both his supporters and opponents have been riveted by the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the jury is in its second day of deliberating the fate of George Zimmerman. As we wait for a verdict, here&quot;s a chronological gallery of photos looking back at the case, from gunshot to jury.</SPAN></P>
