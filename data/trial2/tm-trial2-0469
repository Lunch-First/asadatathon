<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State prosecutors are asking the judge in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin murder case to instruct the jury to consider lesser charges -- manslaughter and aggravated assault -- when they begin deliberations Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's attorneys have objected, and Judge Debra Nelson will hold a hearing this morning to decide whether jurors should consider the new charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury would still have the option of convicting Zimmerman, 29, of the second-degree murder charge that prosecutors sought when the trial began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last-minute maneuvering has been seen by some legal experts as an indication that prosecutors are not as confident about their chances for a second-degree murder conviction. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, has been portrayed by prosecutors as a wanna-be cop who shot Trayvon, who is black, after a confrontation in a gated residential community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They aren't going to go all or nothing,&quot; Jose Baez, a Florida criminal defense attorney, said of state prosecutors. &quot;They aren't blind to the fact that they haven't proven second-degree murder.&quot; Baez successfully defended Casey Anthony, a Florida mother accused of killing her daughter in a capital murder case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman says he acted in self-defense after Trayvon jumped him and began beating him. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, says that race did not factor into his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second-degree murder in Florida carries a possible life sentence. If convicted of manslaughter, Zimmerman could get up to 30 years. Aggravated assault would carry no more than a five-year prison term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors have maintained that Zimmerman profiled Trayvon and assumed an unarmed teen was a threat to his community. They called 38 witnesses, including some who said Zimmerman was the aggressor and continuously played up that Zimmerman followed Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, said he will argue against the lesser charges being considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Self-defense is self-defense,&quot; O'Mara said. &quot;What happened out there was not a crime, so in that context, there shouldn't have been&quot; any charges. <BR></SPAN></P>
