FEARS were growing today that racially charged protests are set to boil over in cities across America after the acquittal of George Zimmerman for shooting dead unarmed black teenager TrayvonMartin.
So far angry demonstrations against the verdict have remained largely peaceful. But police fired rubber bullets in Los Angeles last night after protesters started throwing rocks.
A major motorway in the city was also blocked by a rally. Some protesters climbed on the tops of slowly moving cars carrying them down city streets.
As the night wore on, the protests took a more sinister edge without erupting out of control.
In Oakland protesters burned American flags. There were a number of arrests after thousands of marchers flooded Times Square in New York and then headed towards Harlem.
As dusk fell a modest rally that had begun hours earlier in Union Square grew to a crowd of thousands that snaked through Midtown Manhattan toward Times Square. Demonstrators leaped in front of traffic and chanted "No justice, no peace". In Chicago, hundreds took to the streets.
The protest grew as demonstrators denounced the acquittal of Zimmerman, the 29-year-old neighbourhoodwatch volunteer who shot dead Trayvon, 17, in February last year.
Zimmerman claimed Trayvon had attacked him. A six-member all-women jury in Sanford, Florida, found Zimmerman not guilty on counts of second-degree murder and lesser charges.
The jurors decided that Zimmerman was acting in self defence when he shot the teenager as he walked though the gated apartment complex in Sandford where he was staying temporarily. Allegations of a racist motivation for both the shooting and police failure to initially charge Zimmerman has prompted intense media reporting.
President Obama said: "We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection for two parents who lost their young son."
