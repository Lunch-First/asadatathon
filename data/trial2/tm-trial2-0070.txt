FLORIDA: A six-woman jury has found neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, in a racially charged trial that transfixed the US. 
Zimmerman smiled briefly as the verdict was read. The family of Trayvon Martin was not present.
The jury had deliberated for more than 16 hours since Friday.
Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing Martin through a gated community in Sanford, Florida and shooting him during an altercation.
Defence lawyers insisted Zimmerman acted in self-defence after Martin, 17, wrestled him to the ground and started bashing his head into the pavement.
The February 2012 killing ignited widespread controversy after police initially declined to press charges against Zimmerman.
