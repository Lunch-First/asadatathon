<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We asked our followers on Twitter if they were on the Zimmerman jury, what their verdict would be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's story is unlikely. He wrongfully killed Martin. But defense is creating reasonable doubt. Without lesser charge, we're left with not guilty. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was told to stand down when he made the 911 call. He didn't. He's guilty! End of story.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe it was classic self-defense, and I think the facts are proving it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no evidence to show he did anything wrong. Case dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was on citizen's watch years ago, and we were told under no circumstances should we get out of our car. Our job was only to observe and report. If George Zimmerman had not gotten out of his car to follow Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, none of this would have happened. A 17-year-old was walking home, minding his own business and talking on his cellphone. Then, an armed Zimmerman decided to follow Trayvon. Is this standing one's ground and asserting self-defense? I think not. Had Zimmerman stayed in his car, none of this would have happened. Zimmerman must be held responsible.</SPAN></P>
