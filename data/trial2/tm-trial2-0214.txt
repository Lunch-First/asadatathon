Washington: A Florida jury on Saturday acquitted George Zimmerman,a white neighborhood volunteer watchman,in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager TrayvonMartin,bringing to a close another epic courtroom saga that illustrated America's ceaseless struggle with racial issues.The panel of six women deliberated more than 16 hours over two days till late Saturday night before delivering the not guilty verdict,which drew immediate condemnation from some civil rights groups."Today,justice failed TrayvonMartin and his family," Roslyn Brock,chairperson of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),said in a statement."We call immediately for the justice department to conduct an investigation into the civil rights violations committed against TrayvonMartin." This case has re-energized the movement to end racial profiling in the United States.Amid fears of violence from the outraged black community in some cities,civil rights activist Jesse Jackson tweeted within minutes of the acquittal: "Avoid violence,it will lead to more tragedies.Find a way for self construction not deconstruction in this time of despair." The familiar story began on the night of February 26 last year when George Zimmerman,28,who is actually a multi-racial Hispanic-American,and was the neighborhood watch coordinator for a gated community in Sanford,Florida,shot dead TrayvonMartin,who was staying there temporarily,saying Martin had attacked him and he acted in self-defence.Prosecutors contended that Zimmerman was a "wannabe cop" who tracked down the teenager and shot him without justification.Zimmerman claimed that he was on a personal errand in his vehicle on the rainswept night when he noticed Martin inside the gated compound walking around "suspiciously" looking at all the houses.He called the Sanford police department to report the activity and then exited his vehicle,whereupon he said he had a violent encounter with Martin,subsequently fatally shooting him once in the heart at close range.Police arrived on the scene soon after and took Zimmerman into custody but released him without charges after five hours of questioning him.But the circumstances of Martin's death,including the fact that he was unarmed and police could not establish that he was involved in any criminal activity at the time of the encounter,pitched the story to the front pages of US media.Soon the case electrified America,mostly along racial lines,evoking previous such episodes,most famously the killing of 14-year old Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955 because he flirted with a white woman.Even President Obama,father of two daughters,stepped into the minefield,cautiously saying,"If I had a son,he'd look like Trayvon." That brief,generic interjection did not bring justice the African-American community looked forward to.Anger swept through black neighborhoods at the perceived miscarriage of justice."This is a heartbreaking moment.This will confirm for many that the only problem with the New South is it occupies the same time and space as the old South," another NAACP spokesperson lamented.Jackson called it "Old South Justice" - a reference to white atrocities on black people in Southern United States in the pre-civil rights era.The last has not been heard of the case.Martin's family is expected to pursue a civil lawsuit.CASE DIARY On 26 February 2012,George Zimmerman,28,was patrolling a gated neighbourhood in the city of Sanford,Florida He had organized the neighbourhood watch after a rash of burglaries He spotted 17-year-old TrayvonMartin,wearing a hooded sweatshirt,walking back from a store to his father's fiancee's house He called 911 to report 'a real suspicious guy',a 'black male' walking around Zimmerman followed Martin,and the two engaged in altercation.One of them cried for help before Zimmerman fired one shot into Martin's chest Zimmerman pleaded self-defence when he was taken to police station Zimmerman's lawyers said Martin punched their client,slammed his head into the pavement and reached for his gun The case sparked a debate about racial profiling in the US
