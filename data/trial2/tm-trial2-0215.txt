A SIX-woman jury has found neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering unarmed black teenager TrayvonMartin, in a racially charged trial that transfixed the US. 
``Mr Zimmerman, I have signed the judgment that confirms the jury's verdict,'' Judge Deborah Nelson said soon after the decision was read yesterday.
``Your bond will be released. Your GPS monitor will be cut off when you exit the courtroom over here. And you have no further business with the court.'' Zimmerman smiled briefly but did not appear emotional as the verdict was read. His family, sitting behind him in the courtroom, smiled broadly. The family of TrayvonMartin was not present. Scores of journalists and crowds of demonstrators had gathered outside the courthouse in the dark, awaiting the verdict.
Many of the demonstrators were chanting, ``no justice, no peace''.
The jury had deliberated for more than 16 hours since Friday.
Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing Martin through a gated community in Sanford, Florida, and shooting him during an altercation.
Defence lawyers insisted Zimmerman acted in self-defence after Martin, 17, wrestled him to the ground and started bashing his head into the pavement.
Zimmerman faced possible life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder. The killing in February last year ignited widespread controversy after police initially declined to press charges against Zimmerman.
Community leaders had called for calm on Friday.
``If Zimmerman is convicted, there should not be inappropriate celebrations, because a young man lost his life,'' veteran civil rights activist Rev Jesse Jackson a said.
``If he is not convicted, we should avoid violence because it will only lead to more tragedies.''
