<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Regret is a very strong word . . . Regret implies that your actions - you have culpability in what you did for what happened. ' - Robert Zimmerman Jr. (left), on whether his acquitted brother, George (right), felt  any regret over the killing last year of unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin (center) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  George Zimmerman plans to start packing heat again - the same gun he used to kill Trayvon&nbsp;Martin - and he's going to need it, his lawyer said yesterday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defense lawyer Mark O'Mara said Zimmerman's acquittal by a Florida jury means he's entitled to get back the Kel Tec-9 pistol he used to fatally shoot Martin last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked whether Zimmerman, 29, intends to carry the weapon, O'Mara replied &quot;yes.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;[There's] even more reason now, isn't there?&quot; O'Mara told ABC News. &quot;There are a lot of people out there who actually hate him, though they shouldn't.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The lawyer's comments came as Zimmerman's brother, Robert Jr., said George has no regrets over the deadly confrontation - and nothing to apologize for. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Regret is a very strong word,'' Robert Zimmerman told CNN.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Regret implies that your actions - you have culpability in what you did for what happened. And I think that's what you're asking is, 'Does he share or accept the blame?' I think that George, outside of the word 'blame,' feels and has felt - and I've expressed this before - very bad.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Robert - who has been acting as a spokesman for his embattled family - added that his brother should not apologize for anything. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I don't think that people who are forthcoming and forthright in what they do and believe they're doing the right thing should then go back,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Robert also said George &quot;does have emotion about the fact that he had to take a life in self-defense,&quot; before adding, &quot;But that is incompatible with finding culpability in what he did.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On NPR, Robert Zimmerman said he took &quot;exception&quot; to the notion that Martin was &quot;unarmed&quot; during his struggle with George on Feb. 26, 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He used the sidewalk against my brother's head,&quot; Robert said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Robert told CNN that his brother - who has gotten death threats - &quot;is going to be looking around his shoulder for the rest of his life.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman - who has been in hiding for months and wears a bulletproof vest and a disguise whenever he ventures out - remained in seclusion yesterday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His not-guilty verdict spurred protests across the nation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Civil-rights leaders urged the feds to bring charges against Zimmerman for shooting Martin, 17, while on a volunteer neighborhood-watch patrol of his gated community in Sanford, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement, President Obama called Martin's death a &quot;tragedy&quot; for the entire country that &quot;has elicited strong passions.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,&quot; Obama said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama also said that &quot;the way to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot; is to &quot;ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  O'Mara all but dared Martin's family to file a widely anticipated civil suit against Zimmerman, adding that Zimmerman might be filing lawsuits of his own. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;There are a number of events that happened during this case and the way certain people handled it that we may need to hold responsible. We'll see,&quot; O'Mara said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Close friends of Zimmerman told Reuters that he was deeply hurt by the way prosecutors portrayed him as a racist vigilante who targeted Martin simply because he was black. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  John Donnelly, who testified for the defense, said Zimmerman told him: &quot;Sometimes, I have to go look at a mirror. They are talking about a totally different human being. They are talking about a racist. I'm not a racist.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over dinner recently with Donnelly and his wife, Leanne Benjamin, the one-time cop wannabe said he now hopes to become a lawyer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I'd like to help other people like me,&quot; Benjamin quoted him saying. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said he had already contacted the Justice Department and pledged that &quot;there will be a federal civil-rights phase&quot; against Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;How is it that young Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could be killed by George Zimmerman and George Zimmerman gets no time, when Michael Vick got 2&sup1;/  years for killing dogs?&quot; Jealous fumed on CNN's &quot;State of the Union,&quot; referring to the African-American NFL star who went to jail for running dog fights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;There is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young Trayvon,&quot; Jealous said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) vowed that the case wasn't over yet.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think the Justice Department is going to take a look at this. This isn't over with, and I think that's good,&quot; Reid said on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Reid added: &quot;I support the system. I'll accept the verdict.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Rev. Al Sharpton said federal charges were the next available route in the Martin family's quest for justice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Clearly, there are grounds for civil-rights charges,&quot; Sharpton said on &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The trial happened. The verdict came in. It does not exhaust the legal options of this family and the bigger community issues of civil rights.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a prepared statement, the Justice Department said it was evaluating &quot;the evidence generated during the federal investigation, as well as the evidence and testimony from the state trial.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil-rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate ,&quot; the statement added. </SPAN></P>
