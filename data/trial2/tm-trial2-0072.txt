Trayvon Martin nearly went to his grave unnoticed, his death barely recorded among the grim statistics of gun violence involving African American youths. 
But the determination of his parents combined with the amplifying echo-chamber of social media, turned the death into a cause celebre - and a litmus test of justice in America. It put the country's proliferating "stand your ground" gun laws, racial profiling and police incompetence in the dock.
On 8 March, Martin's parents launched a petition on change.org, complaining that George Zimmerman had been released without charge and calling on the local district attorney to investigate. The petition went viral, attracting more than 2m signatures within days, a record for the campaigns website. Protests were staged around America, the crowds sporting hoodies and eating Skittles sweets, as Martin had the evening he died.
However, Zimmerman's trial was largely stripped of many of these elements. Lawyers appeared to tread carefully around the issues of race, the social backgrounds of the protagonists, and Florida gun laws.
That Zimmerman suspected Martin of being a criminal because he was black was never suggested in three weeks of testimony; Martin's size, weight, demeanour and hooded top were. Observers of the trial would have been largely oblivious to the wider civil rights and social controversies surrounding it.
