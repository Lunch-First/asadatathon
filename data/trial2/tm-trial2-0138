<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Giants star Victor Cruz yesterday admitted he dropped the ball by predicting George Zimmerman would be dead within a year from vigilante justice.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The popular, squeaky-clean wide receiver apologized for the ominous tweet, posted moments after Florida jurors acquitted the neighborhood-watch volunteer in the killing of Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;My tweet last night was my initial interpretation of the reaction I was reading on Twitter,&quot; Cruz wrote yesterday. &quot;I immediately realized my tweet was a mistake, and I apologize. That's why I deleted it.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The day before, Cruz had tweeted: &quot;Thoroughly confused. Zimmerman doesn't last a year before the hood catches up to him.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his much more conciliatory later tweet, Cruz said the tragedy of Martin's death should spark more dialogue and less violence.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;I believe conversation not confrontation leads to change and progress,&quot; Cruz wrote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I never have and never advocate violence under any circumstances and I pray that we all encourage and educate each other.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz added that he has only kind thoughts for the victim's loved ones, saying, &quot;My prayers continue to go out to Trayvon Martin's family.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Giants spokesman said the team had no role in Cruz's decision to remove the offending tweet or his apology.  </SPAN></P>
