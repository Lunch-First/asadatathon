India, July 15 -- Beyonce called for a moment of silence for Trayvon Martin during a concert just hours after George Zimmerman was found not guilty by a Florida jury. 
The pop star took a moment to honour the teen during her concert on Saturday night at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tenn.
After asking the crowd to be silent for a moment, she sang the chorus of I Will Always Love You, a song written by country music star Dolly Parton and brought to a global audience by the late Whitney Houston, before transitioning into her hit Halo.
It was just one of several reactions from celebrities and artists following Zimmer-man's acquittal earlier Satu-rday evening. Zimme-rman had been charged with second-degree murder after shooting and killing the unarmed 17-year-old in February 2012.
