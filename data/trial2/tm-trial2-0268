<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A FLORIDA JURY found George Zimmerman not guilty Saturday night in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin - triggering a storm of outrage among civil rights activists.The 29-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer barely reacted after the verdict was read at 9:59 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His face nearly blank, Zimmerman merely shook the hands of one of his lawyers. It wasn't until three minutes later that he cracked a smile. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the Seminole County Courthouse, supporters of Martin's family cried out, &quot;No! No!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton blasted the verdict, calling it a &quot;slap in the face to those who believe in justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that this is an atrocity,&quot; he added. &quot;It is probably one of the worst situations that I have seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are outraged and heartbroken over today's verdict,&quot; said NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous, vowing to pursue civil rights charges with the Department of Justice.The verdict means Zimmerman escapes a lengthy prison sentence but still faces a likely civil suit for gunning down the unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It brings a stunning end to a more than year-long drama that began on a rainy night when Zimmerman encountered young Trayvon walking through the teen's townhouse complex in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, dressed in a hooded sweatshirt, was returning from a 7-Eleven where he purchased a package of Skittles and an Arizona fruit drink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman could have been convicted of second-degree murder or manslaughter.The verdict was handed down by a panel of six women that included just one minority member - but also five mothers. The jurors deliberated for more than 16 hours over two days, rendering a verdict that brought the Zimmerman family to tears. Several family members were still hugging each other as the ashen-faced prosecutors stormed out of the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents were not present for the verdict. But they bared their heartbreak in messages posted on Twitter.&quot;Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you,&quot; wrote Sybrina Fulton. &quot;You are all that I have. At the end of the day, GOD is still in control. Thank you all for your prayers and support. I will love you forever Trayvon!!!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though I am broken hearted my faith is unshattered I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MY BABY TRAY,&quot; Martin's father, Tracy, tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors were restrained in their reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm disappointed,&quot; prosecutor Bernie De La Rondia said, &quot;but we accept the jury's verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's defense team expressed muted joy at a post-verdict news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am gratified by the jury's verdict,&quot; said lawyer Don West. &quot;As happy as I am for George Zimmerman, I'm thrilled that the jury kept this tragedy from becoming a travesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., told CNN host Piers Morgan: &quot;I don't think this is a time for high-fiving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that his brother will never truly be a free man. &quot;He's going to be looking around his shoulder for the rest of his life,&quot; he said.The polarizing case riveted the nation and cast a spotlight on Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys said the case was classic self-defense, claiming Martin tackled Zimmerman to the ground and was bashing his head against the concrete sidewalk when Zimmerman opened fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors portrayed Zimmerman as a &quot;wanna-be cop&quot; vigilante who profiled Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They argued that Zimmerman, frustrated by a spate of break-ins in his neighborhood, instigated the confrontation.The jurors began their second day of deliberations about 9 a.m. on Saturday, took breaks for lunch and dinner, and continued deliberating into the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four hours before the verdict was announced, the jury - in a move that left defense lawyers unhappy and observers expecting a compromise verdict - asked for a clarification on the manslaughter charge against their client. That note came out of the jury room about 6 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel's request raised speculation that jurors could opt for the lesser charge against Zimmerman..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse earlier in the day, about 100 people gathered for word of a verdict in the racially charged case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We love you, George!&quot; shouted those on the murder defendant's side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice for Trayvon!&quot; responded those seeking a Zimmerman conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some supporters of the Martin family wore hoodies in the blistering Florida sun in solidarity with the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheriff's deputies intervened to keep the two sides apart after one particularly heated exchange. The deputies stepped in before any punches were thrown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Saturday, the demonstrations remained peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, a Martin family lawyer, said the teen will go down in history alongside other civil rights heroes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin will forever remain in the annals of history next to Medgar Evers and Emmett Till as a symbol for the fight for equal justice for all,&quot; Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For Trayvon to rest in peace, we must all be peaceful.&quot;The jury spent 3 1/2 hours deliberating on Friday after hearing summations in the three-week trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton, speaking earlier Saturday in Harlem, said the verdict would not signal the end of the legal fight - whether Zimmerman was guilty or innocent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain in his gated Florida community, was arrested 44 days after the shooting following coast-to-coast outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even President Obama weighed in, saying, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But anger and disbelief over the long-delayed arrest went beyond the African-American community, as people throughout the nation saw it as a glaring example of unequal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Sanford was besieged by angry demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barraged with criticism, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, appointed State Attorney Angela Corey to revisit the case, and she decided there was evidence to charge Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the case came to be seen through a prism of black and white, it wasn't that simple. Zimmerman is part Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case also exposed the nation's ugly racist underbelly, with Zimmerman supporters flooding the Internet with photos of a thuggish-looking Trayvon that were actually the rapper Game and insisting - based on no evidence - that the high school junior from Miami Gardens was a budding gangster with a criminal record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from Zimmerman, there were no witnesses to the struggle that ended with Trayvon dead with a bullet in his chest.</SPAN></P>
