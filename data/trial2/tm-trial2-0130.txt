BEYONCE TRIBUTE
BEYONCE honoured Trayvon Martin, the black teenager shot in 2012, at her Nashville concert on Saturday. Her show started about 30 minutes after the not guilty verdict for George Zimmerman began to circulate. ``I'd like to have a moment of silence for Trayvon,'' the pop star said. After the silent tribute, she sang the chorus of I Will Always Love You .
