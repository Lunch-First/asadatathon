<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;After a 5-week trial, 50 witnesses and 16 hours of deliberation, 6 jurors decide:<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury of six women late Saturday found that George Zimmerman shot to death 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin to save his own life on a rainy night in February 2012 when the two met in a gated suburban neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After deliberating more than 15 hours, jurors found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder or manslaughter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman showed little emotion as the verdict was read about 10 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the evening, jurors sent a note to the judge asking for clarification about the charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;May we please have clarification on the instructions regarding manslaughter,&quot; Judge Debra Nelson read from the jurors' note Saturday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for the state and Zimmerman's defense decided to respond by asking the jury to be more specific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court cannot engage in general discussions but may be able to address a specific question regarding clarification of the instructions regarding manslaughter,&quot; they wrote back to the jury. &quot;If you have a specific question, please submit it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors, who have been sequestered during the trial, did not immediately respond but continued deliberating as the sun fell and night descended on protesters gathered in front of the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center. The group was the largest and most vocal since the trial started three weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second-degree murder, but prosecutors also persuaded the judge to allow them to offer the jury a lesser charge of manslaughter, punishable by up to 30 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors had to show only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win a second-degree murder conviction, prosecutors would had to have convinced jurors that Zimmerman acted with ill will, hatred or spite toward Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second-degree murder is punishable by life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse, the two groups of protesters were peaceful for most of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man against violence in the media played a banjo. Two women walked on stilts and started a chorus of Lean on Me.One woman pretended to be dead in the grass, near a bag of Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearby, a smaller group of Zimmerman supporters held signs that said, &quot;We love you George'' and &quot;George got hit you must acquit.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One woman wore a T-shirt that said &quot;I believe you Zimmerman'' and held a sign that said &quot;It doesn't matter what this sign says you'll call it racism anyway.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He deserves some respect and appreciation,&quot; Casey David Kole Sr., 66, shouted about the former neighborhood watch leader. &quot;It's a tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patricia Dalton, 60, yelled back: &quot;It's a tragedy that could have been avoided!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dalton, like most of the 100 or so people at the suburban Orlando courthouse, said she came to support the family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some had come just to watch, standing in the shade outside the protest area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late in the afternoon, a man began shouting about welfare checks and crack cocaine and got into a heated exchange with a Martin supporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police separated the two, but no arrests were made. Later, after dark, two men were ejected from the protest zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family say Zimmerman profiled Martin because of the teen's race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those allegations, and a 44-day delay before police arrested Zimmerman, sparked nationwide protests involving leading national civil rights leaders and spurred emotional debates about gun control, self-defense laws, race, and equal justice under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police and civic leaders have pleaded for calm in Sanford and across the country after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no party in this case who wants to see any violence,&quot; Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said. &quot;We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York on Saturday, the Rev. Al Sharpton said that no matter the verdict, any demonstrations that follow it must be peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Jesse Jackson had a similar message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tweeted that people should &quot;avoid violence because it only leads to more tragedies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday morning, Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, shared on Twitter what she called her favorite Bible verse:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
