<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI (AP) - Police and city leaders in Florida say they have taken precautionary steps for the possibility of mass protests or even civil unrest if George Zimmerman is acquitted in the killing of unarmed teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, particularly in African-American neighborhoods where passions run strongest over the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, officials in Sanford and South Florida have been working with pastors, youth coaches, community activists and summer camp counselors to stress a non-violent approach if Zimmerman walks free. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, police say they have quietly been making plans for dealing with any potential emotional flare-ups that could quickly turn into storefront-smashing, car-burning riots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's all right to be vocal, but we don't want to be violent,&quot; said the Rev. Walter T. Richardson, a longtime pastor and chairman of Miami-Dade County's Community Relations Board, which has been holding town hall-style meetings about the case. &quot;We've already lost one soul and we don't want to lose any more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, from the suburb of Miami Gardens, was 17 when he died. He was in Sanford visiting his father and father's fiancee when Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, fatally shot him during a physical confrontation in a gated community in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's supporters portrayed the shooting as racially motivated, while Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, claimed self-defense. Charged with second-degree murder, Zimmerman is pleading not guilty at the trial unfolding in a Sanford courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After police initially refused to arrest Zimmerman, there were many large but peaceful protests in both Sanford and the Miami area - as well as in New York and other cities. Those demonstrations included a mass walkout at nearly three dozen South Florida high schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in Sanford say they doubt the trial's outcome would spark local residents to take to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main focus was to get Zimmerman arrested and have him tried before a jury of his peers in a court of law,&quot; said Clayton Turner Jr., president of the Seminole County branch of the NAACP. &quot;That was the main issue, not how we felt about whether he's innocent or guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone is so certain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shantree Hall, 37, a lifelong Sanford resident who is black, said a Zimmerman acquittal might anger many in the African-American community who already feel they are less likely to obtain justice. The protests that led to Zimmerman's arrest taught many people that was the only way to get things done, she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With Trayvon, the noise was too loud for them. That's why they couldn't sweep it under the rug,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent Miami-area high school graduate Jude Bruno, 18, said he doesn't sense from friends and peers that there is a powder keg in South Florida waiting to explode should Zimmerman be found innocent. Bruno is chairman of the Miami-Dade County Youth Commission, which has been working with local youth groups to stress a peaceful reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to be the example to the world because the whole world is watching us,&quot; Bruno said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruno spoke after a Community Relations Board meeting this week that drew several hundred people to a Miami Gardens library auditorium, some of them wearing &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; T-shirts and many asking sharp-edged questions about the trial. Still, the overall theme was peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please, no violence. We don't want any violence. None,&quot; said Miriam Martin, one of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's aunts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One potential advantage mentioned by several law enforcement officials: school is out for summer, meaning there is no ready-made rallying point for young people to gather.</SPAN></P>
