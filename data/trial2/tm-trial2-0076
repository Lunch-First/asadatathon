<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyonc[#xfffd], Jay-Z and A Tribe Called Quest also pay tribute to the 17-year-old shot dead by George Zimmerman <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The soul singer Lester Chamberswas allegedly assaulted at a concert on Saturday night, after he dedicated a song to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Hours after George Zimmerman was acquitted for Martin's murder, the leader of the Chambers Brothers was attacked by a woman shouting: &quot;It's all your fault.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Contra Costa Times, the incident occurred midway through Chambers' performance at the Hayward-Russell City Blues festival, in California. Introducing a cover of Curtis Mayfield's People Get Ready, Chambers said that if Mayfield were still alive, the lyric &quot;there's a train a-comin'&quot; would be changed to &quot;there's a change a-comin'&quot;, in response to Martin's death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost immediately Dinalynn Andrews Potter leapt on to the stage - &quot;like an acrobat&quot;, according to Chambers' wife. &quot;She had a crazed look in her eye,&quot; a witness told the Times. &quot;I saw the devil there.&quot; She shoved the singer before anyone else could react; Chambers, 73, was eventually taken to hospital, receiving treatment for &quot;bruised rib muscle and nerve damage&quot;. Andrews Potter, 43, was arrested and charged with suspicion of battery, while Chambers &quot;will be up and running soon&quot;, according to his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many other musicians paid tribute to Martin this weekend, albeit in more peaceful circumstances. Beyonc[#xfffd] took the stage in Nashville 30 minutes after the jury in Florida had returned with its ruling, ending the three-week trial. Under low lights, she asked the audience to &quot;have a moment of silence for Trayvon&quot;. Following a long pause, she performed a solemn rendition of the chorus from I Will Always Love You, then transitioned into her hit Halo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following night, Beyonc[#xfffd]'s husband offered his own homage to the 17-year-old. Jay-Z took a few seconds amid the glitz and thump of his final Wireless festival set, saying, &quot;Rest in peace, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; The rapper had previously criticised the coverage of Zimmerman's trial, complaining to Hot 97 that TV networks were reducing justice to &quot;entertainment&quot;. &quot;CNN is almost like TMZ,&quot; he said. &quot;It's really all for ratings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Wireless's other performers, A Tribe Called Quest, dedicated their entire set to Martin. &quot;I don't want to be a downer but yesterday, in America, we saw a miscarriage of justice,&quot; Q-Tip said on Sunday. &quot;It's not the first time this has happened. Pray for us ... we need help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other musicians responded to the jury's decision over Twitter. &quot;Shit [don't] change, and I may never get to see it do so. I pray 4my kids &amp; yours,&quot; wrote Lil Wayne. &quot;Bullshit!&quot; tweeted Chris Brown. Rihanna called it &quot;the saddest news ever&quot;, while Miley Cyrus said she felt &quot;sick&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Black parents hug your sons right tonight. Let them know their value. This ain't a black or white thing this is a wrong and right thing,&quot; wrote Talib Kweli, while Solange Knowles suggested: &quot;We have to somehow turn this anger &amp; pain into peaceful productivity.&quot; But Lupe Fiasco said he accepted the not guilty verdict. &quot;Nobody knows what really happened except Trayvon and Zimmerman,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The justice system relies on reasonable doubt not our emotions ... Emotional reactions to a perceived injustice will get you nowhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was arrested and charged in April 2012, 44 days after shooting Martin dead. The jury of six women agreed with Zimmerman's contention that he had acted out of self-defence, believing that the hoodie-clad teen was going to kill him. On Saturday, Martin's father said he was &quot;brokenhearted&quot; by the decision.</SPAN></P>
