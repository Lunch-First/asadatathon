MORE than a year ago, black leaders and activists took to the streets throughout Florida and the nation to protest the police investigation of the killing of Trayvon Martin and push for the prosecution of neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. 
With the jury in Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial expected to start deliberating today, many of those same leaders - church elders and community activists - are now joining hands with law enforcement officials in Sanford, South Florida, and elsewhere to urge people to remain calm if Mr Zimmerman is found not guilty.
``We've been spending a fair amount of time trying to figure out what our role should be in this, how to keep the peace and, if it turns out the worst-case scenario, what our next moves should be,'' said Derek Turner, spokesman for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which, coincidentally, is holding its annual convention this weekend in Orlando.
``We're all in the back of our minds waiting on edge to hear a verdict.''
Mr Zimmerman, who is half-Hispanic, allegedly shot Martin, a hoodie-wearing black 17-year-old who was unarmed, last year on a drizzly February 26 night in a gated community near Orlando.
Citing Florida's stand-your-ground law, however, Sanford police originally did not charge Mr Zimmerman.
Only after social media outrage and civil rights protests alleging racial profiling and discrimination did Governor Rick Scott appoint a special prosecutor, who brought the charges against Zimmerman six weeks after the shooting.
