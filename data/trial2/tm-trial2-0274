<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to Florida neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman being cleared of all charges in the much-publicized shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a group of Boulderites will hold a prayer vigil tonight on the Pearl Street Mall.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vigil is for Martin's family and the &quot;future of race relations in Boulder,&quot; said Jen Watson, who organized the event. It will be from 6 to 8 p.m. in front of the county courthouse at Pearl and 14th streets.<BR><BR> &quot;We need to remember his family and pray for the soul of America,&quot; Watson wrote in an e-mail prior to the event.<BR><BR> Zimmerman was acquitted by a jury Saturday in the shooting of Martin, the unarmed black teenager whose killing has set off a debate about racial profiling. Zimmerman could have been convicted of second-degree murder or manslaughter.<BR><BR> Rev. Donald Matthews, a faculty member of religious studies at Naropa University, will help lead the event, Watson said.<BR><BR> In a statement prior to the event, Matthews and Watson said: &quot;There is also a strong observation that racism is still well alive in Boulder, given numerous events over the years.  The occurrence and continuation of racism is still affecting the lives of persons of different ethnicity every day in Boulder, in ways that many Boulderites will never understand.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
