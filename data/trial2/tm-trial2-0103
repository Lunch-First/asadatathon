<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands protested in US cities overnight as President Barack Obama appealed for calm following the acquittal in Florida of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager. <BR>The angry protests highlight simmering racial tensions after a jury found volunteer watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering 17 year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, AFP reported.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators held noisy rallies in US cities including New York, San Francisco, Boston, Detroit and Chicago. <BR>At least six people were arrested in Los Angeles early Monday when riot police broke up an &quot;unlawful assembly&quot; in Hollywood near the CNN building. <BR>To the chants of &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; a separate crowd blocked traffic on an important freeway elsewhere in the giant metropolis, local media reported. <BR>Memories are still fresh of the deadly April 1992 riots in Los Angeles, which broke out after a similar racially-tinged trial. <BR>The biggest rally Sunday was in New York City, where several thousand -- including families with children -- marched to Times Square under the watchful eye of police. <BR>Many in the multi-racial crowd brandished signs bearing a portrait of Martin, while some, despite sweltering July heat, wore &quot;hoodie&quot; sweatshirts as the teen did the night he was killed. <BR>&quot;I am appalled,&quot; said Carli VanVoorhis, a 21-year-old hairdresser. <BR>&quot;The man was armed, the kid was not, and the man with the gun got away,&quot; she said. &quot;If we say it was not a racial issue, we would be lying.&quot; <BR>&quot;We have a big problem with race, and another problem is guns,&quot; said protester Rodney Rodriguez. &quot;If Zimmerman didn't have a gun, he couldn't have killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; <BR>Fellow protester Derreck Wilson, 46, said the group had come &quot;to say in a peaceful way why we are angry. We are angry, scared and anxious.&quot; <BR>&quot;It's cathartic,&quot; he said. <BR>&quot;We all have the same desires. I want to be able to have my son to come home,&quot; added Wilson, who came to the protest from the traditionally African-American neighborhood of Harlem. <BR>The case has pitted those who believe that Zimmerman, a 29-year-old Hispanic neighborhood watchman, killed Martin in self-defense, and those who believe it was a murder sparked by racist assumptions. <BR>Obama, the first black US president, urged Americans to step back and accept the trial verdict. <BR>&quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,&quot; the president said in a statement. &quot;I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was accused of pursuing Martin through a gated community in the town of Sanford and shooting him during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, 2012. <BR>The defense successfully argued that Zimmerman fired his handgun in self-defense after the teen wrestled him to the ground and was slamming his head against the pavement. <BR>According to Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, people who fear for their lives can use deadly force to defend themselves without having to flee a confrontation. <BR>&quot;We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this,&quot; Obama said. &quot;As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; <BR>Obama last year spoke emotionally about the case, noting that if he had a son he would &quot;look like Trayvon.&quot; <BR>The racial divide was evident in Sanford pastor Valerie Houston's Sunday sermon. <BR>&quot;Dr (Martin Luther) King (Jr) stated, the daily life of the Negro is still in the basement of the Great Society,&quot; she said. &quot;And today I state, the daily life of my people is still enslaved to a white supremacist society.&quot; <BR>Martin's parents -- father, Tracy, and mother Sybrina Fulton -- asked the public before the verdict to respect the trial outcome, and afterwards gave thanks for the outpouring of support they received over the past year. <BR>Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump declined to say whether they would file a civil lawsuit against Zimmerman, but said &quot;they are going to certainly look at that as an option.&quot;</SPAN></P>
