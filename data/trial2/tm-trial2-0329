<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women were crying and the college students were chanting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a few minutes had passed since the not guilty verdict had made its way down to the front lawn of the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center. The crowd was buzzing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many had been here since early Saturday, on a day that seemed to alternate between harmonious, tense, absurd and back again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, in the glare of the television lights and the realization of the verdict, curses and wails filled the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing in the middle of all this was a 38-year-old Tampa man with his arms crossed and his expression blank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not mad. I'm not upset. I've been expecting this for months and months,'' said Life Malcolm. &quot;There's a long history, a long pattern, of white people killing black men and then coming to some court of law and being found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's always our fault. We shouldn't have reached for our wallet. We shouldn't have gotten out of the car. We shouldn't have been where we didn't belong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe this was justice. They had a trial, and a jury made a decision. (Defense attorney) Mark O'Mara even said this should help us believe in the system. But why doesn't the system ever work for the black man? It may work for you, but it's killing us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like it or not, this was justice. And the system was fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury listened to two weeks' worth of testimony and determined there was not enough hard evidence to conclude George Zimmerman wasn't acting in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that doesn't mean anyone with Malcolm's point of view is wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For even if you believe the verdict itself had nothing to do with race, this whole tragic episode began because Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had the misfortune of being a black teenager in the wrong neighborhood on the wrong night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That reality seems inescapable. Zimmerman called 911 and eventually crossed paths with Martin not because the teenager had done anything wrong, but because he vaguely matched the profile of suspects in recent neighborhood burglaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the same profile - a young black man - that had led Zimmerman to call 911 multiple other times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if the truth about the actual confrontation remains in doubt, the moments leading up to it are all too clear. It was Zimmerman who incorrectly decided Martin was suspicious. It was Zimmerman who did not listen to a police dispatcher. It was Zimmerman who got out of his vehicle. And it was Zimmerman carrying a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was racism from the beginning, and it continued through the trial,'' said Walt Byars, 27, of Tampa. &quot;They tried to make Trayvon look like a thug. They tried to make it sound like he was the one who was out looking for trouble. He was a teenager out for a walk, and now he's dead and a murderer is free.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few of us, it seems, have come to this case with an open mind. We believed in Zimmerman's guilt or innocence, and we tended to hear only the evidence that supported our intractable positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that reason, we need to have faith in the six women on the jury. We need to believe they viewed the facts dispassionately and considered the judge's instructions carefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't mean you have to agree with them. And that doesn't mean we don't still have miles to go with race relations in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For if we learned anything from this trial and the debates it spawned, it is that many of us still have a difficult time seeing the world through the eyes of our neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This whole thing began with a teenager lying dead on a rainy night, and an armed man insisting that a fatal shot was his only choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It finally ended late Saturday, nearly 17 months later, with a crowd outside the courthouse protesting a jury's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's the lessons learned in between that, hopefully, we won't forget.</SPAN></P>
