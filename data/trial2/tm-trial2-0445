<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WANNA-BE COP George Zimmerman opted not to take the stand Wednesday as the defense rested in his second-degree murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; Zimmerman replied when Judge Debra Nelson asked him if he intended to testify in his own behalf. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered when the judge asked if this was his final decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that, defense attorney Mark O'Mara asked Nelson once again to acquit Zimmerman, arguing that prosecutors failed to prove he deliberately killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson said no and that she would leave it for the jury to decide 29-year-old Zimmerman's fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors could get the case as early as Friday, after both sides make their closing arguments in a racially charged case that has transfixed much of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors contend Zimmerman is a vigilante who profiled Martin and tailed him against a dispatcher's advice before killing the unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say Zimmerman, who ran the neighborhood watch at the townhouse complex outside Orlando, was frustrated over a recent rash of break-ins and over his thwarted career as a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's lawyers say he shot Martin in the chest in self-defense after the teen jumped him and began pounding his head on the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of the most surreal moments of the trial, O'Mara straddled a life-sized dummy Wednesday and smashed its head on the courtroom floor while the jury looked on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Would the injuries on Mr. Zimmerman, the back of his head, be consistent with someone doing this on cement?&quot; O'Mara asked John Root, a public safety consultant who was on the stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then O'Mara slammed the dummy's flopping head on the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think so,&quot; Root replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this?&quot; O'Mara asked. &quot;How about someone resisting the attack? Could that have come from if someone was resisting me pushing down like this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe so,&quot; Root said.</SPAN></P>
