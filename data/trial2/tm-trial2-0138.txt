  Giants star Victor Cruz yesterday admitted he dropped the ball by predicting George Zimmerman would be dead within a year from vigilante justice.  
  The popular, squeaky-clean wide receiver apologized for the ominous tweet, posted moments after Florida jurors acquitted the neighborhood-watch volunteer in the killing of Trayvon Martin.
  "My tweet last night was my initial interpretation of the reaction I was reading on Twitter," Cruz wrote yesterday. "I immediately realized my tweet was a mistake, and I apologize. That's why I deleted it."  
  The day before, Cruz had tweeted: "Thoroughly confused. Zimmerman doesn't last a year before the hood catches up to him." 
  In his much more conciliatory later tweet, Cruz said the tragedy of Martin's death should spark more dialogue and less violence.  
   "I believe conversation not confrontation leads to change and progress," Cruz wrote. 
  "I never have and never advocate violence under any circumstances and I pray that we all encourage and educate each other."  
  Cruz added that he has only kind thoughts for the victim's loved ones, saying, "My prayers continue to go out to Trayvon Martin's family." 
  A Giants spokesman said the team had no role in Cruz's decision to remove the offending tweet or his apology.
