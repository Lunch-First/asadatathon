<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A county religious leader is asking for calm upon the announcement of a verdict in the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin murder trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larry Lee Thomas, a bishop in Glen Burnie's Empowering Believers Church of the Apostolic Faith, has asked Anne Arundel county residents to &quot;respect the laws of the land&quot; once a verdict is announced. Zimmerman has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of 17-year old Martin in 2012. Jurors are scheduled to resume deliberations in the case Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the lines that are being drawn concerning guilty or not guilty, we're just asking that, no matter what the verdict, people allow the system of justice to be the voice,&quot; Thomas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Christian Clergy Alliance, North County Christian Clergy, Churches United Cluster, and the NAACP joined Thomas in his message of prayer and peace in anticipation of the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas did not say if he favored a guilty or not-guilty verdict, only that he hoped &quot;justice will prevail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what's on trial now,&quot; he said, &quot;the justice system and do we have that justice system in place that we can as a people agree on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
