<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Americans are more politically divided than ever, the media may have a lot to do with that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Gallup Poll indicates that 55 percent of Americans get most of their news from television - where news is pretty much sliced and diced to suit particular points of view. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On CNN recently, for instance, anchor Suzanne Malveaux went to great lengths to rehabilitate the prosecution of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. When a friend of Zimmerman's testified that she recognized his screams on the infamous 911 call because she'd worked with him on a political campaign, Malveaux suggested the prosecution could claim that Zimmerman's enthusiastic cries at a political rally might be similar to ones uttered while &quot;pummeling Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot; with &quot;a sense of joy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A guest had to remind Malveaux that the screaming voice on the 911 call wasn't one of jubilation, but of cries for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why was Malveaux so intent on propping up the prosecution of George Zimmerman? Her CNN colleague Piers Morgan appeared to share her zeal for Zimmerman's scalp. Why -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">especially when the evidence is unclear, at best, who was besting whom in that fateful fight - and when there is some pretty compelling evidence that Zimmerman was the one being pummeled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, whereas Zimmerman's facial and head injuries are well-documented, with ABC News long ago reporting Zimmerman sustained a broken nose, two black eyes and cuts to the back of the head, CBS News long ago reported that, &quot;Wounds found on (Martin's) knuckles may support George Zimmerman's claim that the unarmed teenager assaulted him before he was fatally shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most fair-minded observers have predicted an acquittal in the case, because of the conflicting evidence and, in fact, to evidence buttressing Zimmerman's account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a legal matter, I just don't see how a jury convicts him of second-degree murder or even manslaughter in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; writes ABC legal analyst Dan Abrams. &quot;...(I)f they follow the letter of the law, it's hard to see, based on everything we know now, how they find him guilty of either murder or even manslaughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If an already restive core of Martin supporters gets all its news from CNN, they would be shocked by an acquittal - and perhaps angered into lashing out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's the little-watched but incendiary MSNBC - which a former producer there wrote recently behaves at times like the &quot;official network of the Obama White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gallup itself fretted that its poll showing such a reliance on such an opinionated set of news channels &quot;documents the balkanization of news&quot; - meaning that Americans are digesting very different information on the same events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't help that in broadcast news, the line between news and opinion has been,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for the most part, erased. Supposed news anchors now openly advocate for certain public policy positions - and, it seems, certain verdicts in high-profile trials.</SPAN></P>
