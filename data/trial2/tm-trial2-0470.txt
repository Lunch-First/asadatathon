We asked our followers on Twitter if they were on the Zimmerman jury, what their verdict would be.
Zimmerman's story is unlikely. He wrongfully killed Martin. But defense is creating reasonable doubt. Without lesser charge, we're left with not guilty. 
@josemcyntire
He was told to stand down when he made the 911 call. He didn't. He's guilty! End of story.
@WeirdArchives
I believe it was classic self-defense, and I think the facts are proving it.
@Yerkulez
There's no evidence to show he did anything wrong. Case dismissed.
@McHaleFrank
I think he's guilty of manslaughter.

I was on citizen's watch years ago, and we were told under no circumstances should we get out of our car. Our job was only to observe and report. If George Zimmerman had not gotten out of his car to follow TrayvonMartin, none of this would have happened. A 17-year-old was walking home, minding his own business and talking on his cellphone. Then, an armed Zimmerman decided to follow Trayvon. Is this standing one's ground and asserting self-defense? I think not. Had Zimmerman stayed in his car, none of this would have happened. Zimmerman must be held responsible.
