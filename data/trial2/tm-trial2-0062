<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLICE were last night on alert for a backlash in US cities after a jury cleared a man of shooting dead a black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbourhood watch member George Zimmerman killed 17-yearold Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as the unarmed youngster was walking home through a gated community at night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, claimed he fired in self-defence after being attacked by the teenager, while critics branded him a &quot;wannabe cop&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida killing polarised American society down racial lines after police waited six weeks before arresting Zimmerman, with President Barack Obama declaring that if he had a son, &quot;he'd look like Trayvon&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder and also manslaughter by a jury of six women following a televised trial at a Florida courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict drew jeers from crowds outside the court building, while peaceful protests took place in Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, California, marchers vandalised a police car and tried to start fires in the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon died in Sanford, a town of 54,000 people on the outskirts of Orlando, in February last year. The teenager, who studied aviation and dreamed of becoming a pilot or engineer, died from a single gunshot wound to the heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments before the shooting, Zimmerman, armed with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol, called police to say he had spotted a suspicious figure in the neighbourhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Perkins, 55, a black resident of Sanford, angrily asked outside the courthouse: &quot;How the hell did they find him not guilty? &quot;He killed somebody and got away with murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an effort to defuse tensions, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson tweeted his despair at the decision, But he added: &quot;Avoid violence, it will lead to more tragedies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow anti-racism activist Rev Al Sharpton said the verdict was &quot;a slap in the face to the American people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
