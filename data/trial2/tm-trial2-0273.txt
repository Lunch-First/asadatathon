THE CITY'S mayoral candidates quickly weighed in on the TrayvonMartin case Saturday night, with many taking to Twitter to denounce George Zimmerman's acquittal in the death of the black Florida teenager. 
Democrat Bill Thompson, the only African-American in the mayoral race, tweeted that "TrayvonMartin was killed because he was black. There was no justice done today in Florida."
Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate, blasted the jury's verdict as "a slap in the face to justice. TrayvonMartin's death was a terrible tragedy."
And City Council Speaker Christine Quinn (D-Manhattan) called the not-guilty verdict "a shocking insult to his family and everyone seeking justice for Trayvon."
Democrat Anthony Weiner sent out this tweet: "Keep Trayvon's family in our prayers. Deeply unsatisfying verdict. Trial by jury is our only choice in a democracy."
Controller John Liu, also was critical. "Today's decision is shocking and highlights the sad reality that the day of equal justice for Trayvon and millions of other young men of color has yet to arrive," he said.
But there also was a reaction to the reaction.
City Councilman Jumaane Williams (D-Brooklyn), who has been at the forefront of the citywide debate over stop-and-frisk policing, sent what might have been one of the more provocative messages on twitter: "I took a nap and I woke up still just a colored, negro, n----- male in America, land of my birth."
