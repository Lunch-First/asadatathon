<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI (AP) Police and city leaders in Florida say are preparing for the possibility of mass protests or even civil unrest if a neighborhood watch volunteer is acquitted in the killing of an unarmed black teen a case that has already provoked protests after police initially refused to arrest the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, was visiting his father and father&quot;s fiancee when George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, fatally shot him during a physical confrontation in a gated community in February 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin&quot;s supporters portrayed the shooting as racially motivated, while Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, claimed self-defense. Charged with second-degree murder, Zimmerman is pleading not guilty at the trial unfolding in a Sanford courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After police failed to charge Zimmerman for 44 days, there were many large but peaceful protests in Florida as well as in New York and other cities. Those demonstrations included a mass walkout at nearly three dozen Florida high schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, Florida officials have been working with pastors, youth coaches, community activists and summer camp counselors to stress a non-violent approach if Zimmerman walks free. At the same time, police say they have quietly been making plans for dealing with any potential emotional flare-ups that could quickly turn into storefront-smashing, car-burning riots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It&quot;s all right to be vocal, but we don&quot;t want to be violent,&quot; said the Rev. Walter T. Richardson, a longtime pastor and chairman of Miami-Dade County&quot;s Community Relations Board, which has been holding town hall-style meetings about the case. &quot;We&quot;ve already lost one soul and we don&quot;t want to lose any more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in Sanford say they doubt the trial&quot;s outcome would spark local residents to take to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main focus was to get Zimmerman arrested and have him tried before a jury of his peers in a court of law,&quot; said Clayton Turner Jr., president of the Seminole County branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. &quot;That was the main issue, not how we felt about whether he&quot;s innocent or guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone is so certain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shantree Hall, 37, who is black, said a Zimmerman acquittal might anger many in the African-American community who already feel they are less likely to obtain justice. The protests that led to Zimmerman&quot;s arrest taught many people that was the only way to get things done, she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With Trayvon, the noise was too loud for them. That&quot;s why they couldn&quot;t sweep it under the rug,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent Miami-area high school graduate Jude Bruno, 18, said he doesn&quot;t sense from friends and peers that there is a powder keg waiting to explode should Zimmerman be found not guilty. Bruno is chairman of the Miami-Dade County Youth Commission, which has been working with local youth groups to stress a peaceful reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to be the example to the world because the whole world is watching us,&quot; Bruno said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruno spoke after a Community Relations Board meeting this week that drew several hundred people to a Miami Gardens library auditorium, some of them wearing &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; T-shirts and many asking sharp-edged questions about the trial. Still, the overall theme was peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please, no violence. We don&quot;t want any violence. None,&quot; said Miriam Martin, one of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot;s aunts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One potential advantage mentioned by several law enforcement officials: school is out for summer, meaning there is no ready-made rallying point for young people to gather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, authorities are taking no chances, particularly in the Miami area which has had riots in the past connected to racially-charged court cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worst rioting occurred in 1980 in the mostly-black Liberty City and Overtown neighborhoods of Miami, after four white police officers were acquitted in the death of Arthur McDuffie, a black Marine Corps veteran. McDuffie was beaten to death by police trying to stop him for a traffic violation. The three-day riot killed 18 people and did some $100 million in damage.</SPAN></P>
