TRAYVON Martin spent four minutes preparing to attack George Zimmerman, a court was told yesterday.
Zimmerman, 29, is charged with murder after shooting dead the unarmed black 17-yearold in a confrontation in February 2012. 
Neighbourhood watch coordinator Zimmerman claimed he shot Martin in self-defence after being attacked.
But prosecutors contend Zimmerman was a "wannabe cop" who tracked down the teen and shot him without justification in Sanford, Florida.
They contend it was Martin who feared for his safety.
Prosecutor John Guy said: "Was that child not in fear when he was running from that defendant?" To convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder - a charge that could lead to a sentence of life in prison - the jury must find he acted with ill will, spite or hatred.
