<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GEORGE Zimmerman may have been acquitted of the killing of Trayvon Martin, but he is now ``a dead man walking''. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman was forced into hiding after receiving hundreds, perhaps thousands, of death threats after he was identified as the man who shot dead the unarmed 17-year-old in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he is a free man but his lawyers said he must stay in hiding because ``several fringe groups'' refused to accept the jury's verdict that Mr Zimmerman acted within the law when he killed Mr Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the case forced Florida Governor Rick Brown to establish a panel to review Florida's Stand Your Ground law -- the statute that allows anyone to use deadly force if he has a reasonable fear of death or grave bodily injury -- the panel recommended no major changes. Lawyers and consultants who have worked in similar cases said Mr Zimmerman's life would not return to normal any time soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He should, they added, abandon his ambitions of becoming a police officer because his reputation has become far too divisive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``This is something that will follow George Zimmerman forever,'' defence lawyer Don West said at a press conference shortly after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
