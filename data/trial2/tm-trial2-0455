<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Florida (AP) Closing arguments were set to begin Thursday in a U.S. murder trial that raised issues of race and self-defense gun laws over a deadly confrontation between a neighborhood watch volunteer and an unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman&quot;s defense attorneys rested their case Wednesday. Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, saying he shot Trayvon Martin in self-defense during a nighttime scuffle in February 2012 in his gated community, where Martin was visiting family. Zimmerman did not testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge said the case could be sent to jurors late Thursday or Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case drew national protests after some civil rights activists argued that the 44-day delay in arresting Zimmerman was influenced by Martin&quot;s race. Martin was black and Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors have seen repeated video recordings of Zimmerman telling his side of the story to police investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One key question has been whether it was Martin or Zimmerman heard screaming for help on a police call that captured their fatal fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys called Zimmerman&quot;s friends, parents and uncle to testify that it was Zimmerman screaming. Martin&quot;s mother and brother had testified that it was Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Determining who screamed would help jurors evaluate Zimmerman&quot;s self-defense claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutor John Guy also used a life-sized foam mannequin in front of the jury to simulate the body positions of Zimmerman and Martin at the time of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Mark O&quot;Mara told reporters that Zimmerman wanted to testify but his attorneys felt he had already told his version of events in multiple police interviews played for jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he really wanted to be able to interact with this jury and say to them &quot;This is what I did and this is why I did it. And as importantly, this is what was happening to me at the time that I decided to do what I had to do,&quot;&quot; O&quot;Mara said. &quot;So in that sense, yes, I think he wanted to tell his story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
