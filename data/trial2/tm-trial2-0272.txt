@BTraymartin9
Even though I am broken hearted my faith is unshattered I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MY BABY TRAY

@BillThompsonNYC
TrayvonMartin was killed because he was black. There was no justice done today in Florida.
*
@ChrisCQuinn
Today's acquittal is a shocking insult to his family and everyone seeking justice for Trayvon.

@anthonyweiner
Keep Trayvon's family in our prayers. Deeply unsatisfying verdict. Trial by jury is our only choice in a democracy.

@icecube
The TrayvonMartin verdict doesn't surprise me. Stanford, FL never wanted Zimmerman arrested. Now he's free to kill another child.

@MMFlint
Had a gun-toting TrayvonMartin stalked an unarmed George Zimmerman, and then shot him to death... DO I EVEN NEED TO COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
*
@realDonaldTrump
Zimmerman is no angel but the lack of evidence and the concept of self-defense, especially in Florida law, gave the jury little other choice

@ocnnreport
Ponder this. Plaxico Burress mistakenly shot himself and went to jail. Zimmerman killed a kid and he is a free man.

@UncleRUSH I know many people are very upset about the verdict, but we must remain peaceful. No matter what, remain peaceful.

@rihanna

@DwyaneWade
How do I explain this to my young boys????

@Victor Cruz @TeamVic
Thoroughly confused. Zimmerman doesn't last a year before the hood catches up to him.

@ochocinco
Zimmerman is a free man but is he really FREE...

@JustinTuckNYG9
I really don't know if what I'm feeling right now is anger or just pure sadness. #JusticeforTrayvonMartin

@deBlasioNYC
TrayvonMartin's death was a terrible tragedy. This decision is a slap in the face to justice. #nojusticefortrayvon
