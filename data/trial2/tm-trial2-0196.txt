About 125 people gathered at a vigil for Trayvon Martin on Sunday evening at Shir Tikvah synagogue in south Minneapolis. Speakers during the 45-minute service called the not guilty verdict for George Zimmerman a heart-breaking injustice."Maybe they had to follow the law, but it's still unfair," said Cameron Kinghorn, a University of Minnesota student, referring to the jury's decision. Rabbi Michael Latz said that he organized the vigil to allow people to come together and support each other. For more on the vigil, go to www.startribune.com/local
