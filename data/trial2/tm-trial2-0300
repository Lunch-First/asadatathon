<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his final, now unsuccessful argument to the jury deciding the fate of Trayvon Martin's killer, the prosecutor expressed what he thought was a simple &shy;assessment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;This case is not about race,&quot; said John Guy. &quot;It is about right and wrong. It's just that simple.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's not that simple. It never is. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This case became a racial incident the moment George Zimmerman left his car with his gun and stalked an &shy;unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it's not that this kind of thing happens to blacks and people of color all the time that makes this about race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What makes this about race is that it never happens to anyone else. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Who else in The Bronx gets shot at 41 times by cops for reaching for a wallet, like Amadou Diallo did in 1998? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Who else gets gunned down behind the wheel of his car in Queens on his wedding day like Sean Bell did in 2006? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And who else gets racially profiled every day when they are stopped and frisked all over New York City? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  White immigrants don't come to America to get killed by cops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  White grooms don't get gunned down by detectives on their way home from their bachelor parties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And white teens don't buy Skittles and walk toward home and end up dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today, George Zimmerman is as free as you or me. Actually, a jury said he's &quot;not guilty.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He'll probably never be free. </SPAN></P>
