<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HAYWARD -- A woman was arrested Saturday after allegedly jumping on stage at a music festival and attacking a legendary musician after he dedicated a song to Trayvon Martin, according to police and eyewitnesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman, who police identified as 43-year-old Dinalynn Andrews Potter of Barstow, apparently yelled, &quot;it's all your fault&quot; before shoving 73-year-old Lester Chambers, his family said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She had a crazed look in her eye,&quot; said Kurt Kangas, a friend of Chambers who ran to his aid. &quot;I saw the devil there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers was performing at the Hayward Russell City Blues Festival downtown when around 5:15 p.m. he dedicated Curtis Mayfield's hit &quot;People Get Ready&quot; to Martin, the 17-year-old shot and killed by George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman on all charges Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers told the audience if Mayfield were around today, he'd change the lyrics &quot;there's a train a comin'&quot; to &quot;there's a change a comin,'&quot; his wife Lola Chambers told this newspaper Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She must have been an acrobat. She did it in one leap. He didn't see her coming,&quot; Lola Chambers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyewitnesses and Hayward police said people on stage subdued Andrews Potter after she allegedly shoved Chambers. Though the police investigation into a motive continues, family members believe the attack was racially motivated and was a result of Chambers' mention of Martin. The family is pressing police to file hate crime charges. Andrews Potter is white, they said. Chambers is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hayward police took Andrews Potter to the police station, where she was arrested on suspicion of battery. She was cited and released, and could face additional charges in the coming days, according to Hayward police Lt. Ruben Pola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers, a Petaluma resident, was taken to the hospital but has since been released, and is using a cane to walk. A photo his son posted on Facebook shows a large welt on his backside. His son said Chambers had a &quot;bruised rib muscle and nerve damage and he is sore all over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers was a member of the 1960s soul group Chambers Brothers and has had a well-publicized fight with record executives over decades of royalty payments he said he has never received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chambers Brothers will be part of the inaugural class inducted into the R&amp;B Hall of Fame later this year, Lola Chambers said.</SPAN></P>
