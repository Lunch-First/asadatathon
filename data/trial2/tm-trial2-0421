<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for George Zimmerman rested their case yesterday without calling the former neighbourhood watch volunteer to testify, setting up the final stages of his closely watched murder trial for the shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida last year. &quot;After consulting with counsel, (I have decided) not to testify, your honour,&quot; Zimmerman said to questions from Seminole County Judge Debra Nelson. It was a rare chance to hear Zimmerman speak, as the overweight 29-year-old sat emotionless throughout most of the proceedings, smartly dressed in suits and ties bought for him by a supporter. </SPAN></P>
