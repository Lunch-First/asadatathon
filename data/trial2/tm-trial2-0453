<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Florida (AP) An expert on gunshot wounds hired by the defense testified Tuesday that a neighborhood watch volunteer&quot;s account of how he fatally shot an unarmed black teen is consistent with the forensic evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Vincent Di Maio said that the trajectory of the bullet and gun powder on Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot;s body support George Zimmerman&quot;s version that Martin was on top of him when Zimmerman fired his gun into Martin&quot;s chest. The gun&quot;s muzzle was against Martin&quot;s clothing and it was anywhere from two to four inches from Martin&quot;s skin, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is consistent with Mr. Zimmerman&quot;s account that Mr. Martin was over him, leaning forward at the time he was shot,&quot; said Di Maio, the former chief medical examiner in San Antonio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was unarmed when he was fatally shot by Zimmerman in February 2012 in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Martin was black and Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic; some activists argued that the initial delay in charging Zimmerman was influenced by Martin&quot;s race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pathologist also said it was likely Martin was conscious for 10 to 15 seconds after the shooting as a reserve supply of oxygen ran out of his body, and during that time it was possible for him to have moved his arms. Zimmerman&quot;s account that he had placed Martin&quot;s arms out to his sides after the shooting contradicts a photo taken after the shooting that shows Martin&quot;s arms under his body. Defense attorneys contend Martin moved his arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Di Maio testified that lacerations to the back Zimmerman&quot;s head were consistent with his head striking a concrete sidewalk. Later, when looking at photos of Zimmerman&quot;s injuries taken the night of the shooting, Di Maio identified six separate impacts to Zimmerman&quot;s face and head. He said a nose injury could have come from being punched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Di Maio also explained that if clothes taken into evidence are wet and packaged in plastic bags, and not paper bags, it can ruin the samples since &quot;bacteria multiplies and you get mold and it stinks to high heaven.&quot; Defense attorneys believe DNA evidence found on Martin&quot;s hooded sweatshirt and undershirt was degraded since the clothing wasn&quot;t packaged properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the morning, Judge Debra Nelson considered prosecutors&quot; request to bar the defense from showing animation depicting the fight between Martin and Zimmerman. After hearing more than five hours of arguments, Nelson said she would issue a ruling on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors object to the animation, saying it&quot;s an inaccurate depiction and will confuse jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys called the man who created the animation to testify. To recreate the fight, Daniel Schumaker went to the crime scene and had employees in motion-capture suits re-enact what happened based on coroner photographs, police reports, the coroner&quot;s report, witness depositions and photos taken by responding police officers, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight took place on a dark, rainy night in February 2012 and there were no eyewitnesses who saw the entire fight. Several witnesses saw and heard parts of the struggle that left Martin dead with a bullet in his heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys also tried to get Martin&quot;s text messages and a Facebook posting dealing with fighting introduced as evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s attorneys called computer analyst Richard Connor to read to the judge text messages he found on Martin&quot;s cellphone in which he purportedly recounted a fight he had been in to a friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors were out of the courtroom as defense attorneys presented their arguments about the text messages. Nelson had ruled that information about Martin&quot;s interest in guns and fighting couldn&quot;t be used during opening statements, but she had left open the possibility that they could be introduced later. The judge said she would rule Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutor John Guy said jurors shouldn&quot;t be presented with the text messages and photos of a gun found on Martin&quot;s phone, as well as a Facebook posting from a half-brother asking Martin when he was going to teach him how to fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would mislead the jury and be prejudicial,&quot; Guy said. &quot;It doesn&quot;t tell us about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and certainly doesn&quot;t tell us what George Zimmerman knew about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, defense attorney Don West said they were relevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It relates to his physical capabilities, his knowledge of fighting,&quot; West said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testimony in previous days has focused on a police call that captures screams from the struggle between Martin and Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convincing the jury of who was screaming for help on the tape has become the primary goal of prosecutors and defense attorneys because it would help jurors evaluate Zimmerman&quot;s self-defense claim. Relatives of Martin&quot;s and Zimmerman&quot;s have offered conflicting opinions about who is heard screaming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s mother and uncle testified last Friday it was Zimmerman screaming, while Martin&quot;s mother and brother also took the witness stand last Friday to say the voice belongs to Martin. Martin&quot;s father testified Monday that he initially couldn&quot;t tell if the screams came from his son, but later decided they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman himself once said during a police interview that the screams didn&quot;t sound like him, though he and his family later said the screams were his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder and says he shot Martin in self-defense during a scuffle in the townhome complex where he lived. Martin was there visiting his father and his father&quot;s fiancee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors contend that Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, was profiling Martin and perceived the teen as someone suspicious in the neighborhood, which had been the site of a series of break-ins. The case sparked protests because police did not charge Zimmerman for 44 days and it touched off a nationwide debate about race and self-defense.</SPAN></P>
