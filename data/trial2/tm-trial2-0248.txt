I THINK HE'LL probably be found not guilty, but it sure is hard to ignore the fact that ..... but for the actions of George Zimmerman, who did everything contrary to what the 911 operator instructed; who did everything contrary to the training provided by the Sanford, FL police officials to the neighborhood watch group, Trayvon Martin would be alive today. To walk away scot-free just seems wrong.
