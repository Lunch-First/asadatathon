<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l A Recitals listing in the July 12 Weekend section included an incorrect date and time for organist Lawrence Molinaro's performance of the &quot;Goldberg Variations.&quot; Molinaro will perform with Con Brio! on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. and will perform the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; on Sunday at 1:30 p.m. Both recitals will be at Grace Episcopal Church in the District. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l A June 29 A-section article about the George Zimmerman trial incorrectly said that witness Jenna Lauer testified that she saw a person wearing red clothing on top of a dark-clothed person who was calling for help during the fight that preceded the death of Trayvon Martin. Lauer testified that she heard cries for help, but she did not see the fight. The error also appeared in the June 30 early Sunday edition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l An In the Loop item in the June 13 A-section about Avril Haines being chosen to be CIA deputy director rather than State Department legal adviser said the latter position was created in 1931 under Franklin D. Roosevelt. Herbert Hoover was president then.</SPAN></P>
