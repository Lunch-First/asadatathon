<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Florida (AP) The father of a black teenager shot dead in by a U.S. neighborhood watch volunteer said Monday he never denied it was his son&quot;s voice screaming for help on a phone call to police, contradicting officers&quot; testimony at George Zimmerman&quot;s murder trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Monday, the judge ruled that defense attorneys may present evidence that the teen, Trayvon Martin, had marijuana in his system when he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convincing the jury of whose voice is on the phone tapes is important to both sides because it would help jurors decide on the aggressor in the nighttime confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case drew national protests when Zimmerman went without arrest for weeks, and questions have focused on race and self-defense gun laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder and says he shot Martin in self-defense during a scuffle in the gated community where he lived. Martin was there visiting family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors contend that Zimmerman was profiling Martin and perceived the teen as someone suspicious in the neighborhood, which had been the site of a series of break-ins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lead detective in the case, officer Chris Serino, spoke about a meeting with Martin&quot;s father in the days after the black teen was fatally shot by Zimmerman last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serino testified that when Tracy Martin listened to the police recording and was asked if it was his son, Martin said &quot;no,&quot; Serino said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He looked away and under his breath he said &quot;no&quot;,&quot; Serino said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under cross examination, prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda suggested that Martin may have been in denial about his son&quot;s death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could be perceived as denial,&quot; Serino said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teen&quot;s father denied the officer&quot;s account. &quot;I never said that wasn&quot;t my son&quot;s voice,&quot; said Tracy Martin, who added that he concluded it was his son after listening to the call as many as 20 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emergency call captured the confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin shortly before Zimmerman fatally shot the teen. Zimmerman&quot;s mother and uncle have testified it was Zimmerman screaming. Martin&quot;s mother and brother said the voice belonged to Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman himself once said during a police interview that the screams didn&quot;t sound like him, though he and his family later said the screams were his.</SPAN></P>
