UNITED STATES: Civil rights leaders have condemned the acquittal of a  Neighbourhood Watch officer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager. 
George Zimmerman was cleared of the second degree murder and manslaughter of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in a gated community in Florida.
Jurors deliberated for 16 hours before reading out the verdict. Zimmerman, 29, showed no emotion at first, but  later broke into a smile.
Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said: "I remain stunned at the decision. The Department of Justice must intervene."
Benjamin Jealous, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, said he had spoken to senior Justice officials about pursuing federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.
He said: "When you look at comments made by young black men who lived in that neighborhood about how they felt especially targeted by  Zimmerman, there is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young Trayvon." 
Defence lawyers had argued that Martin, 17, attacked Zimmerman in   Sanford, Florida. 
Prosecutors had to prove that Zimmerman committed a crime and that he did not act in self-defence.
