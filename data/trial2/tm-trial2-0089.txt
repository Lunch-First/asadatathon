A FLORIDA jury found neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in a racially charged trial that transfixed the nation.
The trial raised strong passions among those who believed Zimmerman whose father is white and mother is Peruvian had racially profiled Martin, and those convinced the volunteer watchman acted in self-defence. 
Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing Martin, 17, through a gated community in Sanford, Florida, and shooting him during an altercation on a rainy night on February 26, 2012.
The killing led to mass marches in several US cities after police initially declined to press charges against Zimmerman.
Fearing more protests and outbreaks of violence after the verdict, activists and community leaders appealed for calm. Police were out in force in Sanford and the crowd of several hundred gathered outside the courthouse was loud at times, but peaceful.
However, spontaneous protest marches were staged overnight in US cities including San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta.
``Obviously, we are ecstatic with the results. George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defence,'' his lead lawyer Mark O'Mara said after the verdict.
Defence lawyer Don West was even more blunt. ``I think the prosecution of George Zimmerman was disgraceful,'' he said.
Defence lawyers insisted Zimmerman acted in self-defence after Martin wrestled him to the ground and slammed his head on the pavement.
Zimmerman smiled briefly but did not appear emotional as the verdict was read. His family grinned broadly as they sat behind him in court.
According to Florida's controversial ``Stand Your Ground'' law, people who fear for their lives can use deadly force to defend themselves without having to flee a confrontation.
