<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayoral hopeful Bill de Blasio decried racial profiling yesterday but resisted comparisons being made by others between the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy and the killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While his mayoral rivals Anthony Weiner and John Liu drew a direct link between the NYPD's controversial practice and the tactics used by neighborhood-watch volunteer George Zimmerman, de Blasio wouldn't buy that line of logic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think they're very different. George Zimmerman was a vigilante,&quot; de Blasio said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;It's a very different reality. Clearly, Zimmerman had no authority to do what he did.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NYPD critics said Martin's death should fuel their calls for the end of stop-and-frisk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;There are hundreds of thousands of people that have been stopped recently who have done absolutely nothing wrong,&quot; Weiner said after a church service in Staten Island. </SPAN></P>
