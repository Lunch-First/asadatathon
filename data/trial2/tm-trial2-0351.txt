The police chief in Sanford, Fla., called for calm Friday as a jury began weighing the fate of George Zimmerman.
Cecil Smith, a transplanted Chicagoan and an African-American who has been at his post for only about a 100 days, said they are not expecting trouble - but ready for any contingency.
"We're not sure what the verdict will bring out," Smith said. "Allow the judicial system to run its course."
Sheriff Donald Eslinger of Seminole County, Fla., issued a blunt warning.
"We will not tolerate anyone who uses this verdict to violate the law," he said.
