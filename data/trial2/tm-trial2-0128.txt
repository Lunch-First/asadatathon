ZIMMERMAN FREE
LARGE protests broke out at the weekend in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oakland after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin.
Protests in LA and San Francisco drew hundreds but were peaceful, but people marching through Oakland broke windows, spray-painted cars and buildings and attempted to start fires.
Footage from TV helicopters caught demonstrators vandalising a police squad car.
The San Francisco Chronicle said no arrests or injuries were reported in Oakland.
