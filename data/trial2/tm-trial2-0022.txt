AMERICA was placed on alert last night after violence threatened to erupt following the acquittal of a neighbourhood watch volunteer accused of murdering an unarmed black teenager.
City leaders and police appealed for calm after George Zimmerman was allowed to walk free from court after killing teenager Trayvon Martin, pictured, last year.
He fatally shot the 17-year-old during a violent struggle in a gated complex which Zimmerman patrolled in Florida.
