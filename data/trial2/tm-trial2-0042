<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury deliberated for over 15 hours over two days in Florida before reaching their decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They had been given the chance to convict Mr Zimmerman (pictured) of manslaughter but did not do so, despite asking for a clarification of the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors heard two different portraits of Mr Zimmerman and had to decide whether he was a wannabe cop who took the law into his own hands or a well-meaning neighbourhood watch volunteer who shot the unarmed teenager in self-defence because he feared for his life. </SPAN></P>
