<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SIX-WOMAN jury has found neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, in a racially charged trial that transfixed the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Mr Zimmerman, I have signed the judgment that confirms the jury's verdict. Your bond will be released. Your GPS monitor will be cut off when you exit the courtroom over here. And you have no further business with the court,'' Judge Deborah Nelson said soon after the decision was read yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman smiled briefly but did not appear emotional as the verdict was read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His family was grinning broadly as they sat behind him in the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was not present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of journalists and crowds of demonstrators had gathered outside the courthouse in the dark, awaiting the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the demonstrators were chanting ``no justice, no peace''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury had deliberated for more than 16 hours since Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing Martin through a gated community in Sanford, Florida and shooting him during an altercation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyers insisted Mr Zimmerman acted in self-defence after Martin, 17, wrestled him to the ground and started bashing his head into the pavement. Mr Zimmerman faced possible life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury was also instructed to consider an alternative charge of manslaughter, which carries up to a 30-year sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The February 2012 killing ignited widespread controversy after police initially declined to press charges against Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community leaders on Friday had called for calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``If Zimmerman is convicted, there should not be inappropriate celebrations, because a young man lost his life,'' said veteran activist Jesse Jackson. ``If he is not convicted, we should avoid violence.''</SPAN></P>
