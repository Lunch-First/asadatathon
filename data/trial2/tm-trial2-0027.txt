A DAY OF peaceful protests gave way to arrests and bottle-throwing Sunday night as thousands took to the city streets to vent outrage over the verdict in the TrayvonMartin case. 
From a rally at Union Square, demonstrators marched to Times Square and uptown chanting, "No Justice, No Peace!"
For the most part, cops stood by. But at least five protesters were arrested in a clash at Park Ave. and E. 71st St. around 10 p.m.
At E. 79th St. and Second Ave., police in riot gear moved in to arrest two more people for disorderly conduct.
"Move back or I will Mace you," one officer shouted at protesters.
Protest organizers said at least 12 people were arrested as demonstrators continued marching uptown early Monday. "It got chaotic," said one protester, adding that bottles were thrown.
A day after George Zimmerman was found not guilty of killing 17-year-old Trayvon, politicians, preachers and protesters seemed united in the belief that justice was denied.
"I really want this to be about Trayvon," Solange Knowles, sister of Beyonc, told demonstrators at a peaceful rally she organized at Brooklyn Borough Hall on Sunday afternoon.
At Union Square, City Councilman Jumaane Williams (D-Brooklyn) said the verdict sends a message that it's "difficult to be a black man in 2013."
