Beyonc briefly interrupted her concert in Nashville on Saturday night following news of George Zimmerman's acquittal.
The singer's show at the Bridgestone Arena began about 30 minutes after the jury returned, and at one point she asked fans to join her in a "moment of silence for Trayvon". 
Beyonc then sang the chorus of "I Will Always Love You", written by country music star Dolly Parton and brought to a global audience by the late Whitney Houston, before transitioning into her hit "Halo".
Elsewhere, the rapper Young Jeezy posted a new song, "It's a Cold World (A Tribute to Trayvon Martin)" on his Facebook page, while music producer Russell Simmons wrote that he would be supporting the Trayvon Martin Foundation in its efforts to repeal Florida's "Stand Your Ground" law. "God bless you little brother. Rest in peace," he wrote. AP
