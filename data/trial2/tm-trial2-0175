<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 15--Late Saturday night the country found out neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman was cleared of all charges in the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in a Florida community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 17-year-old Martin was an unarmed black teenager who had just gone to the store to buy iced tea and a pack of Skittles, and was heading home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances of the killing, the trial and the verdict set off heated debates about racial profiling and self-defense laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the Rev. Margaret Redmond gave a highly passionate and animated sermon to a congregation of about 30 people at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church about the incident and the verdict reached on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon was a 3.0 student who mentored young children in his community. He didn't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from page 1A ________________________ belong to a gang, he didn't sell drugs and he wasn't even packing no heat,&quot; Redmond said. &quot;Yet he found himself on the wrong end of a gun of a man that feared him so much that he felt obliged not to let him get away with going to the store for some candy and iced tea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redmond preached in frustration, often times yelling her sermon to the congregation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh God, I'm angry. I want to know when we will see justice!&quot; she said emphatically. &quot;I want to know, when do the black and brown bodies stop being strange fruit for a picnic? I'm hurting. My son could be Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. He was doing nothing but being a kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redmond said all that really matters in the case is that a 17-year-old kid was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't care who you were rooting for, Zimmerman or Trayvon, the fact of the matter is Trayvon is still dead and George Zimmerman still killed him,&quot; she said. &quot;The law says Zimmerman is not a murderer but his actions say he is a killer. I don't know what kind of theology he has but I do know that Zimmerman is going to have to live with that thought for the rest of his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redmond told the congregation that what happened to Martin could've happened for a reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps God has taken Trayvon to a better place, a place where there is no profiling, a place where nobody will look at him and think he's just an angry black man,&quot; she said. &quot;Just maybe, God is using Trayvon as our Emmett Till to get us up and do something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
