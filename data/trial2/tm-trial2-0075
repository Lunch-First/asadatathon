<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Child: Film about 2008 shooting of Oscar Grant opens at same time as not guilty verdict in trial of George Zimmerman for killing of unarmed 17-year-old Martin <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Sundance prize-winning film about the real-life shooting of a black man by a white policeman has opened on the same weekendas neighbourhood watch leader George Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale Station won the dramatic grand jury prize and dramatic audience awards at Robert Redford's annual celebration of indie film-making in January. The film's plot echoes the events surrounding Martin's death following a late-night encounter with Zimmerman on 26 February last year. Starring The Wire's Michael B Jordan and Oscar-winner Octavia Spencer (The Help) and directed by 27-year-old first time feature film-maker Ryan Coogler, Fruitvale Station details how 22-year-old Oscar Grant was shot and killed by transport policeman Johannes Mehserle at the Fruitvale train station in Oakland, California, in the early hours of New Year's Day, 2009. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident happened after Mehserle and another officer were called to reports of a fight. The policeman's move to restrain Grant and subsequent decision to shoot him in the back were captured by passers-by on mobile phones. Mehserle was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, though not guilty of second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter, a verdict which sparked protests and small-scale rioting in Oakland. He argued that he had intended to tase Grant, but accidentally shot him after seeing him reach for his waistband. The victim was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale Station is being released by Harvey Weinstein's Weinstein Company in the US and is tipped for Oscars success next year. Weinstein has produced dozens of awards-season favourites over the past 20 years, including the Oscar-winning civil rights themed drama The Help (for which Spencer win best supporting actress) in 2011 and the forthcoming White House-set political biopic The Butler. Coogler's film achieved the highest per-screen average gross of any movie released in the US this weekend, with a take of $54,000 (&pound;36,000) on limited release at seven cinemas. &quot;Obviously, we had no idea of what would be going on at the time we dated the movie, but it's very topical,&quot; said The Weinstein Company's Erik Lomis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan said he almost cancelled an appearance at a sold-out screening at Los Angeles at the weekend following the news of Zimmerman's acquittal. &quot;My heart hurts so bad right now. I wasn't going to come after I found out about George Zimmerman getting acquitted. It broke me up,&quot; he told an audience at the Regal LA Live cinema. &quot;That's why I think this film means so much, because it keeps happening again and again. [We must] learn how to treat each other better and stop judging one another just because we're different. It's not just a black and white thing, it's a people thing. It's the only way that things are going to take the necessary steps to move in the right direction so things can get better because I don't think it's ever gonna stop, but something's gotta fucking change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian's Xan Brooks described Fruitvale Station as a &quot;quietly gripping debut feature&quot; in which &quot;one has the sense of a man being slowly, surely written back into being&quot; after the film's Cannes screening in May. The film is due to expand to six more American cities on Friday before rolling out across the nation the following weekend.</SPAN></P>
