<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major parties offer an appalling values legacy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an expectation that one generation will pass on worthwhile values to the next generation. What values are the major political parties passing on to the next generation? (&quot;Boats, Hopes, Votes&quot;, July, 13-14). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Values such as some people are expendable; some people are just not as important as we are; some people are just ignorant; some people just don't deserve to share our riches; looking after ourselves is the most important thing; concern for the wellbeing of others is of lesser importance; some people are lesser human beings than we are; we can incarcerate them and treat them cruelly; we can deport people and forget them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the values - for which they should be condemned - that underpin the refugee policies of the major political parties, values that they apparently believe are worth passing on to the next generation. Shame!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terry Burke Cammeray</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tools of the trade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David James tells us that few attempts to destroy the English language have been as successful as the strange utterances of management consultants. (&quot;Don't be fooled by the jargon&quot;, July 13-14). David, forget the medication and reading backwards bits. The answer is their ability to mislead and mystify, with a little help from &quot;bullshit baffles brains&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American whistleblower Edward Snowden is reported as saying &quot;individual citizens have the duty to violate domestic laws to prevent crimes against peace and humanity from occurring&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a timely reminder of a declaration by the postwar Nuremberg tribunal of military judges that there was a moral duty to object to the circumstances that could facilitate a crime.</SPAN></P>
