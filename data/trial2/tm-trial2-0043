<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A RACE row raged in the US after a neighbourhood watchman was found not guilty of killing an unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests were sparked in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta when a jury cleared George Zimmerman over the 17-year-old's murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was also acquitted of the lesser manslaughter charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gangs of youths attacked police and torched cars while others smashed windows in a downtown area of Oakland, California. Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in gated community The Retreat in Sanford, Florida, in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman had been driving through the area when he spotted Martin wearing a hoodie walking to a nearby house where he had been staying with friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called the police, claiming Trayvon was behaving suspiciously but before they arrived he confronted the youngster and fired a shot from his 9mm handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was originally released without charge but after a public outcry a murder probe was launched. In court, Zimmerman's lawyers successfully argued he had been acting in self-defence and claimed Trayvon had attacked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tension was raised after the Florida jury took two days and 16 hours to clear the 29-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police and community chiefs urged locals in Sanford to stay calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But rap star P Diddy, 43, voiced his outrage at the verdict, tweeting: &quot;George Zimmerman is free #not right ##NoJusticeForTrayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pop babe Rihanna, 25, also hit out at the decision to free Mr Zimmerman, saying it was &quot;the saddest news ever&quot;.</SPAN></P>
