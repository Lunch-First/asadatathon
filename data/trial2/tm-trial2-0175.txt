July 15--Late Saturday night the country found out neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman was cleared of all charges in the shooting of TrayvonMartin in a Florida community. 
The 17-year-old Martin was an unarmed black teenager who had just gone to the store to buy iced tea and a pack of Skittles, and was heading home.
The circumstances of the killing, the trial and the verdict set off heated debates about racial profiling and self-defense laws.
On Sunday, the Rev. Margaret Redmond gave a highly passionate and animated sermon to a congregation of about 30 people at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church about the incident and the verdict reached on Saturday.
"Trayvon was a 3.0 student who mentored young children in his community. He didn't
from page 1A ________________________ belong to a gang, he didn't sell drugs and he wasn't even packing no heat," Redmond said. "Yet he found himself on the wrong end of a gun of a man that feared him so much that he felt obliged not to let him get away with going to the store for some candy and iced tea."
Redmond preached in frustration, often times yelling her sermon to the congregation.
"Oh God, I'm angry. I want to know when we will see justice!" she said emphatically. "I want to know, when do the black and brown bodies stop being strange fruit for a picnic? I'm hurting. My son could be TrayvonMartin. He was doing nothing but being a kid."
Redmond said all that really matters in the case is that a 17-year-old kid was killed.
"I don't care who you were rooting for, Zimmerman or Trayvon, the fact of the matter is Trayvon is still dead and George Zimmerman still killed him," she said. "The law says Zimmerman is not a murderer but his actions say he is a killer. I don't know what kind of theology he has but I do know that Zimmerman is going to have to live with that thought for the rest of his life."
Redmond told the congregation that what happened to Martin could've happened for a reason.
"Perhaps God has taken Trayvon to a better place, a place where there is no profiling, a place where nobody will look at him and think he's just an angry black man," she said. "Just maybe, God is using Trayvon as our Emmett Till to get us up and do something."
