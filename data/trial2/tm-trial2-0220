<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sanford, fla. George Zimmerman is a relieved man in hiding. Those convinced of his guilt in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin continue to protest his acquittal and other perceived injustices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the trial is over, some people are counseling that it's time to heal and move on. But protests were held across the country Sunday by people who say they can't move on while they feel that the case and the bigger issues of race and justice that it represents are unresolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a jury of six women found Zimmerman not guilty of murder or manslaughter, the conflicting feelings of all those involved hung in the air of the courtroom like heavy fog. Now the question is what those feelings mean for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last year people were very angry, and they came to Sanford to protest because George Zimmerman had not been arrested,&quot; said Norton Bonaparte, Sanford's city manager. &quot;Now he has been arrested. He's been through the trial and a jury has found him not guilty. That's the American judicial system, and from that we move forward.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This central Florida city of more than 50,000 people drew little national attention before Feb. 26, 2012 -- the night neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, encountered black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on a quiet street in a gated community here, some 20 miles northeast of Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes later, Trayvon, 17, was dead of a gunshot wound. Months later, Sanford and Zimmerman, 29, remained the focus of national protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday night and Sunday, there were more demonstrators in Sanford. Most condemned the verdict. Some praised it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued Sunday, President Obama called Trayvon's death a tragedy for America but made no mention of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,&quot; Obama said, &quot;but we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called for calm and national introspection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities,&quot; he said. &quot;We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours after the verdict, Fort Mellon Park, the scene of protests calling for Zimmerman's arrest, was quiet. In Goldsboro, a black neighborhood in Sanford, people stood outside well past midnight discussing what to do next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis Oliver, curator of the Goldsboro Museum, had begun pushing for Trayvon's killer to be arrested the day after the shooting. In her office, she has photos of other young black men killed in Sanford. She says she will enhance her civil engagement by talking to young men about their safety and the danger of being profiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't depend on the system to protect our children,&quot; she said. &quot;When they found Zimmerman not guilty, they also found profiling of black boys not guilty, stereotyping of young black men not guilty, stand your ground against young black men not guilty. We as mothers are going to have to tell them you put on a hoodie, you could be profiled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver noted that citizen action has had results in Sanford: Zimmerman was arrested. Former police chief Bill Lee was fired. The new chief, Cecil Smith, has begun sending officers to meet people in their neighborhoods to build trust. She hopes people will continue to attend community meetings and hold leaders accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some area pastors, preaching love and helping people deal with their feelings is important. The Rev. Venitta Robinson delivered a sermon about God's love at Allen Chapel AME Church in Sanford shortly after her pastor, Valarie Houston, spoke about being hurt by the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The service helped you not to hold onto the anguish, not to hold onto the hurt and the pain,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;You were able to release it knowing that God is in control of everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are hoping to continue the dialogue, continue the conversation and continue the direct action against the system that killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; said Dave Schneider, an organizer with the Coalition for Justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, outside the courthouse where the verdict was read, about 25 demonstrators held signs in support of Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Landau, 24, of Denver, was one of them. Landau, who said he is a social justice advocate, public speaker and poet, said he and others will continue rallies across the country to help people remember Trayvon and what Landau said was a miscarriage of justice in the teen's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The way we prevent future occurrences is raising awareness and getting people more involved,&quot; he said. &quot;There is too much voice and there's not enough action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon may become a modern touchstone for lingering racial discord in the United States nearly 50 years after Martin Luther King delivered his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech at the March on Washington on Aug. 28, 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Trayvon's family, said the teen's death and his killer's acquittal will go down in history with the assassination in 1963 of civil rights leader Medgar Evers, whose murder trial twice ended in a hung jury, and the murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was killed in 1955 after reportedly whistling at a white woman, &quot;as symbols for the fight for equal justice for all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've gone back to a time that we had hoped that our country had gotten past,&quot; said Judith Browne Dianis, co-director of the Advancement Project, a non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C., that advocates for racial equity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stanford University professor Claybourne Carson, who is teaching a course this summer on Martin Luther King, said the case has nothing to do with civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is an important case in terms of how we view the right of citizens to police their neighborhoods in a way that can lead to wrongful death (but less clear is whether) we should be seeing (the verdict) as a major setback in race relations,&quot; Carson said. &quot;I asked the same question about the O.J. Simpson trial. It was a trial in which a lot of light was shed on something that was not representative of very much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal is a wake-up call for African-American youth, said Roslyn Brock, chairwoman of the NAACP, who said she spent Sunday trying to &quot;calm the fear and anxieties and the hurt and the pain&quot; of more than 1,000 black youth gathered in Orlando for the organization's annual convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a pivotal moment in the life of this generation,&quot; she said. &quot;They can't process how can you be walking home from a store and end up dead, and how six women, five mothers, can't find it within the justice system to see that a life has been taken, that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's life had value.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be difficult to predict whether the energy after the trial will be sustained beyond the outrage, whether it becomes an inspirational moment for a generation of African-American young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman verdict came just weeks after the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, and just weeks before the 50th anniversary of King's &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent interview with USA TODAY, the Rev. Bernice King, daughter of Martin Luther King and head of the King Center in Atlanta, said that ruling presents a critical moment -- and an opportunity -- for young African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the generation that is dangerously close to not making their contribution to the freedom struggle,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Atlanta, protesters who would argue they are ready to contribute said the message of the verdict was simple:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young African Americans are not safe in their native land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It reconfirms everything I already knew, but we wanted to think that there was at least a little bit of an improvement,&quot; said Shan Holder, 22. &quot;But when we saw 'not guilty' come across the television screen, we were like, 'Really? Really?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a social moment when we have the responsibility and the opportunity to take a stand and make an impact. We want to direct this energy. We want to impact legislation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
