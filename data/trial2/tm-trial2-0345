<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. (AP) - A jury began deliberating George Zimmerman's fate Friday after hearing dueling portraits of the neighborhood watch captain: a wannabe cop who took the law into his own hands or a well-meaning volunteer who shot Trayvon Martin because he feared for his life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the jury got the case, Zimmerman's lawyers put a concrete slab and two life-size cardboard cutouts in front of the jury box in one last attempt to convince the panel Zimmerman shot the unarmed 17-year-old Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Mark O'Mara used the slab to make the point that it could be used as a weapon. He showed cutouts of Zimmerman, 29, and Martin to demonstrate that the teenager was considerably taller and he displayed a computer-animated depiction of the fight based on Zimmerman's account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said prosecutors hadn't met their burden of proving Zimmerman's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, he said, the murder case was built on &quot;could've beens&quot; and &quot;maybes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it hasn't been proven, it's just not there,&quot; O'Mara said. &quot;You can't fill in the gaps. You can't connect the dots. You're not allowed to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a rebuttal, prosecutor John Guy accused Zimmerman of telling &quot;so many lies.&quot; He said Martin's last emotion was one of fear as Zimmerman followed him in a neighborhood of townhomes on a rainy night Feb. 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that every child's worst nightmare, to be followed on the way home in the dark by a stranger?&quot; Guy said. &quot;Isn't that every child's worst fear?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sequestered jury of six women will have to sort through a lot conflicting testimony from police, neighbors, friends and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, is charged with second-degree murder, but the jury also will be allowed to consider manslaughter. Under Florida's laws involving gun crimes, manslaughter could end up carrying a penalty as heavy as the one for second-degree murder: life in prison.</SPAN></P>
