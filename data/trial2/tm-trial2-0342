<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the jury in Mr Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial expected to start deliberating in Sanford on Friday, many of those same leaders - church elders and community activists - are now joining with police to urge people to remain calm if Mr Zimmerman is found not guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been spending a fair amount of time trying to figure out what our role should be in this; how to keep the peace and, if it turns out the worst-case scenario what our next moves should be,&quot; National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People spokesman Derek Turner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're all waiting on edge to hear a verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coincidentally the association is holding its annual convention in Orlando, not far from the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, who is half- Hispanic, shot the unarmed Martin, a hoodie-wearing black, on a drizzly February 26 night in a gated community near Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, the Sanford police originally did not charge Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was only after social media outrage and civil rights protests alleging racial profiling and discrimination that Governor Rick Scott appointed a special prosecutor, who brought the charges against Mr Zimmerman six weeks after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman's defence before and during the trial has been that he fired the gun in self-defence. If convicted of second-degree murder, the 29-year-old could face life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a late twist in the trial, Judge Debra Nelson said the jury could also consider manslaughter as a lesser charge. This charge is typically included in Florida murder trials at the request of either side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manslaughter with a firearm carries a sentence of up to 30 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Round-the-clock television coverage of the trial has heightened anticipation about the verdict, and anxiety by some about what the reaction to it might be. Authorities have tagged more than 1 million tweets a day related to the trial as it reached its climax this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broward Sheriff Scott Israel released a video this week pleading with people to &quot;raise their voices, not their hands&quot; and to remain calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr Israel and his staff met black pastors and community leaders on Tuesday to enlist their help in avoiding violence after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have no reason to believe there are going to be any issues but forewarned is forearmed,&quot; Mr Israel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Miami Gardens, where Trayvon&nbsp;Martin lived with his mother, Sybrina Fulton, police, lawyers and community leaders also held a pre- emptive forum this week, as they have throughout Miami-Dade County, where the 1980 acquittal of four Miami-Dade police officers in the death of Arthur McDuffie sparked riots in Overtown and Liberty City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sanford, mayor Jeff Triplett does not anticipate violence. But he said: &quot;You always have the anxiety of these butterflies in your stomach of the 'what ifs.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would hate to think it would take on a different vibe than what we've seen in the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His biggest concern was outsiders coming in and causing trouble, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You never know what someone's going to do when they think they're on film or on camera or they've come to a place for one specific purpose and they know nothing else about anything ... That's always a fear. We had that fear last year. That is what keeps me awake at night. Someone coming to our town and saying, 'Watch this'.&quot; Cox Newspapers</SPAN></P>
