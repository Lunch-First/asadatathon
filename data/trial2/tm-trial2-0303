<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors have begun their deliberations in the racially charged trial of a US neighbourhood watch volunteer accused of murderingunarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors retired after defence and prosecution lawyers made closing arguments in a final bid to sway the six-woman panel, which must reach a unanimous verdict to convict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two hours later, the jurors returned to the courtroom to ask the judge and lawyers for a list of the evidence in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury was to resume deliberations yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Judge Debra Nelson reminded jurors that the onus was on prosecutors to prove their case against 29-year-old George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not necessary for George Zimmerman to disprove anything. Nor is George Zimmerman required to prove his innocence,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is up to the state to prove George Zimmerman&quot;s guilt by evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson also reminded jurors that Florida law allowed residents to use lethal force to defend themselves, under the state&quot;s &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The killing of a human being is justifiable and lawful if necessarily done while resisting an attempt to murder or commit a felony upon George Zimmerman, or to commit a felony in any dwelling house in which George Zimmerman was at the time of the attempted killing,&quot; Nelson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s lawyer closed his case by telling jurors that his client feared he was going to die when he shot Martin, 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He&quot;s not guilty of anything but protecting his own life,&quot; Mark O&quot;Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman faces possible life in prison if convicted of second degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors were told they could also consider the lesser charge of manslaughter if they were not convinced he was guilty of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyers rested their case without calling Zimmerman to the witness stand, after three weeks of evidence and testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial has been nationally broadcast on US television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting became a cause celebre last year after authorities initially did not bring charges against Zimmerman, prompting civil rights activists to charge that law enforcement would have pursued the case more zealously had the teenage victim been white.</SPAN></P>
