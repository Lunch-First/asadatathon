<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After five weeks of trial and 56 witnesses, few legal observers believed prosecutors came close to proving Sanford, Fla., neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman committed second-degree murder when he shot and killed Trayvon Martin in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, for many legal analysts, it was no surprise that jurors rejected even a lesser &quot;compromise&quot; verdict of manslaughter, acquitting Zimmerman outright of all criminal charges and deciding he acted in a reasonable way to protect his own life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal was a stinging blow for prosecutors and their decision to file the second-degree murder charge against Zimmerman, who was not initially arrested by Sanford police after claiming self-defence. And it was a resounding embrace of the defence's strategy during closing arguments not just to establish that prosecutors hadn't proven Zimmerman guilty, but also to show he was &quot;absolutely&quot; innocent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The jury clearly believed that you have a right to defend yourself,&quot; said Jude M. Faccidomo, the former president of Miami's Florida Association of Criminal Defence Lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Especially when cases are so grey, like this one was, self-defence really resonates because people can associate with being afraid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while some also have questioned the state attorney's office acceptance of a mostly white jury, a more diverse panel would have returned the same verdict, lawyers who have watched the case believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After seeing the quality of the evidence presented by the state, the diversity of the jury really didn't matter in the end,&quot; said Larry Handfield, a prominent African American Miami criminal defence lawyer. &quot;But it would have helped the community in giving more credibility to the decision to acquit Zimmerman.&quot; By now, the basic outline of the confrontation between the 29-year-old volunteer watch co-ordinator and the 17-year-old Miami Gardens, Fla., student have become familiar through wall-to-wall television coverage and thousands of news stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors said Zimmerman &quot;profiled&quot; Martin, who was returning from a nearby convenience store and was walking through the gated Retreat at Twin Lakes neighbourhood where he was staying with his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman called a non-emergency police number to report Martin as &quot;suspicious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A violent struggle followed on rain-slicked grass and a concrete walkway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the confrontation, Zimmerman shot and killed Martin at point-blank range.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A look at the evidence shows why the jury rejected the state's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For prosecutors intent on proving the more serious charge, proving the &quot;illwill,&quot; &quot;hatred&quot; or &quot;spite&quot; needed to convict on second-degree murder hinged on painting Zimmerman as a frustrated, would-be cop fed up with intruders in his gated Sanford community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To do so, they focused on Zimmerman's past - over defence objections - introducing evidence of his interest in law enforcement, including a ride-along with Sanford police, a class on criminal justice, an unsuccessful application to a Virginia police department. Prosecutors also played five calls to police that Zimmerman made in the several months before the shooting, in an attempt to show a pattern of &quot;profiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also introduced evidence about his membership at a mixed martial arts gym. Their most important evidence to prove &quot;ill-will&quot; was Zimmerman's call to a Sanford police non-emergency dispatcher when he first spotted Martin, saying &quot;these assholes always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there was ever a window into that man's soul, it was that defendant's words on that phone call,&quot; prosecutor John Guy told the jury Friday in a poignant closing argument that appeared to have at least one juror emotionally strained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guy's closing argument was typical of a state's case that drew heavily on emotion and emphasized the youth of the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's prosecution was made tougher under Florida's 2005 Stand Your Ground law, which eliminated a citizen's &quot;duty to retreat&quot; before using lethal force in the face of a deadly threat - an instruction given to jurors on Friday.</SPAN></P>
