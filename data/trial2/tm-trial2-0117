<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One trial for George Zimmerman is over, but another one begins. Found not guilty in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Zimmerman is a free man today. But it's unlikely he will be able to resume a normal life anytime soon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions will dog Zimmerman for the rest of his days, including why he saw fit to tail a black teenager wearing a hoodie on a February 2012 night in Sanford, Fla. A licensed, gun-carrying member of a neighborhood-watch group, Zimmerman had called in a suspicious person's notice to a police dispatcher. Zimmerman was told to back off and wait for officers to arrive. He didn't take the advice and, eventually, there was a fatal confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday night, a jury of six women acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree-murder charges in Martin's death. So far, the verdict in this emotionally charged case has produced little violence -- a tribute to all parties, including Martin's family, for asking the public to remain calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But tensions remain high. No matter the verdict, it's still a tragedy. Nothing will bring back Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old black kid who was walking to his father's house when he encountered Zimmerman, 29, who is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Off the hook in his criminal trial, Zimmerman may now wind up in a federal court. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous has launched a petition calling for the U.S. Justice Department to open a civil-rights case against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this what the country needs -- more divisiveness concerning racial attitudes? Maybe it does, just to find the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are not blaming the Florida jury for this verdict. Based on the insufficient prosecutorial evidence presented in court, the jury was compelled to decide that Zimmerman was acting in self-defense under the state's Stand Your Ground Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, justice leaves a bitter taste. After a two-week trial, we still don't know who was the aggressor leading up to the fatal moment in the confrontation. And while Martin, who was unarmed, had gained the upper hand in the fight, according to a witness, it remains questionable as to whether Zimmerman's life was in extreme danger when he fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Zimmerman doesn't have any regrets about that February night, shame on him. He should. He acted irresponsibly. Even police encountering a threatening situation are urged to call for backup; Zimmerman was told to stand down, and he didn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What fears preyed on Zimmerman to do what he did? Was he purely thinking about public safety, or was there something more ominous in his pursuit of Martin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy doesn't end with the Florida verdict. Zimmerman is a free man, but he will never be free from his conscience and the circumstances surrounding Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
