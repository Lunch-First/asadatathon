<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROTESTS sprung up in cities across America yesterday after George Zimmerman was cleared of criminal charges over the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty of seconddegree murder and manslaughter on Saturday night, following a trial that has sparked debate about guns, race and civil rights in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a 29-year-old neighbourhood watchman, argued that he was acting in self-defence when he shot the black 17-year-old in a gated community in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, demonstrators gathered outside the court house, as well as in New York, Washington DC and San Francisco, with some calling for a civil rights prosecution against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama called for calm on after the acquittal, saying his death was a tragedy and that the country should seek ways to stem gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken,&quot; Obama said in a statement. &quot;I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;  Obama, who last year said that &quot;if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; added that he was aware the Florida case has elicited strong feelings. &quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Department of Justice said last night it would review the case to decided if it should consider prosecuting Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction,&quot; it said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
