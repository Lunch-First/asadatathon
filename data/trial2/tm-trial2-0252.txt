Beyonce called for a moment of silence for Trayvon Martin during a concert just hours after George Zimmerman was found not guilty by a Florida jury. 
The pop star took a moment to honour the teen during her concert on Saturday night at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee.
After asking the crowd to be silent for a moment, she sang the chorus of I Will Always Love You, a song written by country music star Dolly Parton and brought to a global audience by the late Whitney Houston, before transitioning into her hit Halo.
It was just one of several reactions from celebrities and artists following Zimmerman's acquittal earlier Saturday evening. Mr Zimmerman had been charged with second-degree murder after shooting and killing the unarmed 17-year-old in February 2012.
