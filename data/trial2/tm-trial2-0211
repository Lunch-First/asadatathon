<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests were growing in the US last night after the acquittal of a Neighbourhood Watch captain who shot dead an unarmed teenager in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rallies were called across the country after George Zimmerman, 29, was found not guilty of the seconddegree murder of Trayvon Martin, 17, who was killed in February last year after being mistaken for a prowler. Civil rights leaders called the verdict a &quot;slap in the face for the American people&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Martin had been walking through a gated community in Sanford, near Orlando, where his father lived. Mr Zimmerman, who was depicted by the prosecution as a &quot;wannabe cop&quot;, profiled and pursued the black, hoodie-wearing student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His defence lawyers defined him as a well-meaning volunteer who fired a gun to save his own life after Mr Martin rounded on him and beat his head on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman may be free but will be &quot;looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life,&quot; his brother said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legal team for Mr Martin's family described them as heartbroken. &quot;A black 17-year-old child should be able to walk home from a store and not be shot,&quot; said Nataly Jackson, one of the family's lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Jury of six women - five white and one Hispanic - took 16 hours to acquit Mr Zimmerman, accepting the defendant's claim that he acted in Justifiable self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has polarised opinion in America, inflaming those who perceived Mr Zimmerman's actions as racism and raising questions about civil rights and equal Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of the civil rights movement will head to Sanford this week to head rallies. &quot;In my view The American legal system has once again failed Justice,&quot; complained the Rev Jesse Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Sanford at first declined to charge Mr Zimmerman, but were forced to do so after pressure from political, religious and community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the Zimmerman and Martin families appealed for calm yesterday.</SPAN></P>
