<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. (AP) - In an unmistakable setback for George Zimmerman, the jury at the neighborhood watch captain's second-degree murder trial was given the option Thursday of convicting him on the lesser charge of manslaughter in the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Debra Nelson issued her ruling over the objections of Zimmerman's lawyers shortly before a prosecutor delivered a closing argument in which he portrayed the defendant as an aspiring police officer who assumed Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A teenager is dead. He is dead through no fault of his own,&quot; prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told the jurors. &quot;He is dead because a man made assumptions. ... Unfortunately because his assumptions were wrong, Trayvon Benjamin Martin no longer walks this Earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the judge's ruling, the six jurors will have three options when they start deliberations as early as today: guilty of second-degree murder, guilty of manslaughter and not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman attorney Don West had argued an all-or-nothing strategy, saying the only charge that should be put before the jury is second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state has charged him with second-degree murder. They should be required to prove it,&quot; West said. &quot;If they had wanted to charge him with manslaughter ... they could do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
