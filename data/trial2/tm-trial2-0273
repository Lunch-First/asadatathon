<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE CITY'S mayoral candidates quickly weighed in on the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case Saturday night, with many taking to Twitter to denounce George Zimmerman's acquittal in the death of the black Florida teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Bill Thompson, the only African-American in the mayoral race, tweeted that &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was killed because he was black. There was no justice done today in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate, blasted the jury's verdict as &quot;a slap in the face to justice. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death was a terrible tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And City Council Speaker Christine Quinn (D-Manhattan) called the not-guilty verdict &quot;a shocking insult to his family and everyone seeking justice for Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Anthony Weiner sent out this tweet: &quot;Keep Trayvon's family in our prayers. Deeply unsatisfying verdict. Trial by jury is our only choice in a democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controller John Liu, also was critical. &quot;Today's decision is shocking and highlights the sad reality that the day of equal justice for Trayvon and millions of other young men of color has yet to arrive,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there also was a reaction to the reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Councilman Jumaane Williams (D-Brooklyn), who has been at the forefront of the citywide debate over stop-and-frisk policing, sent what might have been one of the more provocative messages on twitter: &quot;I took a nap and I woke up still just a colored, negro, n----- male in America, land of my birth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
