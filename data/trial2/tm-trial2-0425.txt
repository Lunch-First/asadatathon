Re: Fuzzy thinking (email to editor, July 11)
I think letter writer David Lubin misses the point with the prosecution not wanting the fact that Trayvon Martin was smoking weed to be allowed into evidence. It's not a matter of proving whether it mellows a person out or not; rather, it is a matter of presenting a certain image of character. 
The prosecution, with a lot of assistance from the media and even President Obama, has been trying to present Martin as this good, innocent kid who would never do anything wrong. It's the job of the prosecution to paint George Zimmerman as someone looking for trouble and Martin as someone who is just a good kid. Having dope in his system doesn't do that and instead creates a negative picture of Martin to the jury in the same way his girlfriend did with the "cracker" comments and other statements.
Image isn't everything, but it is a lot. Committing one form of illegal activity is not good for Martin's image even if it has no effect on proving who was on top in the brawl, or whether Zimmerman was justified in pulling the trigger or not.

Not to long ago, Trevor Dooley was found guilty after using the stand your ground law right here in Tampa. The final reason, after all the arguments, was that he had brought a gun to the situation. George Zimmerman did, too. He had a permit to carry a gun. Dooley did, too. Dooley, in his 70s, was fighting an ex-Marine in his 40s. Zimmerman, 28 at the time, was into it with a teenager. Dooley got 8 years. If Zimmerman is found not guilty, then bring Trevor Dooley's case back to court. Unless skin color really doesn't matter.
