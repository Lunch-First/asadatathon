We asked our Twitter followers: What do you think of George Zimmerman being acquitted of murder?
It's sad, but people wouldn't be shocked if news media hadn't treated him as if he were already guilty. The jury was free of influence.

George Zimmerman can be best friends with Casey Anthony and O.J. Simpson now. They all have one thing in common.
@JaysonFlores92
Reasonable doubt. Only two people know what really happened, and one of them can't tell his story.

Tragic as Trayvon Martin's death was, I think it would be a travesty if Zimmerman were convicted on fear of public backlash.

When a "justice" system lets a man who stalked and killed a child walk free, it's time to change the system.
@TXBlueChick
Prosecution blew it with second-degree murder charge. A guy guilty of manslaughter got away with killing a fellow human being.

With key facts unknown, such as whose voice was calling for help and who attacked first, not guilty was the only possible outcome.
