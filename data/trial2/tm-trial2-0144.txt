Well, that was fast.
On Saturday, the jury in the George Zimmerman trial found him not guilty in the death of Trayvon Martin. By Monday, one of the six anonymous female jurors announced that she had signed on Martin Literary Managementto shop around a book about the experience. 
"My hope is that people will read Juror B37's book, written with her attorney husband, and understand the commitment it takes to serve and be sequestered on a jury in a highly publicized murder trial and how important, despite one's personal viewpoints, it is to follow the letter of the law," Martin Literary ManagementpresidentSharlene Martin said in a statement." It could open a whole new dialogue about laws that may need to be revised and revamped to suit a 21stcentury way of life.The reader will also learn why the jurors had no option but to find Zimmerman Not Guilty due to the manner in which he was charged and the content of the jury instructions.
The juror, who has so far chosen to remain anonymous, has only been identified as Juror B37. Butthe very public trial means that some information is available about Ms. Juror B37. During the selection process, the juror revealed that she gets all her news from the
 show and only uses newspapers to line parrot cages (among other things).
"It is not known whether they will participate in any media at this time or decide to reveal their identities given the sensitivity of the verdict and the outpouring of mixed reactions by the American public," Ms. Martin said in a statement, about the juror and her attorney husband/co-author.
While the juror may continue to elect to remain anonymous, writing a book about the case is one way to get on the
 show.
