<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American 100-meter record holder Tyson Gay, who has long promoted himself as a clean athlete, tested positive for a banned substance and will pull out of the world championships next month. He could be suspended from competition for at least six months. &quot;I don't have a sabotage story. I don't have any lies. I don't have anything to say to make this seem like it was a mistake,&quot; said Gay, 30, sobbing. &quot;I basically put my trust in someone and I was let down.&quot; He did not reveal the substance or who he was talking about. Also, former 100-meter world-record holder Asafa Powell and Jamaican teammate Sherone Simpson tested positive for the banned stimulant oxilofrine. </SPAN></P>
