OAKLAND -- No one was arrested during a march late Saturday night throughout downtown Oakland, when some in a crowd of about 100 people broke windows, vandalized cars and buildings with spray paint and started fires in the street in protest of George Zimmerman's acquittal hours earlier in a Florida courtroom. 
The atmosphere was tense, with some marchers attempting to start fights and police dressed in riot gear in front of the police department headquarters, according to staff photographer Anda Chu. Footage from television helicopters showed protesters trashing a police squad car and a line of police blocking the protesters' path.
Occupy Oakland organized the gathering over Twitter at 10 p.m., encouraging protesters to wear hoodies, as TrayvonMartin did when he was shot to death by Zimmerman.
Some protesters held a banner declaring: "We Are All TrayvonMartin." Others spray-painted anti-police graffiti throughout Frank Ogawa Plaza, while a small contingent of officers looked on from afar.
The group began to march around 11 p.m. and some began breaking windows, including some on the Oakland Tribune downtown offices.
One BART police car was also vandalized with spray paint and its windows were smashed. Protesters also burned an American and a California state flag at a McDonald's restaurant on 14th and Jackson streets and spray painted Alameda County's Davidson courthouse.
Police said no one was injured.
The Oakland protest followed a San Francisco rally by a couple hundred people who marched peacefully from the Mission and 24th Street BART station to 16th Street and back over a two-hour period while a dozen police vehicles escorted them. After some loud protests, San Francisco organizers ended their march around 10 p.m., asking participants to return Sunday at Powell and Market streets.
