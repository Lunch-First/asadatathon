  Mayoral hopeful Bill de Blasio decried racial profiling yesterday but resisted comparisons being made by others between the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy and the killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin.  
  While his mayoral rivals Anthony Weiner and John Liu drew a direct link between the NYPD's controversial practice and the tactics used by neighborhood-watch volunteer George Zimmerman, de Blasio wouldn't buy that line of logic. 
  "I think they're very different. George Zimmerman was a vigilante," de Blasio said. 
   "It's a very different reality. Clearly, Zimmerman had no authority to do what he did." 
  NYPD critics said Martin's death should fuel their calls for the end of stop-and-frisk. 
   "There are hundreds of thousands of people that have been stopped recently who have done absolutely nothing wrong," Weiner said after a church service in Staten Island.
