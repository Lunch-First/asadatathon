SANFORD: A six-woman jury has found neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering unarmed black teenager TrayvonMartin, in a racially charged trial that transfixed the US. 
``Mr Zimmerman, I have signed the judgment that confirms the jury's verdict. Your bond will be released. Your GPS monitor will be cut off when you exit the courtroom over here. And you have no further business with the court,'' Judge Deborah Nelson said after the decision was read.
Mr Zimmerman smiled briefly but did not appear emotional as the verdict
was read.
His family was grinning broadly as they sat behind him in the courtroom.
Trayvon's family was
not present. The jury had deliberated for more than
16 hours.
Mr Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing
Mr Martin through a gated community in Sanford, Florida and shooting him during an altercation.
Defence lawyers insisted Mr Zimmerman acted in self-defence after Trayvon, 17, wrestled him to the ground and bashed his head into the pavement.
