COMMEMORATION
Beyonce called for a moment of silence for Trayvon Martin during a concert just hours after George Zimmerman was found not guilty.
The pop star took a moment to honour the teen during her concert Saturday night at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tenn. Beyonce sang the chorus of I Will Always Love You before transitioning into her hit, Halo. Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder after shooting and killing the unarmed teen.
