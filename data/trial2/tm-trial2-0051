<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred people rallied in Denver on Sunday to protest the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the Florida man who shot and killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not erase the conversation of race,&quot; said Jeff Fard, founder of Brother Jeff's Cultural Center in Five Points. &quot;Don't be afraid to say if Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a white man, he would be alive today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury Saturday found Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch leader in his Florida community, not guilty of second degree murder or manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman said he shot in self defense after the unarmed Martin, 17, attacked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fard was joined by members of the Greater Metro Denver Ministerial Alliance, local officials and activists during the rally in front of the Martin Luther King memorial in City Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are here to pray, and we are here to stand for justice,&quot; state Rep. Angela Williams, D Denver, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fard collected $1,644 from those in attendance that he said would be given to Martin's family to use for a civil lawsuit or anything else they needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desiree Phillips, 37, who attended the rally with Thomas Johnson, said she began following the case in the days before Zimmerman was arrested. The verdict, she said, made her angry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Zimmerman had &quot;done what the 911 operator asked him to do, (Martin) wouldn't have lost his life,&quot; Johnson, 50, said.</SPAN></P>
