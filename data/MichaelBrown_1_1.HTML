<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE'S A NEW sheriff in this shell-shocked Missouri town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An officer in the state's Highway Patrol who grew up in Ferguson, Mo., and who - like most of the residents - is black, has been tapped to restore order after four straight nights of violence that have shocked the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence,&quot; said Capt. Ron Johnson of the Highway Patrol. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson and a contingent of state troopers took over from the Ferguson Police Department and the St. Louis County Police, who have been widely criticized for their heavy-handed response to protests over the death of a black teen at the hands of a white cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In ordering the switch, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said he was seeking a &quot;different tone&quot; and calm in a town incensed over 18-year-old Michael Brown's killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As night fell Thursday on Ferguson, protesters were allowed to demonstrate peacefully, absent the volatility of Wednesday night's clashes between cops and demonstrators amid clouds of tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think I got their trust and I'll do everything to maintain that trust,&quot; Johnson said Thursday night. And, he vowed to a celebratory crowd: &quot;The gas masks are off. Won't come back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the new openness, Ferguson police plan to release the name Friday of the officer who shot Brown, CNN reported.But Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the county police, defended Wednesday's use of tear gas, stun grenades, rubber bullets, and other hardware they've gotten from the Pentagon to keep protesters in line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In talking to these guys, it is scary,&quot; Schellman said of the officers. &quot;They hear gunshots going off, and they don't know where they're coming from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While acknowledging law enforcement's need to protect the public, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) also said &quot;we need to demilitarize this situation.&quot;Nixon's move came after President Obama said he was &quot;deeply disturbed&quot; by the chaos in the St. Louis suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that emotions are raw in Ferguson,&quot; he said. &quot;But let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama condemned attacks by demonstrators on police trying to maintain order in the tense town. But he added there was &quot;no excuse&quot; for police to use excessive force against demonstrators - or for cops to be &quot;arresting journalists for trying to do their jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President was referring to the arrests of reporters from The Washington Post and Huffington Post who were detained briefly Wednesday by a half-dozen cops who stormed a McDonald's for reasons still unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, who is investigating Brown's death to determine if charges should be brought against the officer who shot him, blasted Nixon for inserting Johnson into the fray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's shameful what he did today, he had no legal authority to do that,&quot; McCulloch told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. &quot;To denigrate the men and women of the county police department is shameful.&quot;In New York, Mayor de Blasio said he was &quot;troubled&quot; by the violence in Ferguson. Noting the lack of disturbances after a Staten Island dad was killed July 17 when a cop used a chokehold, the mayor said New York has the tradition &quot;of respecting and properly managing peaceful protest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not an expert on Missouri, but we have a very different reality here,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor spoke out after the hacker collective Anonymous posted the name of an officer the group blames for Brown's death. The Daily News did not publish it because there has been no official confirmation that it is accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson has steadfastly refused to release the name of the cop - a six-year veteran witnesses have described as white - citing death threats as the reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACLU on Thursday filed a suit demanding the St. Louis County Police release the incident report of Saturday's shooting. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been consoling the Brown family and is planning a rally Sunday in Missouri, called on the Justice Department to monitor the way police are handling the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if we disagree, this climate is not good for anyone and is dangerous for everyone,&quot; Sharpton said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chaos in Ferguson may not be over any time soon. McCulloch has warned it could be weeks before the investigation wraps up and authorities decide whether to charge the cop. The FBI has also launched a civil rights investigation into the killing. And the Brown family has asked for a second autopsy - this one monitored by the Justice Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As night fell, protesters once again began to gather, but there was no repeat of Wednesday's chaos, during which cops in riot gear clashed with hundreds of angry demonstrators, some of them hurling bottles and Molotov cocktails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson has maintained the cop shot Brown after he or Dorian Johnson, a friend he was walking in the street with, went for his gun. He said the officer was hospitalized with facial wounds. But he has also acknowledged there is no video footage of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson claims his pal was &quot;shot like an animal&quot; after the cop told him to get on the sidewalk. Johnson said the cop struggled with Brown and shot him in the back. As Brown tried to say he was unarmed, Johnson said, the officer fired more shots into his head and chest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. - The two women were friends from work. Laura, 27, is white, and Kat, 23, is black, and they came to Ferguson from their jobs at Half and Half in downtown St. Louis on Thursday evening to protest peacefully for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want the name of the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown when he had his hands up in the air released,&quot; says Kat, referring to the Saturday killing of an 18-year-old black man that led to protests, looting and police tear-gassing protesters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then we want him arrested,&quot; says Laura.A magenta sun descended over this normally tranquil community of single-family homes and manicured lawns, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black and the immaculate winding streets are patrolled by a 53-member police force - of which only three officers are black. The loud horns of passing traffic began to blare on Ferguson's main drag, Florissant Ave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of the young white people I know in St. Louis are as outraged as the black community,&quot; says Laura. &quot;The racism here is from the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when people came to protest (Wednesday), the same police force that killed Michael Brown fired tear gas into the crowd,&quot; says Kat. &quot;It looked like a scene from Baghdad. Plus, after they kill Michael Brown, they search all of his social media postings and post only those shots that portray him as some sort of hoodlum. We want justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice has no color,&quot; says Laura.On Florissant, a caravan of horn-honking cars proceeded up to Greater St. Mark's Baptist Church for a rally, and a stream of protesters held their hands up the way they said Michael Brown did on the day he was shot. As they passed the boarded-up fast food joints and auto parts stores, they chanted &quot;No justice! No peace!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing on the sidewalk near Nesbit Drive, Joetta Umana watched with her neighbor Jewel Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have lived in Ferguson for 21 years,&quot; says Umana. &quot;I have never seen anything like . . . Wednesday night, when police fired the tear gas. They told us to go indoors. One said to me, 'Why do you want to be out anyway?' I told him because I live here and Michael Brown lived a block away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only time I ever saw anything like this was when I was a schoolgirl in Alabama, when Rev. Martin Luther King was marching,&quot; she says. &quot;They attacked his marches with fire hoses and dogs and tear gas, too. But that was 1965 in Alabama. This is 2014 in St. Louis. It's outrageous. They made us prisoners in our own homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That tear gas really stung the eyes and made you choke really bad,&quot; says Umana.&quot;I'm against the violent ones, the looters,&quot; says Washington. &quot;I bring my car to the auto mechanic whose window they broke. I shop at the Quik Stop. But that was Monday and Tuesday. (Wednesday) night they were peaceful, and then they used the tear gas. It was terrible. I had my 30-year-old grandson at my house, I wouldn't let him go outside. You can lose a son or a grandson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2014, with the first black President two years into his second term, suddenly Ferguson, Mo., becomes the new Selma. Umana and Washington agree Obama could never have won without tens of millions of whites voting for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's true,&quot; says Umana. &quot;But it only takes a few, a handful, to ignite the racism again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I lived here 21 years, too, and I never knew that Ferguson only has three black officers,&quot; says Washington. &quot;Now that just isn't right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By night's end, Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson had taken over Ferguson security, ordered cops to bag the gas masks, and then marched with the protesters. Authorities also said they would release the name of the cop who killed Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This helped ease tensions. But it didn't end them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Nesbit Drive, Kat and Laura walked toward their car to go to another rally in Smith Square in downtown St. Louis. There, young people, black and white, many from George Washington University, would be signing a petition asking for justice in the Michael Brown case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not about black and white,&quot; says Kat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about police abusing their power,&quot; Laura says as the women head downtown, with night falling like a shiver across Ferguson.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THOUSANDS OF New Yorkers took to the streets Thursday night to show solidarity with protesters in the St. Louis suburb rocked by the police shooting of an unarmed black teen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators gathered in Harlem; Union Square; Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn; and Jamaica, Queens, for a moment of silence at 7 p.m. in support of protesters 1,000 miles away in Ferguson, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a parent and grandparent - I could not imagine if that was my child or grandchild,&quot; Toni Arenstein, 64, of Chelsea said in Union Square, of Michael Brown, 18, who was shot to death Saturday by a white cop in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international hacker collective Anonymous sent out a call on the Internet for a &quot;day of rage&quot; to coincide with a National Moment of Silence across the nation Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 rallies were held throughout the country, including protests in Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests came a day after police in riot gear fired tear gas and stun grenades to break up a protest in Ferguson, where some people hurled bottles and Molotov cocktails at officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After congregating in Union Square, protesters began marching uptown, collecting supporters along the way. By the time they reached Times Square, demonstrators numbered in the low thousands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops put up barricades on Seventh Ave. and formed a line to stop the crowd from marching north on Broadway. At least five people were taken into custody, a police source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 200 protesters gathered in Morningside Park in Harlem, where they lit candles to remember victims of police brutality. Among those at the demonstration was Denisha Jingles of Ferguson, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is my home. Seeing what our men go through daily, it's not fair,&quot; Jingles said.About 300 protesters formed a peaceful circle in Fulton Park in Bedford-Stuyvesant, as cops stood at a distance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly 100 people also gathered in Baisley Pond Park in Jamaica. Some held signs reading, &quot;Fists up, guns down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. - The two women were friends from work. Laura, 27, is white, and Kat, 23, is black, and they came to Ferguson from their jobs at Half and Half in downtown St. Louis on Thursday evening to protest peacefully for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want the name of the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown when he had his hands up in the air released,&quot; says Kat, referring to the Saturday killing of an 18-year-old black man that has led to protests, looting and police tear-gassing protesters on Wednesday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then we want him arrested,&quot; says Laura, holding a sign reading &quot;Justice for Michael Brown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a magenta sun descended over this normally tranquil community of single-family homes, manicured lawns and immaculate winding streets that is two-thirds black and patrolled by a 53-member police force of which only three officers are black, the loud horns of passing traffic began to blare on Ferguson's main drag, Florissant Ave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of the young white people I know in St. Louis are as outraged as the black community,&quot; says Laura. &quot;The racism here is from the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when people came to protest last night, the same police force that killed Michael Brown fired tear gas into the crowd,&quot; says Kat. &quot;It looked like a scene from Baghdad. Plus after they kill Michael Brown, they search all of his social media postings and post only those shots that portray him as some sort of hoodlum. We want justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice has no color,&quot; says Laura. &quot;That's why blacks and whites in St. Louis are demanding justice for Michael Brown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Florissant, a caravan of horn-honking cars proceeded up to Greater St. Mark's Baptist Church for a rally, and a stream of protesters held their hands up the way they said Michael Brown did on the day he was shot. As they passed the boarded-up fast food joints and auto parts stores, they chanted &quot;No justice! No peace!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing on the sidewalk near Nesbit Drive, Joetta Umana watched with her neighbor Jewel Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have lived in Ferguson for 21 years,&quot; says Umana. I have never seen anything like . . . Wednesday night, when police fired the tear gas. They told us to go indoors. One said to me, 'Why do you want to be out anyway?' I told him because I live here and Michael Brown lived a block away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only time I ever saw anything like this was when I was a schoolgirl in Alabama, when Rev. Martin Luther King was marching,&quot; she says. &quot;They attacked his marches with fire hoses and dogs and tear gas, too. But that was 1965 in Alabama. This is 2014 in St. Louis. It's outrageous. They made us prisoners in our own homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That tear gas really stung the eyes and made you choke really bad,&quot; says Umana. &quot;You can't go out on a summer night to watch people protest peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm against the violent ones, the looters,&quot; says Washington. &quot;I bring my car to the auto mechanic whose window they broke. I shop at the Quik Stop. But that was Monday and Tuesday. (Wednesday) night they were peaceful, and then they used the tear gas. It was terrible. I had my 30-year-old grandson at my house, I wouldn't let him go outside. You can lose a son or a grandson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2014, with the first black President two years into his second term, suddenly Ferguson, Mo., becomes the new Selma. Umana and Washington agree Obama could never have won without tens of millions of whites voting for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's true,&quot; says Umana. &quot;But it only takes a few, a handful, to ignite the racism again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I lived here 21 years, too, and I never knew that Ferguson only has three black officers,&quot; says Washington. &quot;Now that just isn't right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Nesbit Drive, Kat and Laura walked toward their car to go to another rally in Smith Square in downtown St. Louis. There, young people, black and white, many from George Washington University, would be signing a petition asking for justice in the Michael Brown case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not about black and white,&quot; says Kat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about police abusing their power,&quot; says Laura. As they head downtown with night falling like a shiver across Ferguson.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At last, the adults have arrived in Ferguson, Mo., six days after a huge, paramilitary police presence further inflamed residents hurting after the deadly shooting of an unarmed young man by a police officer yet to be identified. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bringing in the big guns, quite literally, after that, and pointing them at residents and reporters, was unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet it took six days for Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon to take command from the local police departments that have made the inner-ring St. Louis suburb look and feel like a war zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that long for President Obama to pull himself away from his vacation and say that the FBI and Department of Justice were looking into Brown's killing, and to ask for calm and restraint on all sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, a handful of protesters have behaved badly, with looting on one night and a very few throwing flaming bottles at the police. Inexcusable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, no officer has been badly hurt and the response - resembling something out of a bad action movie, and including a clampdown on peaceful protest - has been wholly out of proportion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops have pointed sniper rifles at citizens with their hands up, as witnesses said 18-year-old Michael Brown's were when he was gunned down. No. That is the surest way to inflame a crowd, not calm it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have arrested reporters trying to report the news - on charges of &quot;loitering&quot; at a McDonald's. Fired tear gas and rubber bullets with little evident provocation and in residential neighborhoods. Used loudspeakers to order people to stop filming these acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, no, no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those convinced of the perfidy of police officers have seized on it all to cry out that cops writ large are racist and running amok.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrong. New York City police, the numbers tell us, have grown increasingly restrained in firing their weapons or otherwise using deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The terrible tragedy of Eric Garner's death doesn't change that fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also really ought to compare the Missouri mess to the official response to Garner's killing, in which the officer was quickly named and suspended and now will have the due process he is entitled to, and where citizens exercising their rights to protest have been treated with the respect they deserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton this week, speaking about police shootings: &quot;They will never go away; that's the nature of our lives, unfortunately. The idea is how you prevent them from happening and how you deal with them when do occur.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a lesson in how not to deal with them, look no further than Ferguson.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE'S A NEW sheriff in this shell-shocked Missouri town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An officer in the state's Highway Patrol who grew up in Ferguson, Mo., and who - like most of the residents - is black, has been tapped to restore order after four straight nights of violence that have shocked the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence,&quot; Capt. Ron Johnson of the Highway Patrol said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson and a contingent of state troopers took over from the Ferguson Police Department and the St. Louis County Police, who have been widely criticized for their heavy-handed response to protests over the death of a black teenager at the hands of a white cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In ordering the switch, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said he was seeking a &quot;different tone&quot; and calm in a town incensed over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the county police, defended using tear gas, stun grenades, rubber bullets and other hardware they have gotten from the Pentagon to keep protesters in line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In talking to these guys, it is scary,&quot; Schellman said of the officers. &quot;They hear gunshots going off, and they don't know where they're coming from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said &quot;we need to de-militarize this situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution,&quot; she said in a statement. &quot;I obviously respect law enforcement's work to provide public safety, but my constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests, and police need to respect that right and protect that right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon's move came after President Obama said he was &quot;deeply disturbed&quot; by the chaos in the St. Louis suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that emotions are raw in Ferguson,&quot; he said. &quot;But let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama condemned attacks by demonstrators on police trying to maintain order in the tense town. But he added there was &quot;no excuse&quot; for police to use excessive force against demonstrators - or for cops to be &quot;arresting journalists for trying to do their jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President was referring to the arrests of reporters from The Washington Post and Huffington Post who were detained briefly Wednesday by a half-dozen cops who stormed a McDonald's for reasons still unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York, Mayor de Blasio said he was &quot;troubled&quot; by the violence in Ferguson. Noting the lack of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disturbances after a Staten Island dad was killed July 17 when a cop used a chokehold, the mayor said New York has the tradition &quot;of respecting and properly managing peaceful protest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not an expert on Missouri, but we have a very different reality here,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor spoke out after the hacker collective Anonymous posted the name of an officer the group blames for Brown's death. The Daily News has not published it because there has been no official confirmation that it's accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson has steadfastly refused to release the name of the cop - a six-year veteran witnesses have described as white - citing death threats as the reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson's decision, however, has incensed Ferguson residents who charge the officer is benefiting from a double standard. They suspect the chief is protecting a &quot;bad cop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACLU on Thursday filed a suit demanding that the St. Louis County Police release the incident report of Saturday's shooting. That report would contain the officer's name and other details of the tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been consoling the Brown family and is planning a rally Sunday in Missouri, called on the Justice Department to monitor the way police are handling the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if we disagree, this climate is not good for anyone and is dangerous for everyone,&quot; Sharpton said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chaos in Ferguson may not be over any time soon. St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch has warned it could be several weeks before the investigation wraps up and authorities decide whether to charge the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI has also launched a civil rights investigation into the killing. And the Brown family has asked for a second autopsy - this one monitored by the Justice Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson continued to be a war zone Thursday. As night fell, protesters once again began to gather. It remained to be seen whether there would be a repeat of Wednesday's chaos, during which cops in riot gear clashed with hundreds of angry demonstrators, some of them hurling bottles and Molotov cocktails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson has maintained the cop shot Brown after he or Dorian Johnson, a friend he was walking in the street with, went for his gun. He said the officer was hospitalized with facial wounds. But he has also acknowledged there is no video footage of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson claims his pal was &quot;shot like an animal&quot; after the cop told him to get on the sidewalk. Johnson said the cop struggled with Brown and shot him in the back. As Brown tried to say he was unarmed, Johnson said, the officer fired more shots into his head and chest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Soboroff said he expected the LAPD to prioritize its inquiry and conduct a thorough investigation of Monday evening's shooting of Ezell Ford, 25.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford's death prompted a backlash on social media against the LAPD, with some comparing it to the shooting of Michael Brown, a young, unarmed black man in Ferguson, Mo., which has led to ongoing protests and national headlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important to find out the facts and distinguish the two cases,&quot; Soboroff told The Times. &quot;Our Police Department is not their Police Department.... Because there is a tendency to compare apples to oranges, it's important for us to gather the facts of what happened as quickly as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soboroff was joined by civil rights advocate Earl Ofari Hutchinson, who said he was meeting Thursday evening with LAPD officials at the department's Newton Division and would call for a &quot;fast-track,&quot; transparent investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hutchinson, president of the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, said he would urge the LAPD to talk to all potential witnesses. Some local residents who said they saw at least portions of the incident have provided accounts that conflict with the department's version, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got a 'he said, she said,' &quot; Hutchinson said. &quot;That's why it's important -- because you have these two conflicting versions of what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the meeting, Hutchinson released a statement saying that LAPD officials had pledged that the department's investigation would be transparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the union representing rank-and-file LAPD officers called for patience during the department's investigation, criticizing what he called &quot;inaccurate reports&quot; about the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While waiting for the facts to be determined, I feel the need to restate the obvious,&quot; Tyler Izen said. &quot;When a person attempts to take an officer's gun from them, no matter their physical or mental condition, we should expect an officer to respond accordingly to save their life -- and that likely includes the use of deadly force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the department fast-tracks the investigation, it still could take months before investigators come up with their determination of what occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LAPD late Thursday issued a statement asking any witnesses to contact the department or the office of inspector general, saying that &quot;information from the public regarding this incident has been limited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting took place as Ford was walking home along 65th Street in the Florence area of the city, according to witnesses and police. LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said two veteran gang officers were driving on the same street when they spotted Ford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An LAPD statement, citing a preliminary investigation, said officers got out of their car and tried to talk to Ford, but he &quot;continued walking and made suspicious movements, including attempting to conceal his hands.&quot; When the officers got closer, Smith said, Ford &quot;whirled around and basically tackled the lead officer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford reached for the officer's gun, Smith said, prompting his partner to open fire. The officer on the ground reached for his backup weapon and also fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite requests by The Times, the LAPD has yet to identify the officers or explain why they initially wanted to talk to Ford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A friend of Ford's family told The Times that she witnessed part of the incident and saw no struggle between the officers and Ford. Dorene Henderson said Ford was shot despite local residents warning police that he was mentally ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several dozen people rallied Thursday evening in South L.A. to call for justice for Ford. A larger rally is planned for Sunday outside LAPD's downtown headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford's family has said he had been diagnosed with depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. An attorney representing the family, Steven A. Lerman, said he planned to file a wrongful-death lawsuit against the LAPD.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FERGUSON, MO.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several nights of tense street confrontations, state and federal authorities stepped in Thursday to curb the aggressive tactics of local police against demonstrators protesting the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon dispatched the State Highway Patrol to take over security in Ferguson, promising &quot;a softer front&quot; to law enforcement after images of police wielding automatic weapons, flash grenades and tear gas drew stunned reactions from across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,&quot; Nixon said at a news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black and grew up in this predominantly black suburb of St. Louis, was tapped to lead the effort. &quot;It means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the day, Johnson joined demonstrators near the scene of previous confrontations stemming from the fatal weekend shooting and exchanged hugs and handshakes with protesters as they passed. Officers stood by with casual demeanors, without visible body armor or rifles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man told Johnson that his niece had been hit with tear gas during the demonstrations. &quot;What would you say to her?&quot; the man asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tell her Capt. Johnson is sorry and he apologizes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama weighed in from his vacation in Martha's Vineyard, Mass., saying that he had asked U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. to investigate the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who several witnesses said had his hands up when he was killed. The president was also critical of the arrest of two journalists covering the unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances,&quot; the president said. &quot;He was 18 years old, and his family will never hold Michael in their arms again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama issued a stern admonition to both police and looters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their 1st Amendment rights,&quot; he said. &quot;Police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder said federal agents would help authorities &quot;conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racial dynamic of the city has long been a volatile mix: Two-thirds of residents are black, and police and city officials are predominantly white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When demonstrations began after the shooting Saturday, the feeling that police viewed residents as enemy combatants inflamed anger on the streets, as did officials' refusal to release the name of the officer who shot Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large protests over the last several days have been mostly peaceful during daylight hours. But after vandals looted 12 businesses Sunday night, officers in military vehicles and riot gear swarmed into neighborhoods ordering demonstrators and residents to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers fired stun grenades, tear gas canisters, bean bags and rubber bullets on those who refused. A small minority of the crowds lobbed bottles, rocks and Molotov cocktails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar clashes repeated over the next three nights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) had urged the Justice Department to take a stronger role in ending the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to demilitarize the situation,&quot; she said. &quot;This kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution.... My constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a church in Florissant, a town neighboring Ferguson, residents expressed their outrage over Brown's killing. They said they also were concerned about the aggressive police presence in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are scared to death to come outside,&quot; said Sierra Smith, 27, who lives near where Brown was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She described how police had blocked the streets around her apartment complex at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A neighbor with a 3-week-old baby was blocked by police from going out for formula and diapers when she ran out, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tremaine Combs, 32, said he took his son on an errand to Walgreens when his son spotted a police officer driving by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was so terrified that he started crying, and he's only 5 years old,&quot; Combs said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of demonstrators took to the sidewalks and median in front of the burned-out husk of a QuikTrip gas station and convenience store on West Florissant Avenue, holding signs calling for justice for Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far, no police is around; that's the way I like it,&quot; said Dion Dupree, 21, who lives nearby. &quot;I haven't been to work all this week. Leave us alone, and let us get our justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tishawn Stroud, 30, said the police's tactics had created an ugly cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the public sees things like that, they feel like they're in a war zone,&quot; Stroud said. &quot;Then they begin acting like they're in a war zone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clark McPhail, one of the top experts on controlling public gatherings and an emeritus professor at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said police appeared to have made serious errors in handling the scene in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were geared up as though they were going into combat,&quot; he said. &quot;I am always stunned when I see police agencies behave that way in the 21st century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plumes of tear gas have appeared nearly every night, enforcing the picture of suburban Ferguson as a battleground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riot control experts say the use of tear gas can not only quell unrest, but can incite it if not used properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993, after a two-month standoff, federal agents fired tear gas into a compound occupied by the Branch Davidians near Waco, Texas, triggering years of investigation into the subsequent conflagration that took 76 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seattle police in 1999 fired so much tear gas into crowds of thousands who were protesting a World Trade Organization meeting that they ran short of canisters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Wertheimer, a crowd control expert who runs the consulting firm Crowd Management Strategies, said chemical irritants can be controversial but were sometimes needed. &quot;It's not the worst thing you can do to people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson, of the Highway Patrol, did not say whether his officers would use tear gas. But other officials in the agency said tactical vehicles and SWAT teams would not be on the front lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As officers and federal agents planned for Thursday night's deployment, FBI and Justice Department investigators from St. Louis and Washington spoke with people who witnessed the Brown shooting, Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Justice Department was pushing ahead with a federal investigation in the case, saying it would be &quot;thorough and fair,&quot; but cautioning that the review would &quot;take time to conduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACLU of Missouri filed a lawsuit seeking to obtain copies of initial police reports on the shooting after its open records request for the incident report was rejected by police Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a Democratic congressman said he was planning to introduce a bill to restrict a Defense Department program that provides machine guns and other surplus military equipment for free to law enforcement agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) wrote to colleagues that city streets should be a place for businesses and families, &quot;not tanks and M-16s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our local police are quickly beginning to resemble paramilitary forces,&quot; Johnson wrote.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and there's no question he's running -- Rand Paul has firmly established himself as the most intriguing Republican eyeing the White House in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday brought fresh evidence as the Kentucky senator leaped headlong into the racial caldron that is Ferguson, Mo., with a bluntly stated Time magazine essay on the police shooting of Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weighing in was hardly a surprise; there are flies circling honey pots with more restraint than a politician given a chance to hold forth on the issue of the day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, what was striking was the angry tone and underlying sympathies of Paul's essay, a condemnation of the &quot;rising militarization of law enforcement&quot; in the country and assertion that equal justice under law is more of a pleasing bromide than reality on the streets of 2014 America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention,&quot; Paul wrote. &quot;Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for nonviolent mistakes in their youth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul's rhetoric is not just a break with others in the embryonic Republican presidential field; it challenges GOP political orthodoxy going back several decades, ever since Richard Nixon made law and order a cudgel to batter Democrats in the riot-torn 1968 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy may have reached its apogee -- or nadir -- 20 years later, when George H.W. Bush won the White House in part due to fears summoned by the lurid visage of black convict Willie Horton, used as a symbol of Michael Dukakis' woolly headed liberalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of which makes Paul, in a phrase that grew fashionable when Bill Clinton challenged the verities of his Democratic Party, a very different kind of Republican -- one seemingly eager to shatter preconceived notions of him and his party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking the side of protesters against alleged police brutality -- however implicitly -- is a startling way to position oneself in a Republican primary. But it is wholly consistent with what has been an unorthodox Paul strategy from the start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has made it plain that his appeal is not to the barnacled Old Guard of the party but a younger, presumably hipper and more broad-minded constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to be like the rest of America,&quot; Paul memorably counseled fellow Republicans at a New Hampshire campaign appearance last year. &quot;We're going to win when we look like America. We need to be white, we need to be brown, we need to be black, we need to be with tattoos, without tattoos, with ponytails, without ponytails, with beards, without.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues that Paul has pursued, foremost among them personal protections against a vast, overweening federal government, are resonant with the libertarian devotees of his father, former Republican Rep. Ron Paul, a thrice-failed candidate for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he also has sought to broaden his appeal, and that of the Republican Party, among skeptical black voters by taking on issues like prison sentencing reform, noting the disproportionate impact the so-called war on drugs has had on young African American men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is more, Paul has ventured -- with decidedly mixed results -- before black audiences and other places where Republicans are scarcely seen. (Though some of the drama can be overstated; for all the talk of Paul's brave appearance earlier this year at UC Berkeley, the fact is there are plenty of libertarians and even conservatives to be found in the San Francisco Bay Area, and many of those who attended were supporters of the Kentucky lawmaker.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul's illuminating Time essay was an exercise in political finesse, wrapping his condemnation of police tactics around an argument against government overreach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a systemic problem with today's law enforcement,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies -- where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is not an easy case to make -- appealing to both the sensitivities of black voters and the unhappiness of big-government foes -- and Paul has hardly proved to be the most supple of politicians. He did not help himself by being caught this month on camera fleeing a conversation in Iowa with immigration reform advocates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But attention is the oxygen that breathes life into a presidential campaign, especially at this preliminary stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By staking controversial, atypical positions like those outlined in Thursday's essay, Paul ensures that people will continue to pay his candidacy notice, even if he ultimately falls short of winning the GOP nomination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">When the police kill; <BR>Deadly shootings in Ferguson, Mo., and L.A. may be different, but they are bound by a common thread.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAIN NEWS; Editorial Desk; Part A; Pg. 18</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">427 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There may be a world of difference between the shooting Saturday of an unarmed man by police in Ferguson, Mo., and the LAPD shooting Monday of an unarmed and apparently mentally ill man in South Los Angeles -- or there may not be -- but the incidents are bound by a common thread that runs through American history and that demands continuing attention and corrective action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly public safety requires police forces of well-trained officers ready to put their lives on the line for the people they serve. It also requires that the people who pay for and rightfully expect to be protected by the police have well-founded confidence in them, and that confidence requires in turn that the public has an opportunity to discover and challenge bad or outmoded police policies, practices and attitudes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than a week has passed since the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, and even less time since the killing of 26-year-old Ezell Ford here, so it is simply not yet possible to say with certainty whether police in each case followed their training and policy. But a basic fact of life in Ferguson is undeniable: An overwhelmingly white police force disproportionately stops and arrests African Americans. It is a situation that resonates in other cities across the nation, where occupation-style policing in nonwhite neighborhoods once prevailed and may prevail still. People must have reason to believe that police will hear and heed their legitimate complaints, and if there appears to be no safe and rational forum for that conversation, they will seek another one, as the violent encounters in Ferguson over the last five nights show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Los Angeles is high on the list of cities with long histories of police abuses, especially in African American neighborhoods. Those include a number of deadly encounters between officers and mentally disturbed people that could have been avoided, so the Ford shooting is necessarily seen and felt in that context. But Los Angeles also has a history, albeit a much shorter one, of police reform and community engagement, so there may exist sufficient residual confidence that Ford's tragic death will be properly investigated and any necessary corrective action taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's still not enough, though. Even if it turns out that policy and procedure were scrupulously followed in the Ford shooting, it is hard to believe that police cannot refine their encounters with unarmed citizens to avoid the use of deadly force -- and to avoid reopening wounds that have barely begun to heal here and remain raw elsewhere.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">616 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes, you have to ask yourself a question: Do you want to speak up against injustice or will you remain silent, becoming complicit through complacency?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the question facing Canadians, as we sit here watching Ferguson, Miss., burn, while doing nothing. Our government is often quick to condemn far-off nations for acts of aggression against their own people, but when such oppression is perpetrated by our border buddies, our government is noticeable only by its absence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those unaware of the goings-on in Ferguson (and considering the paucity of coverage by Canada's traditional media of the Ferguson protests, ignorance would be understandable, though lamentable), a police officer killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black youth, in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. This occurred on Sunday. Some witness reports describe a murder, though the police say the lethal action was justified. In a clear display of disregard for human dignity, the police left Brown's body lying in the middle of the street for hours while officers did everything but investigate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson's population is 70 per cent black, and black residents are disproportionately subjected to traffic stops, searches and arrests. Brown's killing was not some aberration from an otherwise colour-blind police force; it was the natural escalation, given police have shown such clear disdain for the citizenry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the days since, protests have rolled through some of Ferguson's streets. Throughout these protests, the police have consistently escalated matters - coaxing, taunting residents into resistance. They are firing tear gas into backyards; they are shooting rubber and wooden bullets into crowds; they are tormenting media there to document this most recent struggle for civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as a nation, we are silent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a role for Canadian citizens to play. Though we can't all hop onto planes and fly to Ferguson (especially since the police have instituted a no-fly zone), we can still exert some pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can march on Parliament Hill or the United States Embassy. We can urge Prime Minister Stephen Harper and John Baird, the minister of foreign affairs and a local MP, to step in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can contact the NDP foreign affairs critic Paul Dewar, another local MP, and demand that he speak out against the past week's oppression of civil liberties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must also recognize the destructive circumstances that contributed to this continuing tragedy, ensuring that we don't replicate Missouri's errors, even if on a smaller scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial strife and the targeting of black residents by the Ferguson police are significant factors in this situation. As Canadians, we may wish to think that we are much further along in achieving a post-racial society than our brothers and sisters to the south, but we are likely fooling ourselves. The thousands of missing or murdered indigenous women, crimes that have not been solved, are testament to that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, we can resist the continued militarization of our police forces. Looking at the pictures coming out of Ferguson, you might be surprised to learn that the military presence is actually the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outfitted with combat gear, assault rifles and tanks - yes, tanks - the police are kitted up for war, not to protect and serve. It is a joke that we consider these men peace officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But before we worry too much about ourselves, we must help to free the residents of Ferguson from the police occupation. Over the last decade, we have involved ourselves in foreign entanglements in such places as Afghanistan and Libya, commending ourselves for helping the oppressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, our neighbours need our help, and the least we can do is speak up.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOMENTS AFTER an unarmed black teenager was killed by a suburban St. Louis cop, a county police dispatcher reported an urgent request from an officer in trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Need assistance with crowd control,&quot; the dispatcher said on recordings of radio chatter from Saturday - the day 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A short time time later, the dispatcher reported an &quot;officer-involved shooting&quot; in Ferguson, Mo., but added, &quot;Be advised. This information came from the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We called Ferguson back again and they don't know anything about it,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty minutes later, it was all hands on deck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attention, all cars. Be advised we are switching over to the riot channel,&quot; the dispatcher said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apparent confusion was revealed in recordings obtained and posted on the Web Wednesday by Anonymous, a hacker collective that has launched &quot;Operation Ferguson&quot; to make sure that Brown's death is investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also trying to unmask the officer who fired the fatal shots. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson has refused to identify the cop because of threats against his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tapes were unveiled on the same day that Brown's pal Dorian Johnson, who claims the teen was &quot;shot like an animal,&quot; finally met with police and FBI investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His lawyer, former St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley, said he tried to arrange a meeting with police after the killing but was rebuffed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St. Louis County police, insisted they tried several times to talk to Johnson but could not find him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brown killing has stoked racial tensions in a mostly African-American suburb where there is deep resentment against a 53-person police force that has just three black officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite repeated calls for calm from people including President Obama, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Brown's family, Ferguson has been rocked by three straight nights of disturbances and looting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests racked this St. Louis suburb for a fifth straight night Wednesday as anger flared anew over the police killing of an unarmed young black man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armored personnel carriers and officers wearing body armor and carrying assault rifles greeted demonstrators. When the crowd ignored orders to disperse, officers unleashed tear gas and rubber bullets, witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sealed off the area that was the scene of vandalism and looting Sunday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've done everything we can to demonstrate a remarkable amount of restraint,&quot; St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said in an interview outside the command post. &quot;If there was an easy way to fix this, we would have already solved the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers had heard sporadic gunfire, he said. At least 10 people were arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of them was St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, a friend of his, Liz Peinado, said in a Twitter post. During the unrest, French has posted videos on social media of protests and the police presence on the streets. His arrest could not be independently confirmed late Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Jay Nixon tweeted that he was canceling planned appearances to visit the area Thursday. President Obama was briefed on the situation, a White House spokesman tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the nighttime confrontation, protesters with shirts wrapped around their faces held signs that read, &quot;Hands up, don't shoot,&quot; as police closed in on the crowd. The slogan has been adopted by protesters because witnesses said 18-year-old Michael Brown was running with his hands in the air when a policeman shot him to death Saturday in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In live amateur video posted to social media, police could be overheard telling the group to get out of the area or they would be arrested. Clouds of tear gas were visible in the background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest unrest came hours after St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said details about the Brown shooting would not be released any time soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are still in the information-gathering part of the investigation,&quot; McCulloch said in a televised news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged anyone with information to come forward and promised that every piece of evidence would be reviewed, presented to a grand jury and eventually made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By withholding details from the public during the criminal inquiry, investigators would be better able to gauge witnesses' credibility, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the St. Louis County Police Department, the FBI and civil rights attorneys from the Justice Department are conducting parallel investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial tension has simmered since Saturday's shooting, beginning with a protest late that day. Then, on Sunday night, vandals rampaged through 12 businesses, burning one and breaking windows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson is a working-class suburb of 21,000, where two-thirds of residents are black but police and city officials are predominantly white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the largest protests have been peaceful, demonstrations have turned ugly at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mostly, the protests have been bloodless. But about 1 a.m. Wednesday, St. Louis County police said, an officer shot and critically wounded a man who had pointed a handgun at the officer near the site of the Brown shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Wednesday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said he would not identify the officer involved in the Brown shooting because a rumor had misidentified the officer and prompted death threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer who shot Brown was injured in the confrontation and the &quot;side of his face was swollen,&quot; Jackson said. The officer was treated at a hospital, the chief said, and he was &quot;very shaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said the department has asked protesters to rally only during daylight hours to ensure community safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local law enforcement authorities released only a few details about the shooting, and several witnesses have disputed the police account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown had been walking down a street with a friend Saturday about noon when, according to police, an officer drove up and attempted to get out of his patrol car, and Brown pushed the officer back into the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an altercation over a weapon in the car, the officer and Brown got out of the vehicle, and the fatal shooting occurred, according to Belmar, the St. Louis County police chief. Bystanders said Brown had raised his hands to surrender when the fatal shots occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday evening, a brief contretemps occurred when two journalists were taken into custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reporters -- one from the Washington Post, the other from the Huffington Post -- were quickly released after the intervention of Jackson, Ferguson's police chief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Sharpton has seen the same tragic tale so many times over the decades he could recite the entire sequence from memory:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It always begins with an unarmed black or Hispanic male killed by cops during an arrest for some minor infraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is why Sharpton on Tuesday was in Ferguson, Mo., the St. Louis suburb rocked by angry protests and minor looting last weekend after local cops shot to death an 18-year-old black man they had stopped for walking in the street. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dead teen, Michael Brown, was scheduled to start college this week. The unarmed Brown assaulted an officer, cops say, a version several witnesses dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no video here, like there was when Eric Garner died July 17 on Staten Island. That footage captured Garner being asphyxiated from an illegal chokehold by one of several cops arresting him for peddling loose cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton went to Missouri at the request of Brown's parents, to give national voice to the rage of Ferguson's black community. Left unsaid was how his presence could also channel that rage into peaceful cries for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His trip came only days after he changed plans for a big Aug. 23 civil rights march over the Verrazano Bridge to demand that the cop who fatally choked Garner, Officer Daniel Pantaleo, be indicted for homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After vowing to lead thousands in a marathon walk over the Verrazano, Sharpton switched instead to a bus and car caravan, with a much shorter march to the site of Garner's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some news reports claim the reverend caved to pressure from Gov. Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio. But several sources in the coalition of civil rights and labor groups co-sponsoring the march say it was the unions, especially 1199 SEIU, that persuaded Sharpton to modify his plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would have been a logistical nightmare to walk over that bridge,&quot; one union leader said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton realized the controversy was becoming a diversion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people were trying to make the issue whether we walked or rode across the bridge,&quot; Sharpton told me, &quot;instead of focusing on Eric Garner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kind of senseless police crackdown on blacks and Hispanics that ended in Garner's death is what de Blasio vowed to end as a mayoral candidate. To his credit, the mayor has reformed stop-and-frisk policies and welcomed stronger oversight of policing practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his police commissioner, Bill Bratton, still clings to a policy of constant arrests in minority communities for quality-of-life crimes. During Bratton's first six months, the NYPD arrested 117,336 people for misdemeanors, nearly 90% of them black and Latino, according to a study the nonprofit Police Reform Organizing Project released this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's up slightly from the 117,104 misdemeanor arrests in the same period last year under then-Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even for misdemeanor marijuana possession, nearly 90% of those arrested are black and Hispanic. Who in their right mind believes white youth don't smoke marijuana?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They seem to believe a kid in the South Bronx who smokes marijuana will grow up to be a criminal, but a kid who does it in SoHo or Columbia University, it's just recreational use,&quot; Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stop-and-frisk may have been &quot;reformed,&quot; but racial profiling persists. That is why Sharpton will march on Staten Island on Aug. 23. And why the family of Michael Brown is now expected to come from Missouri to join the protest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAME the cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the message the Rev. Al Sharpton delivered Tuesday in St. Louis, where he spoke three days after a police officer fatally shot unarmed black teen Michael Brown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The local authorities have put themselves in a position - hiding names and not being transparent - where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation,&quot; Sharpton said, joined by Brown's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton also echoed pleas for peaceful protests by the NAACP and the 18-year-old Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., who told the crowd: &quot;I need all of us to come together and do this right. . . . No violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama said people must comfort each other &quot;in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ferguson, Mo., police chief opted Tuesday not to release the officer's name after the department was deluged with death threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we come out and say, 'It was this officer,' then he immediately becomes a target,&quot; said Chief Tom Jackson (inset). The six-year veteran is now on paid administrative leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief spoke out after Ferguson was rocked by another night of violent protests - and after some 100 demonstrators marched on the St. Louis County courthouse Tuesday chanting, &quot;Hands up! Don't shoot!&quot; Witnesses have said Brown was holding his hands up in surrender when he was shot.&quot;He was executed in broad daylight,&quot; said Brown family lawyer Benjamin Crump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI has launched a civil rights investigation. Brown pal Dorian Johnson said the two were walking in the street when the cop pulled up to them and barked, &quot;Get the f--- on the sidewalk!&quot;Police initially said the officer fired when one of the teens pushed him into his cruiser and went for his gun.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once more onto the high wire of race for President Obama, once more because a young black man had been shot dead on an American street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Obama offered a deliberately worded plea for peace in Ferguson, Mo., where nights of unrest have followed the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old whose life ended in a confrontation with police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president termed Brown's death &quot;heartbreaking&quot; and called on others, as has Brown's family, to honor his life with nonviolence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,&quot; Obama said in a statement issued by the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that's what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was thus after the 2012 killing in Florida of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, who later was acquitted in the unarmed teenager's death. It was thus after an earlier altercation between a black university professor and a white policeman in Cambridge, Mass., that resulted in the professor's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By virtue of his role as president, Obama represents all Americans, including Zimmerman and the unidentified cop in Missouri who fired the most recent fatal shot. By virtue of his birth, he is keenly aware of the punishments often visited on African American boys and men. Even with his public standing weakened by almost six tumultuous years in office, he remains the American best positioned to explain each side to the other, to try to seed understanding among those still listening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measured nature of Obama's remarks may be in part situational -- the Justice Department is investigating the death, and he can't presuppose the results of their inquiry; the facts of the shooting are in dispute; and any more emotional response might threaten to further inflame the passions he sought to tamp down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not hard to imagine that his private view hews closer to his reaction after 17-year-old Martin was shot dead in a Florida suburb while walking back from a trip to buy Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the spring of 2012, shortly after Martin's death, Obama wrapped him in a familial embrace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon,&quot; he said, personalizing the death in a way no president before him could have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And later, after the verdict cleared Zimmerman, Obama elaborated on the distance between white America and black America, particularly when it comes to the experiences of black men. He offered bracing reminders of the small yet significant slights commonly suffered, and how they burn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are very few African American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me,&quot; the president said. &quot;And there are very few African American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happened to me, at least before I was a senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are very few African Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off. That happens often.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, he added, &quot;that all contributes, I think, to a sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario, that, from top to bottom, both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't different Saturday in Ferguson, nor was the aftermath of Michael Brown's death: the tear-stained anguish of the parents, the national debate, the institutional apparatus of conflict. (The lawyer who represented Martin's family is representing Brown's.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not much distance had been trod in the two years between the deaths of the two young men, and the country seemed not that much further along in what Obama described in his elaboration last year as &quot;this long, difficult journey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, we're becoming a more perfect union -- not a perfect union, but a more perfect union,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CLAYTON, MO.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet again, the protesters took to the sidewalks and streets, facing a row of police guarding the St. Louis County prosecutor's office. &quot;Hands up!&quot; they chanted, their arms aloft. &quot;Don't shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is how the boy died!&quot; Kendrick Strong, 42, hollered at police officers Tuesday morning. &quot;This is how the boy died! With his hands up in the air!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As St. Louis' predominantly black northern quarter has teetered toward chaos the last four days after police in the suburb of Ferguson killed an unarmed black 18-year-old, the chant has been one inescapable constant amid the worry and confusion and clamor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hands-up -- a sign of surrender and submission black men and boys here say they learn early on when dealing with police -- has been transformed into a different kind of weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're angry, throw your arms up,&quot; said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who traveled to St. Louis in the wake of the death of Michael Brown. &quot;If you want justice, throw your arms up. Because that's the sign Michael was using. He had a surrender sign. That's the sign you have to deal with. Use the sign he last showed. We want answers why that last sign was not respected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was shot and killed by an officer Saturday while Brown, according to witnesses, was running away with his hands up. Police say the shooting occurred after a struggle between Brown and a policeman over the officer's gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the days since the shooting, riot police have been sweeping the streets in scenes that might be more recognizable in the Middle East. Stores have been looted, a gas station burned, a Catholic charity's window smashed. Teens have hurled rocks at cops. Officers have launched tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Brown's parents, has demanded that police identify the officer who shot Brown, but the Ferguson police chief declined to do so, citing death threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama, noting the Justice Department is aiding local officials in investigating the shooting, said in a statement Tuesday, &quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local and national black community organizations have begun deliberating their roles in how to respond to Brown's death. And everyone wonders when the convulsive nighttime violence that has turned Ferguson into an unpredictable &quot;war zone&quot; -- as some officers have put it -- will end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as &quot;Ferguson&quot; has transformed into instantly recognizable shorthand signifying the latest juncture in an unsettled national conversation over race and policing, the &quot;hands up, don't shoot&quot; chant has joined a long line of activist slogans that crystallize the heart of a community's moral outrage: Hell no, we won't go. No justice, no peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators had taken up the chant Monday when hundreds of demonstrators, many older, marched in the streets in front of the Ferguson Police Department, their arms raised toward the blazing sun. About two-thirds of Ferguson's 21,000 residents are African American, and police and city officials are predominantly white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black teens and twentysomethings who took to the streets in Ferguson on Monday night did the same, lifting their hands to the glaring lights of a police chopper and the line of police vehicles -- with officers in front -- trying to keep them at bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they also used the hands-up sign as a tool for provocation, drifting toward the police with their arms up, as if daring them for a response. They mixed the hands-up chant with a taunting, obscene anti-police chant. The police eventually drove the group away with tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Clayton the following morning, the hands-up protest was deployed again to confront police officers, but with more peaceful intentions. For several black men who looked on as a line of demonstrators held up their hands, some while on their knees, the symbol had powerful and even painful personal resonance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Sutton, 24, of St. Louis recalled an incident when he was 18. He had gone to the Saint Louis Galleria Mall with his little brother to pick out a prom suit, but ID checkers at the entrance wouldn't let him in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sutton said that as he walked away with a cellphone to his ear, a police officer grabbed his hand; surprised, he yanked his arm away and then was thrown to the ground, handcuffed and Tasered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That could have been me in '08,&quot; Sutton said of Brown's fate. &quot;I wouldn't be here to tell this story. I wouldn't be here to protest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other men at the Clayton rally, young and old, shared similar stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See this dent?&quot; said Aha Sen Piankhy, 38, tapping a finger to a scar on his face. &quot;I got smacked in the head with a flashlight because I didn't say, 'Yes, sir.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, &quot;I was 14 years old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aha Sen said the hands-up chant was &quot;a good tool&quot; because it showed that police apparently violated the covenant not to shoot when hands are up -- a gesture resented among black boys and men in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown, he said, &quot;knew to put his hands in the air, and they still killed him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Strong said he detests the new symbol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're showing yourself as weak. It says, 'I give up, I surrender to your authority,' &quot; he said. &quot;Whether his hands were up, if they were down, it doesn't matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when a police officer smirked at protesters Tuesday morning, Strong decided, the gesture seemed the best way to express displeasure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colbi Drake, 22, a student at the University of Missouri, had a different outlook on holding her hands up, citing other cases of young unarmed black men around the country who were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a very peaceful way of representing the people who aren't able to do this themselves,&quot; she said. &quot;That was always the symbol of surrendering. 'I have nothing! My hands are up!' Why would you still shoot? It makes no sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then Drake went back to watching the protesters facing police, with their arms raised to the sky.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE FBI has opened an investigation into the death of an unarmed African-American teen who was shot and killed by a St. Louis area cop over the weekend, police said Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, 18, was in retreat with his arms raised when he was fatally shot during a confrontation with a white cop in a suburban street Saturday, witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had his hands up in the air and the officer continued shooting - which is an execution,&quot; charged the victim's grandfather, Leslie McSpadden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's relatives spoke on MSNBC with the Rev. Al Sharpton, who plans on traveling to their home in Ferguson, Mo., Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They demand justice,&quot; family lawyer Benjamin Crump said. &quot;He was running away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the day after the shooting, crowds gathered in Ferguson for what was supposed to be a peaceful candlelight vigil - but it turned into a night of looting and mayhem, which his family quickly denounced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not for this,&quot; Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said on Sharpton's program. &quot;The violence needs to stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People looted a convenience store, a check-cashing store and a boutique, among other businesses. And there were scattered reports of gunshots throughout the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were protests and unrest on Monday night as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer in Brown's shooting, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and was placed on paid administrative leave, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our understanding at this point in the investigation, that within the police car, there was a struggle over the officer's weapon,&quot; he said at a press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Phillip Walker, who said he watched the incident from his porch, told The Associated Press that Brown &quot;was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued&quot; when he was shot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE FBI has opened an investigation into the death of an unarmed African-American teen who was shot and killed by a St. Louis area cop over the weekend, police said Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, 18, was in retreat with his arms raised when he was fatally shot during a confrontation with a white cop in a suburban street Saturday, witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had his hands up in the air and the officer continued shooting - which is an execution,&quot; charged the victim's grandfather, Leslie McSpadden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's relatives were speaking on MSNBC with the Rev. Al Sharpton, who plans on traveling to their home in Ferguson, Mo., Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They demand justice,&quot; family lawyer Benjamin Crump said. &quot;He was running away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds gathered in Ferguson the night after the shooting at what was supposed to be a peaceful candlelight vigil - but it turned into a night of looting and mayhem, which his family quickly denounced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not for this,&quot; Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said on Sharpton's program. &quot;The violence needs to stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People looted a convenience store, a check-cashing store and a boutique, among other businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were scattered reports of gunshots throughout the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer in Brown's shooting, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and was placed on administrative leave, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our understanding at this point in the investigation, that within the police car, there was a struggle over the officer's weapon,&quot; he said at a press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Phillip Walker, who said he watched the incident from his porch, told The Associated Press that Brown &quot;was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's family lawyer said the victim - who was set to start college this week - was shot up to eight times. He accused the cop of leaving the dying teenager on the roadway and taking off without summoning medical help.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FERGUSON, MO.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters, almost all of them black, raised their fists and chanted, &quot;We shall not be moved!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down the hill, advancing against them late Monday night, were police officers in gas masks and riot gear, most of them white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't shoot!&quot; some of the demonstrators yelled, inching closer to the barely visible police line. One man drifted closer with his arms up, lifting his shirt and spinning around as if to say: Look, no gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then an older woman in a dust mask to shield her a bit from the swirling tear gas spotted him and shouted, &quot;Get your ass back here!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two sides were locked in confrontation in this working-class suburb of St. Louis, where the police shooting of an unarmed young black man triggered a night of looting Sunday -- and demands for justice from a predominantly black population. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nighttime standoff and billowing tear gas on West Florissant Avenue reflected simmering racial tensions in Ferguson, population 21,000, where two-thirds of residents are black but police and city officials are predominantly white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a suburb abandoned by some whites as blacks moved in decades ago, the death Saturday of Michael Brown, 18, brought national attention to what many black residents say is a pattern of racial injustice here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Justice Department announced an investigation in conjunction with a separate county police inquiry, black leaders called for nonviolence but accused local police and other officials of condoning racism in Ferguson and greater St. Louis for too long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the greater picture, what we saw ... was the boiling over of tensions that had been going on for a long while,&quot; said Antonio French, a St. Louis city alderman who is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Clark of the St. Louis nonprofit Community Outreach for a Better Life said the violence following Brown's death was &quot;due to a total alienation of a certain class of African Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson's police chief and mayor are white. Of the six City Council members, one is black. The local school board has six white members and one Latino. Of the 53 commissioned officers on the police force, three are black, said Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blacks in Ferguson are twice as likely to be stopped by police as whites, according to a report on racial profiling by the Missouri attorney general. Last year, 93% of arrests after car stops were of blacks, the report said, and 92% of searches and 80% of car stops involved blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was walking down a street with a friend Saturday when, according to police, an officer drove up and tried to get out of his car. Brown pushed the officer back into the car, then entered the vehicle as the two men struggled over the officer's gun, according to Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the altercation a shot was fired inside the car, Belmar said. The officer and Brown then got out of the car, and at that point the fatal shooting occurred, Belmar said. Brown was shot &quot;more than just a couple of times,&quot; but it was unclear how many shots were fired, Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses challenged the police version of events. One resident, Piaget Crenshaw, said Brown &quot;ran for his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They shot him and he fell,&quot; Crenshaw said. &quot;He put his arms up to let them know that he was compliant and he was unarmed, and they shot him twice more and he fell to the ground and died.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Mayor James Knowles pledged in a televised interview that &quot;justice will be served&quot; and called on the people of Ferguson to &quot;have faith in the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the police station Monday morning, protesters said they wanted the police officer identified, fired and charged in the killing. They also demanded that the Ferguson police force reflect the racial demographic of the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are angry, people are hurt, people are fed up,&quot; said one protester, Derek Laney, 49, of St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerryl Christmas, 50, a defense attorney and former prosecutor for the city of St. Louis, watched from the sidewalk Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look out here right now,&quot; Christmas said, gesturing to the line of white police officers. &quot;The lack of black police officers either on the street or at the administrative level.... This whole area, this city is a racial powder keg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As riot police squeezed protesters farther down the street Monday morning, Jackson, the city's police chief, stood in the shade of a billboard across from the police station. He said he was shot at three times during Sunday night's riots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said about 12 businesses were damaged by a crowd that smashed windows, looted stores and set a fire inside a mini-mart. Police arrested 32 people for looting. Several police officers were slightly injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said he planned to identify the suspended officer involved in Brown's shooting after he contacted him -- in case the officer wanted to go elsewhere for his own safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police arrested seven people during Monday's demonstration in the morning, Jackson said. &quot;We want them to be able to protest,&quot; he said. But after peaceful protesters left, they were replaced by angry demonstrators &quot;not so much interested in peaceful resolution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Brown's parents wiped away tears at a news conference in Ferguson, their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, told reporters: &quot;I don't want to sugarcoat. That brother was executed in broad daylight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump, who also represented the parents of slain Florida teen Trayvon Martin, said the Brown family and many other Ferguson residents didn't trust the police or local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are devastated that this happens again and again and it's swept under the rug again and again,&quot; Crump said. &quot;Not this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's parents said they had planned to drop off their son to begin community college on Monday. Instead, they were planning his funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesley McSpadden, Brown's mother, wept as she held up a photo of her son. &quot;We are going to do this right,&quot; she said. &quot;We don't want no violence because Michael wouldn't have wanted violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael's father, Michael Brown Sr., repeated three times: &quot;We need justice for our son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday afternoon, the sound of hammers could be heard for more than a mile up and down West Florissant Avenue, where looters had smashed windows at fast-food restaurants, auto shops and other buildings the night before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workers hustled to replace Zisser Tire's windows with plywood. Thieves had stolen tire rims from the showroom; video captured one thief using a rim to smash out each window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dennis G. Ferguson, a salesman for the store, said he had called the owner the night before and debated bringing in rifles as looters worked their way down the street. Ultimately, he decided against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson insisted that the looting did not reflect the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a nice community,&quot; he said, recounting that residents had helped protect businesses overnight. &quot;We had several teenagers come by to see if they could help clean up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday night, police dispersed the demonstrators who had threatened renewed chaos. Many on the front lines were teenagers too.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A black teenager who was fatally shot by a police officer had his hands raised when the officer approached him with his weapon drawn and fired repeatedly, according to two men who said they witnessed the shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI opened an investigation Monday into the death of 18-yearold Michael Brown, who police said was shot multiple times Saturday after being confronted by an officer in Ferguson, a 21,000-resident suburb of St. Louis that's nearly 70 per cent black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities were vague about exactly what led the officer to open fire, except to say that the shooting was preceded by a scuffle of some kind. It was unclear whether Brown or a man he was with was involved in the altercation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing sparked a night of unrest in Ferguson and drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighbourhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators have refused to disclose the race of the officer, who is now on administrative leave. But Phillip Walker said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Brown on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown &quot;was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued,&quot; Walker said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer &quot;had his gun raised and started shooting the individual in the chest multiple times.&quot; The officer then &quot;stood over him and shot him&quot; after the victim fell wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson offered a similar account, saying he and Brown were walking home from a convenience store when a police officer told them to get out of the street and on to the sidewalk. Johnson said they kept walking, which caused the officer to confront them from his car and again after getting out of his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said the first time the officer fired, he and Brown got scared and ran away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wasn't causing harm to nobody. We had no weapons on us at all.&quot; Walker said that he did not see a scuffle or the circumstances surrounding the first gunshot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis County Police Department refused to discuss Johnson's remarks, citing the ongoing investigation. But county police Chief Jon Belmar previously said that an officer encountered Brown and another man outside an apartment complex, and that one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and they struggled over the officer's weapon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A STRUGGLE over a cop's gun led to Saturday's lethal shooting of an unarmed black teenager in suburban St. Louis, officials claimed Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the mother of 18-year-old Michael Brown did not accept the official version of the killing of her son - and said the officer who fired the deadly shots deserved the ultimate punishment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,&quot; a grieving Lesley McSpadden said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McSpadden retained Florida attorney Benjamin Crump, who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed teen whose death at the hands of a neighborhood watchman shocked the nation, a spokesman for the lawyer told the Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family's outrage and the hiring of a high-profile lawyer came as police defended themselves on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the officer was attacked after he encountered Brown and another person Saturday afternoon in front of an apartment complex in Ferguson, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the unnamed cop exited his squad car, one of the men pushed him back inside, where there was a struggle over the officer's weapon, Belmar said. At least one shot was fired in the car, hitting no one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cop jumped out of his car and gave chase, striking Brown &quot;more than a couple times&quot; about 35 feet from the car, Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the shell casings at the scene matched bullets from the officer's gun, Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,&quot; he said, adding it is unclear which of the men was struggling with the cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the law enforcement officials addressed the media at a local firehouse, hundreds of protesters chanted outside, &quot;Don't shoot!&quot; Later, some marched inside the adjacent police building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a vigil, some looting and vandalism broke out in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb. Several dozen protesters faced off with police in riot gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said he had instructed lawyers in the department's Civil Rights Division to monitor developments in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Rev. Al Sharpton announced that he planned to visit the area at the request of Brown's family to ensure a fair investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives continued to express disbelief at the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My grandson never even got into a fight,&quot; said grandmother Desiree Harris. &quot;He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A STRUGGLE over a cop's gun led to Saturday's lethal shooting of an unarmed black teenager in suburban St. Louis, officials claimed Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the mother of 18-year-old Michael Brown did not accept the official version of the killing of her son - and said the officer who fired the deadly shots deserved the ultimate punishment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,&quot; a grieving Lesley McSpadden said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the officer was attacked after he encountered Brown and another person Saturday afternoon in front of an apartment complex in Ferguson, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the unnamed cop exited his squad car, one of the men pushed him back inside, where there was a struggle over the officer's weapon, Belmar said. At least one shot was fired in the car, hitting no one, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cop jumped out of his car and gave chase, striking Brown &quot;more than a couple times&quot; about 35 feet from the car, Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the shell casings at the scene matched bullets from the officer's gun. Brown did not have a weapon, Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,&quot; he said, adding it is unclear which of the men was struggling with the cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the second person with Brown has not been arrested or charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the law enforcement officials addressed the media at a local firehouse, hundreds of protesters chanted outside, &quot;Don't shoot!&quot; Later, some marched inside the adjacent police building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a vigil, some looting and vandalism broke out in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb. Several dozen protesters faced off with police in riot gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said he had instructed lawyers in the department's Civil Rights Division to monitor developments in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Rev. Al Sharpton announced that he planned to visit the area at the request of Brown's family to ensure a fair investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives continued to express disbelief at the killing of the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My grandson never even got into a fight,&quot; said grandmother Desiree Harris. &quot;He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local news reports said Brown was set to start college Monday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unarmed teenager fatally shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., on Saturday had been struggling for the officer's gun, law enforcement officials said Sunday as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the police department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the youth, Michael Brown, 18, allegedly struggled for a Ferguson police officer's weapon in a patrol car before the officer fired several shots about noon Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said the youth, who was black, had his hands in the air as he fled the patrol car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis County Police Department, separate from the Ferguson police, is handling the investigation, which Belmar said would be thorough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are investigating this incident as we would any other shooting,&quot; said a statement on the St. Louis County Police Department's Facebook page. &quot;There is no bias or favoritism applied as we are an outside agency and were not involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement added: &quot;The FBI will be contacted today and notified of the incident. If they choose, they may conduct a separate use-of-force investigation on this incident directly with the Ferguson Police Department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer who fired the shots has been placed on paid administrative leave and has not been identified. He has been on the force for six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar said Brown was shot &quot;more than just a couple of times,&quot; but it was unclear how many shots were fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was walking with a friend in the middle of the street when a Ferguson police officer pulled up and tried to get out of his vehicle, Belmar said. Brown allegedly pushed the officer back into the car, Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar said Brown reportedly entered the police car and a struggle ensued over the officer's weapon. One shot was fired inside the car, Belmar said. The fatal shooting occurred after the officer and Brown left the vehicle, Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses' accounts have differed from that of police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorin Johnson, a friend of the victim, told the local Fox affiliate, Fox 2, that he was walking in the street with Brown when the squad car pulled up and an officer told them to get on the sidewalk. &quot;It was not but a minute from our destination and we would be off the street,&quot; Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said the officer didn't get out of his patrol car, but reached &quot;his arm out the window and grabbed my friend around the neck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness, Piaget Crenshaw, told Fox 2: &quot;I witnessed the police chase after the guy, full force. He ran for his life. They shot him and he fell. He put his arms up to let them know that he was compliant and he was unarmed, and they shot him twice more and he fell to the ground and died.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, residents gathered to protest at the shooting scene. The crowd grew to as large as 1,000, according to local media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While St. Louis County police spoke at the Ferguson station Sunday morning, protesters gathered, holding up their hands and saying, &quot;Don't shoot me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People says it will seek a federal investigation. Two Justice Department representatives arrived in St. Louis late Sunday, an NAACP official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's mother told the Associated Press that she didn't understand why the police officer didn't subdue her son with a club or Taser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to see him fired,&quot; Lesley McSpadden said of the officer. &quot;I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few thousand people gathered for a candlelight vigil Sunday night, the Associated Press reported.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN 18-YEAR-OLD Missouri man - reportedly unarmed - was shot dead by a cop on Saturday, triggering outrage among residents, who gathered at the scene shouting &quot;kill the police.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown (pictured) was on his way to his grandmother's house in the city of Ferguson, 12 miles north of St. Louis, when he was gunned down at about 2:15 p.m., cops and his relatives said. What prompted the Ferguson Police Department officer to fire wasn't immediately clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multiple witnesses told KMOV TV that Brown was unarmed and tried to put his hands up after the cop fired his first shot. The officer &quot;shot again and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air,&quot; said witness Dorian Johnson. &quot;He started to get down and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops said they were trying to determine what led to the shooting. &quot;We're still trying to piece together what happened and why,&quot; St. Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, promising a &quot;lengthy investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting created bedlam in Ferguson. Some 200 irate residents filled the streets, screaming and cursing at cops. A handful of them came face-to-face with police officers, as a police dog paced nearby, barking, reported the Post-Dispatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please don't shoot me!&quot; they hollered. &quot;Please don't shoot me!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louis Head, Brown's stepfather, held a sign that read: &quot;Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was a 2014 graduate of Normandy High School and was scheduled to begin classes at Vatterott College on Monday, relatives said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told the Post-Dispatch that the officer who shot Brown was placed on paid administrative leave. State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed said she would petition the U.S. Justice Department on Monday to launch a formal investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County NAACP President Esther Haywood expressed outrage over the incident, and evoked the death of Eric Garner, the Staten Island man who died on July 17 after an NYPD cop put him in an apparent chokehold. &quot;We are hurt to hear that yet another teenaged boy has been slaughtered by law enforcement, especially in light of the recent death of Eric Garner in New York, who was killed for selling cigarettes,&quot; Haywood said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are police becoming less like public servants - and more like elite military forces?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a pointed and important question being asked in the United States, following what many believe was a disproportionate display of force Wednesday in Ferguson, Mo., where demonstrations have taken place daily since the shooting of an unarmed teenager on the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a live video stream that night, protesters appeared to be peaceful. They were chanting and shouting for justice in the wake of Michael Brown's death, but they were not at that point engaging in violence. The police, however, responded with stun grenades, tear gas, smoke bombs and a piercing acoustical weapon - along with the arrest of journalists simply doing their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That type of response - what some would call increasing &quot;militarization&quot; of police forces - was raised in detail in June, with the release of an American Civil Liberties Union report titled &quot;War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing.&quot; Among other things, the report analyzed more than 800 special weapons and tactical (SWAT) deployments conducted over a two-year period. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;American policing has become unnecessarily and dangerously militarized,&quot; it states, &quot;in large part through federal programs that have armed state and local law enforcement agencies with the weapons and tactics of war, with almost no public discussion or oversight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many U.S. police forces now have some of the tools usually found in war zones, such as armoured personnel carriers. And some units dress more like special-ops Navy SEALS than anything resembling a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The use of hyper-aggressive tools and tactics results in tragedy for civilians and police officers, escalates the risk of needless violence, destroys property and undermines individual liberties,&quot; the report states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of the SWAT deployments studied (62 per cent) were carried out for the purpose of drug searches. And that, says the ACLU, is not an appropriate use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;SWAT was created to deal with emergency situations such as hostage, barricade and active shooter scenarios,&quot; says its report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over time, however, law enforcement agencies have moved away from this original purpose and are increasingly using these paramilitary squads to search people's homes for drugs,&quot; says the ACLU report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Canada, some observers point to recent developments such as the purchase of a sound cannon - able to send protesters scurrying with intense and temporarily disabling sound pressure levels - by the Toronto Police Service. Or the mass &quot;kettling&quot; of G20 protesters (and non-protesters alike) by police in full riot gear. Or the removal of name tags, making officers part of a single, anonymous force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those instances, and others, lead to suggestions that the militarization phenomenon is creeping north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is absolutely a very real issue,&quot; says Margaret Beare, professor of law and sociology at York University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We saw it in the G20. Once you armour somebody like that, then the whole function becomes different ... You move away from the pretense of any sort of civility and respect and social justice, and the idea of sort of a negotiated agreement between police and citizens. You lose that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that is indeed happening, some say there's a very real risk that the bond the public ideally feels with police will become supplanted with something very different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They begin to fear the police, rather than seeing the police as their defenders,&quot; says Dalhousie University sociology professor Chris Murphy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police represent the public, are here to protect them. And I think this technology gives off a very different vibe. But, to be fair, we've been pretty restrained in Canada to date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police counters that we're in an age when public perceptions - and misconceptions - can be shaped and distorted very quickly through social media. Throw up a clip of a confrontation without context, and a viewer may reach a skewed conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People's perceptions of their police services are being shaped in a fundamentally different way these days,&quot; says Joe Couto, the association's director of government relations and communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So people watching a YouTube video will draw their own conclusions ... It's incumbent upon police to use the same tools to try to put the context around an incident if we can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Couto also points out that police forces are highly regulated: they cannot simply go out and start buying new weapons and technology just because they feel like it. There is provincial oversight for such purchases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also emphasizes that police are guided by the community policing model, which has its roots in the 1800s in the U.K. with Sir Robert Peel. Under that model, officers are regarded as fellow citizens, with the responsibility to exercise their powers with the public's implicit consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in Ontario, we've always been very cognizant of the need to ensure that our model of policing is consistent with that British model of policing,&quot; he says. &quot;I can tell you every time we purchase a new tool, there's a reason behind it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others suggest Canadian police are influenced, some say heavily, by U.S. policing trends. Chiefs attend some common conferences where new tools and techniques are explored. Some also suggest the notion of community policing today bears little resemblance to what Peel envisioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The original idea of police being purely servants of the public, enforcing the law and maintaining order and preventing crime - that kind of soft approach to policing long ago was dissolved in favour of a more harder-line law enforcement approach,&quot; says Simon Fraser University criminology professor and associate dean Rob Gordon, who in a previous career was a police officer in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've noticed a creeping militarization in this country ... because policing fashions in the U.S. tend to have a fairly major impact on policing fashions in Canada ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We acquired SWAT teams sometime after the Americans did,&quot; Gordon notes. &quot;What started out as being an initiative and a unit that was to deal with a short-term problem has now become an established feature of policing. And if you don't have a SWAT team, you're quite clearly policing in the boonies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says even the nature of the uniforms has changed. Peel, back in the 1800s, insisted that police uniforms be very different from anything resembling the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they're dressed like combat troops in Iraq (as some special units do), I think that's not a good image.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also consensus, at least among academics, that using more military-like tools can change how a situation might unfold. Rather than negotiate an end to a crisis, the temptation might be to force it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's sort of this 'fix it now' attitude that you get when you have all this equipment,&quot; says Gordon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police is adamant the community policing model will continue to guide forces into the future. But spokesperson Couto acknowledges that, despite the fact police are fellow citizens operating with our consent, they have a job that occasionally takes them out of that friendly community role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We understand how the perception could be that it's sort of a military force,&quot; he says. &quot;But policing in its very nature is paramilitary. Let's not forget that police officers are citizens who are given special responsibilities and duties to enforce laws. That's the nature of policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've talked to some folks on social media who say couldn't we have officers who don't have firearms - the traditional Bobby of the old days. Unfortunately, our world is different. And so our tools are different.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US PRESIDENT Barack Obama called for &quot;a time of healing&quot; yesterday as a sixth night of racially-charged protests loomed in Missouri following the death of a black teenager at the hands of police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama broke off from his holiday to address the situation in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson, which has been engulfed by demonstrations and violence since the shooting of Michael Brown on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president said: &quot;I know emotions are raw right now. We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old. His family will never hold Michael in their arms again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is never an excuse for violence against police. There is also no excuse for police to use excessive force against protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now is a time for healing. Now is a time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's a time for open and transparent process to see justice is done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Ferguson looks like a war zone that may be because its police force is armed to the teeth with military equipment. In photographs from this week's protests, officers can be seen toting assault rifles, wearing gas masks and body armour loaded with extra ammunition magazines, and riding around in mine-resistant armoured personnel carriers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The militarisation of US police departments has escalated exponentially in the years since 9/11, with many local forces increasingly resembling US troops fighting overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wound down, much of the military's surplus equipment has been handed to domestic law enforcement agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a recent report by the New York Times, since 2006 US police departments have collectively acquired 93,763 machine guns; 432 mine-resistant trucks; more than 500 aircraft; thousands of pieces of camouflage and night vision gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A deeply unequal society If the unrest continues in Ferguson, the truth is that troubles could have erupted in any number of cities - because America, 50 years after the Civil Rights Act was passed, remains a deeply unequal society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State and national leaders scrambled yesterday to show they are sensitive to the grievances of African-Americans in urban communities like Ferguson near St Louis, which has seen successive nights of tumult and confrontation in the wake of the shooting of Mr Brown by a white police officer last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Footage of the chaos on the streets of Ferguson has dominated newscasts, yet attempts to ease tensions have faltered as local police commanders have chosen to deploy overwhelming force and have declined to release the identity of the officer who shot Mr Brown.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aspiring college student Michael Brown, 18, died on Saturday in a police shooting in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson, sparking rioting and stirring comparisons to the February 2012 fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wesley Lowery, a Washington Post political reporter, and Ryan Reilly, a Huffington Post reporter, were arrested in a McDonald's after police entered the restaurant and ordered people to leave, the pair wrote on Twitter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier on Wednesday in Ferguson, police fired several shots at a 19-year-old who pointed a handgun in their direction as they dispersed around 30 people who had gathered near where the rioting had occurred, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young man was taken to hospital, his name has not been released.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">578 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 15--The problem in Ferguson, Mo., is self-evident. The police department has a problem with its workplace culture. It is at war with the very people it is supposed to serve and protect, and it was that way before unarmed black teenager Michael Brown Jr. was shot by a police officer reportedly 10 times in broad daylight, prompting nightly protests this past week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the difference between quality police officers and troubling police officers often comes down to the workplace environment from which they were dispatched. How do they view their public? Are they a boys' club of guys who love to swap stories of using force or are they a professional, accountable workforce well-trained in the rights of Americans? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most police departments in cities big and small are quite oriented toward the communities they serve. Whether it is Houston, Texas, or Albert Lea, Minn., the officers seek to serve and protect the residents who live there, even if it means at times doing menial jobs like knocking on the door of an elderly widow to check on her for a relative who is out of town, assisting with pedestrian crossings on school days or chit-chatting with patrons of local bars. It's not the exciting police work we see on television, but it is an unsung-yet-noble duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, quality law enforcement agencies continue to receive training, learning the up-to-date techniques and understanding best practices. A professional policing environment grows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police officers who join professional, community-oriented police forces join in the culture and, no surprise here, they become the kind of police officers quite reserved in the need to use force because they see people -- even the troublemakers -- as people, not as enemies. They are the smart ones who keep a pack of cigarettes in the glove compartment because offering a smoke can be an easier way to calm an unruly person down than a thump on the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reading accounts of how the Ferguson and St. Louis County police treated the people of Ferguson revealed that the police and the public both had an us-versus-them situation and rights were being trampled on without concerns, which leads to no surprises when police officers went so far as to arrest journalists exercising their First Amendment-guaranteed rights to freedom of the press and assembly. We weren't there to witness the situation in person, but from all accounts, the arrests and the many other accounts of mistreatment imply an out-of-hand police force in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someone had to do something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We applaud the decision by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Thursday to place the Missouri Highway Patrol in charge of Ferguson, as the local police forces were doing more to stir the pot of unrest in that city than to calm it. Even President Barack Obama expressed concern publicly Thursday about the actions of the Ferguson and St. Louis County police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor's actions came as we were writing this editorial Thursday. We had planned to call for a more professional police force to supplant the Ferguson police. Nixon and his advisers apparently recognized the same need and took action. We look forward to the Missouri state troopers not only restoring order but earning the respect of the citizenry -- who no doubt wish to be treated as citizens, not as enemy combatants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember (her) telling me there's certain things I need to do to avoid getting killed by police,&quot; said Wilton, 25. &quot;I'm tired of seeing this on the news and it just passing over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, 18, was shot to death Saturday by a Ferguson police officer. Nightly protests have followed in the St. Louis suburb, marked by incidents of civil unrest and what's being called a militaristic response by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday's rally in Decatur, organized through social media, included a moment of silence held at similar protests across the country. Police presence was minimal in Decatur and the crowd of about 200 remained peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there was no hiding the anger shared by many who attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police culture incites violence,&quot; said Inga Willis, 37, of southwest Atlanta. &quot;These things accumulate. They build, then they burst. That's what's happening in Ferguson. When faced with an impossible situation, all you can do is fight back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some, the shooting of Brown hit too close to home.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of demonstrators streamed into the Inner Harbor on Thursday evening to protest police misconduct and brutality and stand in solidarity with residents of Ferguson, Mo., where the fatal police shooting of an 18-year-old has sparked days of civil unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally began as dozens of people gathered outside the Clarence M. Mitchell Jr. Courthouse, then walked southeast to city police headquarters to decry the deaths of men in the custody of Baltimore police or after police interactions. The group grew in size in front of City Hall as protesters marched together through rush-hour traffic to the Inner Harbor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hands up, don't shoot,&quot; people shouted as they went. Just after 7 p.m., those in the crowd of about 300 raised their hands high, hung their heads low and observed a moment of silence to remember Michael Brown, the 18-year-old killed Saturday by a Ferguson police officer and whose death has sparked days of unrest in the St. Louis suburb. Around the country, other demonstrators were doing the same, organized by a social media campaign called the National Moment of Silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All along the way, Baltimore traffic police escorted the group while uniformed officers stood quietly on the outskirts of the crowd. There were no guns pointed at protesters, as was the case in Ferguson on Wednesday night. Instead, several Baltimore police officers pointed camcorders at the crowd for reasons police did not disclose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For police officers, there is a double standard. Police can kill at will,&quot; the Rev. Cortly &quot;C.D.&quot; Witherspoon, president of the Baltimore chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, told the crowd. &quot;We're here states and states away to stand in solidarity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The marchers said the events in Ferguson tapped into their own feelings of police mistrust, and the names of black men and boys who have died after interactions with Baltimore police were evoked repeatedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm here because of the history of murder that has been perpetrated upon the citizens of Baltimore and all over the nation,&quot; said Patricia Salter, 54, who described herself as a caseworker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As similar sentiments were spoken through a loudspeaker outside police headquarters, officers standing on guard showed no emotion. City officials, preparing for the demonstration, erected bike-rack fencing around City Hall and the Inner Harbor. Authorities did not interrupt protesters in any fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the names most often repeated by the crowd were those of Tyrone West and Anthony Anderson, two men who died in Baltimore police custody in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Their deaths prompted previous protests against police and prosecutors, who cleared officers of any wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West, 44, died July 18, 2013, after police said he fought with officers after a traffic stop in Northeast Baltimore. Based on accounts from witnesses, West's family believes police used excessive force and killed him. An autopsy determined he died after the summer heat and the struggle with officers exacerbated a heart condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baltimore police authorized an independent review of the arrest, released last week, that showed that while officers didn't use excessive force, they did not follow protocols and &quot;potentially aggravated the situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said the officers did not follow procedures after pulling over West, detectives conducted a biased investigation and the department has too many inexperienced officers in positions that aren't adequately supervised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson, 46, died Sept. 21, 2012, after Baltimore police tackled him after allegedly observing him slip a bag of heroin gel capsules into his mouth. Medical examiners ruled that he died of blunt force trauma after his spleen was ruptured, causing internal bleeding. State pathologists say he also had a liver ailment that limited his ability to clot blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speakers also often mentioned George V. King, a 19-year-old foster youth, who was a patient at Good Samaritan Hospital. On May 7, the King family's attorney and law enforcement sources say, a fight between him and hospital staff drew a police officer who used his Taser five times to subdue King, who died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Young people are afraid of the police,&quot; said Greta Carter. She runs the Kevin L. Cooper Foundation, named for her 14-year-old son who died after a Baltimore police officer shot him in 2006. She hopes it will improve community and police relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carter had called police to help with the disruptive boy. Police said the teen hit the officer with a broom handle which broke and came at the officer again with its jagged edge. Carter has maintained that her son didn't touch the officer, who she has said was antagonizing the teen as she stood between them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer did not face criminal charges and was cleared administratively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They kill them, then they come together and lock ranks,&quot; Carter told demonstrators through a megaphone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ferguson, the Rev. Jamal-Harrison Bryant of Baltimore's Empowerment Temple has taken an active and prominent role organizing activists and residents demonstrating against what they believe to be serious problems of racial inequity. Bryant also flew to Florida in 2012 to stand with Trayvon Martin's family and took an active role in calling for charges against the neighborhood watch coordinator who shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been really a disturbing and inspiring, all at the same time, moment for me,&quot; he said over the phone. &quot;Even working through the Trayvon Martin case, I've never seen the kind of stress and anxiety that I've witnessed in Ferguson. Thousands of young people have taken to the streets, looking visibly shaken, looking for answers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bryant said law enforcement authorities in Ferguson, in addition to using unnecessary rubber bullets and tear gas on peaceful protesters, are stonewalling residents about why Brown was killed. He said investigators need to release the name of the officer who shot Brown so his background can be scrutinized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting death, Bryant said, and the recent death of a black man who died while being detained by New York City police have galvanized people across the country to unify and speak out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's opening up a larger debate or national conversation about police brutality or police inequity in the case of minorities,&quot; he said. &quot;You cannot minimize or ignore the response and the traction that public outrage begins to pull together.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. -- After several nights of tense street confrontations, state and federal authorities stepped in Thursday to curb the aggressive tactics of local police against demonstrators protesting the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon dispatched the state Highway Patrol to take over security in Ferguson, promising &quot;a softer front&quot; to law enforcement after images of police wielding automatic weapons, flash grenades and tear gas drew stunned reactions from across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,&quot; Nixon said at a news conference. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black and grew up in this predominantly black suburb of St. Louis, was tapped to lead the effort. &quot;It means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the day, Johnson joined demonstrators near the scene of previous confrontations stemming from the fatal weekend shooting and exchanged hugs and handshakes with protesters as they passed. Officers stood by with casual demeanors, without visible body armor or rifles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man told Johnson his niece had been hit with tear gas during the demonstrations. &quot;What would you say to her?&quot; the man asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tell her Capt. Johnson is sorry, and he apologizes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama weighed in from his vacation in Martha's Vineyard, Mass., saying that he has asked Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who several witnesses said had his hands up when he was killed. &quot;We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances,&quot; the president said. &quot;He was 18 years old, and his family will never hold Michael in their arms again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama issued a stern admonition to both police and looters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racial dynamic of the city has long been a volatile mix: two-thirds of residents are black, while police and city officials are predominantly white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When demonstrations began after the shooting Saturday, the feeling that police viewed residents as foes inflamed anger on the streets, as did officials' refusal to release the name of the officer who shot Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large protests over the past several days have been mostly peaceful during daylight hours. But after vandals looted 12 businesses Sunday night, officers in military vehicles and riot gear swarmed into neighborhoods, ordering demonstrators to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers fired stun grenades, tear gas canisters, beanbags and rubber bullets on those who didn't comply. A small minority of the crowds lobbed bottles, rocks and Molotov cocktails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar clashes were repeated over the next three nights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., has urged the Justice Department to take a stronger role in ending the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to demilitarize the situation,&quot; she said. &quot;This kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a church in Florissant, a town neighboring Ferguson, residents expressed their outrage over Brown's killing. But they said they also were concerned about the aggressive police presence in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you go out, you better be wearing the armor of God,&quot; said Sierra Smith, 27, who lives near the place where Brown was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tremaine Combs, 32, said he took his son to a store, when his son spotted a police officer driving by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was so terrified that he started crying, and he's only 5 years old,&quot; Combs said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clark McPhail, a top expert on controlling public gatherings and a professor emeritus at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said police appeared to have made serious errors in handling the scene in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were geared up as though they were going into combat,&quot; he said. &quot;I am always stunned when I see police agencies behave that way in the 21st century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As officers and federal agents planned for Thursday night's deployment, FBI and Justice Department investigators from St. Louis and Washington spoke with key witnesses to the shooting incident that left Brown dead, Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozingo reported from Los Angeles. Tribune Newspapers' Maya Srikrishnan and Lauren Rabb in Los Angeles and Richard A. Serrano in Washington contributed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama called for &quot;a time of healing&quot; yesterday as a sixth night of racially-charged protests loomed following the death of a black teenager at the hands of police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama broke off from his holiday to address the situation in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson, which has been engulfed by demonstrations and violence since the shooting of Michael Brown on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president said: &quot;I know emotions are raw right now. We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18-years-old. His family will never hold Michael in their arms again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is never an excuse for violence against police. There is also no excuse for police to use excessive force against protesters. Now is a time for healing. Now is a time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's a time for open and transparent process to see justice is done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Ferguson looks like a war zone that may be because its police force is armed to the teeth with military equipment. In photographs from this week's protests, officers can be seen toting assault rifles, wearing gas masks and body armour loaded with extra ammunition magazines, and riding around in mine-resistant armoured personnel carriers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The militarisation of US police departments has escalated exponentially in the years since 9/11, with many local forces increasingly resembling US troops fighting overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a recent report by the New York Times, since 2006 US police departments have collectively acquired 93,763 machine guns; 432 mine-resistant trucks; more than 500 aircraft; thousands of pieces of camouflage and night vision gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to ease tensions have faltered as local police commanders have chosen to deploy overwhelming force to repel protesters and have declined to release the identity of the officer who opened fire on Mr Brown, days before he was to start college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, told a meeting of residents that &quot;you will all see a different tone&quot; in the police response, after announcing unspecified &quot;operational shifts&quot; in law enforcement tactics.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri state police are taking over security from local officers in the St Louis suburb that has been the scene of violent protests since a white police officer shot dead an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Barack Obama has appealed for &quot;peace and calm&quot; on the streets of Ferguson, the predominantly black city where crowds have gathered to protest since Saturday's shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governor Jay Nixon announced that state highway patrol captain Ron Johnson, who is black, will take over security after the local police response drew heavy criticism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nixon said the change was intended to make sure &quot;that we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit and let some of the energy be felt in this region appropriately&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His promise to ease the deep racial tensions was swiftly put to the test as demonstrators gathered again last night in the neighbourhood where looters smashed and burned businesses on Sunday and police repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capt Johnson said he grew up in the community and &quot;it means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence&quot;. He said he planned to keep heavily armoured vehicles away from the scene and told his officers not to bring tear gas masks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By late afternoon, Capt Johnson was walking down the street with a group of more than 1,000 protesters as they chanted &quot;Hands up, don't shoot&quot;, a reference to witness accounts that described Mr Brown as having his hands in the air when the officer kept firing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capt Johnson planned to talk to the demonstrators throughout the night. &quot;We're going to have some conversations with them and get an understanding of what's going on,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama, speaking from the Massachusetts island where he is on a two-week holiday, said there was no excuse for excessive force by police in the aftermath of the shooting and he had asked the Justice Department and FBI to investigate the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,&quot; he said. &quot;But let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said officers used tear gas on Wednesday night to disperse a large crowd of protesters after some threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers. More than 10 people were arrested in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents have complained about the police response that began soon after Mr Brown's shooting with the use of dogs for crowd control - a tactic that for some evoked civil-rights protests from a half-century ago. The county police force took over, leading both the investigation of the shooting and the subsequent attempts to keep the peace at the smaller city's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County police chief Jon Belmar said his officers responded with &quot;an incredible amount of restraint&quot; as they had rocks and bottles thrown at them, were shot at and had two dozen patrol vehicles destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city and county are also under fire for refusing to release the name of the officer who shot Mr Brown, citing threats against him and others. Hacker group Anonymous yesterday released a name purported to be that of the officer, but the police chief later said the name was incorrect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twitter quickly suspended the Anonymous account that posted the officer's alleged identity and personal information. The site's code of conduct strictly forbids the publication of private and confidential information without permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Mr Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle then spilled on to the street, where Mr Brown was shot multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer involved was injured, with one side of his face swollen, Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Mr Brown when the shooting happened, told a much different story. He said the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He said Mr Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing several times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Johnson and another witness both say Mr Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US attorney general Eric Holder has said federal investigators have interviewed eyewitnesses and a person familiar with the matter said federal authorities had interviewed Mr Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Holder spoke by telephone with Mr Brown's family yesterday to offer condolences and to tell them that the Justice Department was committed to a full and independent investigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a recent report by the New York Times, since 2006 US police departments have collectively acquired 93,763 machine guns; 432 mine-resistant trucks; more than 500 aircraft; thousands of pieces of camouflage and night vision gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to ease tensions have faltered as local police commanders have chosen to deploy overwhelming force to repel protesters and have declined to release the identity of the officer who opened fire on Mr Brown, days before he was to start college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, told a meeting of residents that &quot;you will all see a different tone&quot; in the police response, after announcing unspecified &quot;operational shifts&quot; in law enforcement tactics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A riot can be many things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be an act of communal madness, reflecting the emotional imbecility of those who believe the best way to express joy at their ball team's win is to overturn a car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be an act of opportunism, a chance, under cover of darkness, influence of chaos, suspension of order, to smash and grab and run away, arms heavy with loot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it can be an act of outcry, a scream of inchoate rage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what happened this week in Ferguson, Mo. The people screamed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To believe that this carnage - the windows smashed, the buildings torched, the tear gas wafting - is all about the killing of Michael Brown is to miss the point. Brown, of course, was the unarmed 18-year-old African-American man shot multiple times by a Ferguson police officer on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because, again, this is not just about Brown. It's about Eric Garner, choked to death in a confrontation with New York City police. It's about Jordan Davis, shot to death in Jacksonville, Fla., because he played his music too loud. It's about Trayvon Martin, shot to death in Sanford, Fla., because a self-appointed neighborhood guardian judged him a thug. It's about Oscar Grant, shot by a police officer in an Oakland, Calif., subway station as cellphone cameras watched. It's about Amadou Diallo, executed in that vestibule and Abner Louima, sodomized with that broomstick. It's about Rodney King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is about the bitter sense of siege that lives in African-American men, a sense that it is perpetually open season on us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that too few people outside of African America really notice, much less care. People who look like you are everyday deprived of health, wealth, freedom, opportunity, education, the benefit of the doubt, the presumption of innocence, life itself - and when you try to say this, even when you document it with academic studies and buttress it with witness testimony, people don't want to hear it, people dismiss you, deny you, lecture you about white victimhood, chastise you for playing a so-called &quot;race card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They choke off avenues of protest, prizing silence over justice, mistaking silence for peace. And never mind that sometimes, silence simmers like water in a closed pot on a high flame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One can never condone a riot. It is a self-defeating act that sells some fleeting illusion of satisfaction at a high cost in property and life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But understanding this does not preclude recognizing that the anger we see in Ferguson did not spring from nowhere, nor arrive, fully formed, when Michael Brown was shot. It is the anger of people who are, as Fannie Lou Hamer famously said, sick and tired of being sick and tired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silence imposed on pain cannot indefinitely endure. People who are hurting will always, eventually, make themselves heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if they must scream to do so.</SPAN></P>

Photo: Reuters St Louis residents and police clash over death By Nick O'Malley in Washington Five days after a police officer shot 18-year-old Michael Brown dead in St Louis, police have yet to cast any light on the killing or even name the officer who pulled the trigger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the official silence more witnesses have come forward to corroborate the grim story first told by the young man Mr Brown was with when he died, 22-year-old Dorian Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr Johnson, the two young men were walking along a street in the suburb of Ferguson, a small community with its own police force, when officers in a pick-up truck rolled past and ordered them to &quot;get the f--- on the sidewalk&quot;. Mr Johnson says the officer leaned out of the window and grabbed Mr Brown around the neck. The two wrestled, a gun discharged and the boys ran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police confirm that Mr Brown's body fell 10 metres from the truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Johnson says Mr Brown was hit once, turned and raised his hands only to be shot several more times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday Tiffany Mitchell, who was driving past as the incident happened, appeared on CNN with her lawyer and said that she observed Mr Brown trying to pull away from the officer as they grappled through the window before running down the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As he runs the police gets out of his vehicle and he follows behind him shooting and the kid's body jerked as if he was hit from behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he turned around and he puts his hands up ... and the cop continues to fire until he dropped down to the ground and his face just smacks into the concrete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each night since Saturday crowds have gathered and police have responded with arrests, tear-gas and rubber bullets. On Wednesday night the nation was shocked by images of police SWAT teams training weapons on peaceful protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many believe that the police response to the shooting has provoked the continuing tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say Mr Brown's body was left in the street for four hours after he died and no ambulance was called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Mitchell told CNN that when his grieving family arrived they were given no details about what had happened. When she tried to tell them what she saw, police sought to prevent her, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday US President Barack Obama addressed the tensions, offering condolences to Mr Brown's family and calling on the community to &quot;comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is impossible to exaggerate how seriously the US takes the spectre of race riots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In The New York Times on Thursday, columnist Charles Blow wrote: &quot;There is an eerie echo in it all - a sense of tragedy too often repeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet the sheer morbid, wrenching rhythm of it belies a larger phenomenon ... &quot;The criminalisation of black and brown bodies - particularly male ones - from the moment they are first introduced to the institutions and power structures with which they must interact.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, MO. (AP) &amp;GT;&amp;GT; A suburban St. Louis police chief today identified the officer whose fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager ignited days of heated protests, and released documents alleging the teen was killed after a robbery in which he was suspected of stealing a $48.99 box of cigars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released several police reports and documents during a news conference where he also identified the officer involved as Darren Wilson, who has been on administrative leave since he shot 18-year-old Michael Brown on Aug. 9. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, were suspected of taking a box of cigars from a store in Ferguson that morning, according to police reports. Jackson said Wilson went to the area after a 911 call reporting a &quot;strong-arm&quot; robbery just before noon. He said a dispatcher gave a description of the robbery suspect, and Wilson, who had been assisting on another call, was sent to investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson, a six-year veteran of the police department, encountered Brown just after 12:01 p.m., with a second officer arriving three minutes later, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's uncle, Bernard Ewing, questioned whether Wilson really believed Brown was a suspect. He noted Johnson's account that the officer told the two young men to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk, and that Brown had his hands up when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he's a robbery suspect, they would have had the lights on,&quot; Ewing said. &quot;If you rob somebody, you would tell them, 'Get on the ground' or something, not, 'Get off the sidewalk.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It still doesn't justify shooting him when he puts his hands up,&quot; he added. &quot;You still don't shoot him in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A phone message seeking comment from the family's attorney, Benjamin Crump, wasn't immediately returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's death has sparked several days of clashes with furious protesters in the city. The mood was quelled on Thursday after the governor turned oversight of the protests over to the state Highway Patrol. State troopers walking side-by-side with thousands of peaceful protesters replaced the image of previous nights: county police in riot gear and armored tanks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the police chief's announcement today was met with immediate disbelief and anger by several dozen community members who also attended the news conference, which was hastily held at a gas station burned during a night of looting earlier in the week in Ferguson, a town of 21,000 that is nearly 70 percent black and patrolled by a nearly all-white police force</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He stopped the wrong one, bottom line,&quot; yelled Tatinisha Wheeler, a nurse's aide who was at the news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple dozen protesters began marching around the charred gas station and in the street chanting, &quot;Hands up, don't shoot,&quot; and, &quot;What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street during a routine patrol. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times, according to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson has told media a different story. He said he and Brown were walking in the street when an officer ordered them onto the sidewalk, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He said Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions in Ferguson boiled over after a candlelight vigil Sunday night, as looters smashed and burned businesses in the neighborhood, where police have repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Thursday, there was a dramatic shift in the atmosphere after Gov. Jay Nixon assigned protest oversight to Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black and grew up near Ferguson. He marched alongside protesters, along with other high-ranking brass from the Highway Patrol and the St. Louis County Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're here to serve and protect,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;We're not here to instill fear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter. When darkness fell   the point at which previous protests have grown tense   no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All they did was look at us and shoot tear gas,&quot; Pedro Smith, who has participated in the nightly protests, said Thursday. &quot;This is totally different. Now we're being treated with respect.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Missouri - The images are reminiscent of a war zone: Helmeted officers pointing weapons from armored trucks, flash grenades lighting the night sky and tear gas exploding in crowded streets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ugly clashes between police and protesters in this Missouri city have fueled a torrent of criticism and raised questions about whether the officers' tactics are inflaming the same violence they aim to suppress after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests escalated late Wednesday into smoky chaos after police lobbed tear gas to repel a crowd of about 150 protesters after some had thrown Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers. It was the fourth straight day of street confrontations spurred by Saturday's fatal shooting of the 18-year-old by a white police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   More than 60 people have been arrested since Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The repeated scenes of police officers wearing military-style camouflage and gas masks and training their rifles on unarmed civilians- some holding their hands up- led critics to condemn the unusual show of force, suggesting it looks more like an Army trying to quell a revolution than a police department trying to keep the peace in Ferguson, a small suburb of St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's clear what is going on in Ferguson is a complete, hyper-exaggerated, hysterical response on the part of law enforcement,&quot; said Thomas Nolan, a former Boston police officer and criminal justice professor of the State University of New York at Plattsburgh. &quot;It's clear that there is no one in charge and no one to corral the officers ... and restrain them from engaging in an unprecedented show of brutal force against civilians. It's horrifying and shameful and a disgrace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Thursday that police are trying to balance the public's right to protest with public safety, including the need to keep streets open. But he added, &quot;If firebombs are being thrown, property gets destroyed, shots get fired ... we have to respond to deadly force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events in Ferguson were seen as part of a growing trend among police departments around the US</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FLORISSANT, Missouri - Missouri state police will take over supervising security from local police in the St. Louis suburb that's been the scene of violent protests since a white police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager, the governor announced Thursday. A new protest with hundreds of people began hours later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama has appealed for &quot;peace and calm&quot; on the streets of Ferguson, the predominantly black city where crowds have gathered to protest since Saturday's shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Jay Nixon announced that state Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black, will take over security after the local police response drew heavy criticism. Nixon said the change is intended to make sure &quot;that we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit and let some of the energy be felt in this region appropriately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said he grew up in the community and &quot;it means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riot police clear demonstrators from a street in Ferguson, Missouri, August 13, 2014. [Photo/Agencies]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday night, some residents were seen looting stores, damaging buildings and vandalizing property. Since then, officers from multiple police departments in riot gear and in military equipment have clashed nightly with protesters, who chant, &quot;Hands up, don't shoot,&quot; a reference to witness accounts that Brown had his hands raised when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have used tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse large crowds, including on Wednesday night when some people threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor faced increasing criticism over suggestions he had not done enough to calm tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early Thursday evening, the tone appeared to be changing. St. Louis County police and state troopers walked alongside demonstrators, and several marchers stopped to shake hands with officers. One woman hugged Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, speaking from the Massachusetts island where he's on a two-week vacation, said there was no excuse for excessive force by police in the aftermath of the shooting. He said he had asked the Justice Department and FBI to investigate the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents in Ferguson have complained about the police response that began soon after Brown's shooting with the use of dogs for crowd control - a tactic that for some evoked civil-rights protests from a half-century ago. The county police force took over, leading both the investigation of Brown's shooting and the subsequent attempts to keep the peace at the smaller city's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, citing threats against that officer and others. The hacker group Anonymous on Thursday released a name purported to be that of the officer, but the Ferguson police chief said later that the name was incorrect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twitter quickly suspended the Anonymous account that posted the officer's purported identity and personal information. The site's code of conduct strictly forbids the publication of private and confidential information without permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer involved was injured, with one side of his face swollen, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told reporters that the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Ferguson, Missouri, fired tear gas, stun grenades and smoke bombs to disperse some 350 protesters late on Wednesday, the fourth night of racially charged demonstrations after police shot to death an unarmed black teen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some demonstrators hurled rocks at police as others scattered, while smoke engulfed the area. A Reuters reporter saw two young men preparing what looked like Molotov cocktails in a bus-stop shelter, their faces covered by bandanas. Police said protesters had thrown gasoline bombs at officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters have gathered every night since Saturday when 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot to death in the mostly black suburb of St. Louis, during what authorities said was a struggle over a gun in a police car. Some witnesses say he was outside the car with his hands up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have deployed camouflage-clad officers in body armor, including one manning a rifle on a tripod atop an armored car, to Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've had enough of being pushed around because of the color of my skin. I'm sick of this police brutality,&quot; said one protester, who gave only his first name, Terrell, 18. &quot;I'm going to keep coming back here night after night until we get justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A St. Louis alderman, Antonio French, was among some 10 people arrested on Wednesday evening, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper reported. About 40 protesters have been arrested since Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the protest swelled on Wednesday night, reporters Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of Huffington Post were briefly arrested at a fast-food restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cloud of tear gas forced Al Jazeera journalists to flee at one point as they prepared for live reporting, with an anchor for the broadcaster Tweeting that police fired the canister at the crew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National figures from President Barack Obama to civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton have called for a peaceful response to the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who is vacationing on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, was briefed on Wednesday night about events in Ferguson by senior advisor Valerie Jarrett and US Attorney General Eric Holder, the White House said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said in a series of Twitter messages he would visit the area on Thursday, and urged &quot;law enforcement to respect rights of residents (and) press&quot; with the hopes that the &quot;ongoing crisis&quot; does not compound Saturday's &quot;tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Situation in Ferguson does not represent who we are. Must keep the peace, while safeguarding rights of citizens and the press,&quot; Nixon wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riot police stand guard on Wednesday as demonstrators protest the shooting death of teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Police fired several rounds of tear gas to disperse protesters, on the fourth night of demonstrations over the fatal shooting of the unarmed black teenager by a police officer on Saturday.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, the American Civil Liberties Union released a report stating that police were overwhelmingly relying on SWAT raids&nbsp;- involving the use of assault rifles, battering rams and flash-bang grenades _ for routine work such as searching for small amounts of drugs and serving warrants. These raids, the ACLU said, disproportionately affected minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In several cases, the paramilitary-style approach led to tragedy, such as a 19-month-old baby critically injured when a flash-bang grenade landed in his crib.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman defended the actions of the officers. &quot;In talking to these guys, it is scary,&quot; he said. &quot;They hear gunshots going off, and they don't know where they're coming from.&quot; He also said coins, bricks and rocks also have been thrown at police. Two officers have been injured. One had an ankle broken by a thrown brick, according to authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson told The Associated Press he was so concerned about the way Ferguson officers have handled the unrest that he pulled his employees out. The city sent a 24-officer tactical squad to help control protesters Sunday and Monday night. The police chief said he was not being critical because he was not there, but the actions taken in Ferguson were not &quot;tactics I would use in the city of St. Louis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Gov. Jay Nixon announced that the Missouri State Highway Patrol would take over supervising security in Ferguson. He said the change was intended to ensure &quot;that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking a breaking from his vacation, President Barack Obama said while &quot;emotions are raw now,&quot; there needs to be a &quot;respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Nick Carey</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri's governor moved to ease tensions on Thursday after days of racially charged protests over the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager, putting the African-American captain of the Highway Patrol in charge of security in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Ron Johnson, who grew up in Ferguson, told reporters he would take a &quot;different approach&quot; to policing after complaints that officers used heavy-handed tactics, arresting dozens of protesters and using teargas and pepper pellets to break up crowds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters filled the streets for a fifth night on Thursday in the mostly black suburb of Ferguson and also assembled in other U.S. cities following the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mood was boisterous but peaceful, even festive at times, in sharp contrast to tense nightly standoffs between heavily armed riot police flanked by armored cars and angry protesters, as well as episodes of looting, vandalism and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of demonstrators, including more white protesters than on previous evenings, gathered late into the night near the site of Saturday's shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sharp contrast to Wednesday night's heavy deployment by riot police, Captain Johnson and a handful of African-American officers without body armor walked among the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We just want to be able to come and demonstrate together without the fear of being shot. It's that simple,&quot; said 53-year-old protester Cat Daniels, an Iraq veteran. &quot;What you see tonight is people coming together. When that kid was killed the hurt and the pain was real.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the forecourt of a gas station burned out during rioting earlier this week, a cowboy rode a horse and a group of children danced on pavement covered in chalk drawings with the words: &quot;Now the world knows your name, RIP Mike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere drivers honked horns and waved signs in solidarity and one group of demonstrators even took to the streets on a car-sized replica of the fictional steam locomotive Thomas The Tank Engine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's because of this young man right here,&quot; Captain Johnson told a CNN reporter, holding up a picture of Brown to shouts of approval from protesters around him. &quot;It's about the justice for everyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests have cast a spotlight on racial tensions in greater St. Louis, where civil rights groups have complained in the past that police racially profiled blacks, arrested a disproportionate number of blacks and had racist hiring practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's shooting galvanized a national moment of silence and rallies in other U.S. cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York, a large crowd briefly overwhelmed a small police presence in Union Square park, forcing officers to scramble to close one of Manhattan's major thoroughfares. Local media showed a handful of protesters being arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In St. Louis, CNN footage showed hundreds of people peacefully assembled in the shadow of the iconic Gateway Arch, Brown's mother and other family members among them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeking to defuse the situation earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama had called on police to respect peaceful demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said Ferguson lately &quot;has looked a little bit more like a war zone, and that is unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have pledged to do better but have also justified the tough tactics, saying they have responded to the threat of violence during protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;WHAT'S HIS NAME?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters have decried what they say is a lack of transparency by police investigating Saturday's shooting, including the refusal to release the officer's name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday night in Ferguson, around 200 demonstrators chanted, &quot;what's his name? what's his name?'&quot; at Johnson and the St. Louis County police chief, Jon Belmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said they plan to release on Friday the name of the officer who shot Brown, according to CNN and Los Angeles Times reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some critics have also called for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCullough to be removed from the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement that police had accepted an offer of technical assistance from the Justice Department &quot;to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department, the FBI and the St. Louis County prosecutor's office are all investigating Brown's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A law enforcement official told Reuters that Holder spoke with Michael Brown's parent's by phone as they and their lawyers visited the U.S. attorney's office in Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder expressed his personal condolences for their son's death and promised the department would conduct a full, independent civil rights investigation, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early on Thursday, a member of the Anonymous hacker activist collective tweeted the name of a person alleged to be the police officer who shot Brown. But police and other Anonymous tweeters said the activist had named the wrong person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little clarity on what occurred during Saturday's incident. Police have said that Brown struggled with the officer who shot and killed him. The officer involved in the shooting was injured during the incident and was treated in a hospital for swelling on the side of his face, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some witnesses have said that Brown held up his hands and was surrendering when he was shot multiple times in the head and chest. (Reporting by Nick Carey; Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee, David Bailey in Minneapolis,</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT Barack Obama called for &quot;a time of healing&quot; yesterday as a sixth night of racially charged protests loomed in Missouri following the death of a black teenager at the hands of police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Obama broke off from his holiday to address the situation in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson, which has been engulfed by demonstrations and violence since the shooting of Michael Brown on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president said: &quot;I know emotions are raw right now. We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old. His family will never hold Michael in their arms again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is never an excuse for violence against police. There is also no excuse for police to use excessive force against protesters. Now is a time for healing. Now is a time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And it's a time for open and transparent process to see justice is done.&quot; According to police, Mr Brown was shot after he and a friend were stopped in the street and he attacked an officer through the patrol car window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Tiffany Mitchell, a witness, said yesterday there had been a &quot;tussle through the window&quot; and Mr Brown seemed to be trying to get away when a shot went off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said: &quot;The kid, he finally gets away and he starts running. As he runs, the police [officer] gets out of his vehicle and he follows behind him shooting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said Mr Brown turned around and put his hands up, but &quot;the cop continued to fire until he just dropped down to the ground and his face just smacks the concrete&quot;. Miss Mitchell said she heard at least &quot;five or six&quot; shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Politicians called for a &quot;demilitarisation&quot; of the situation yesterday as police, armed with Pentagon surplus equipment, faced accusations of heavy-handedness. Officers in camouflage and bullet proof vests have used tear gas, stun grenades and rubber bullets against crowds throwing Molotov cocktails. They also manned automatic weapons atop armoured cars, pointing them at protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protesters likened the police use of dogs for crowd control to methods used during the civil rights protests of half a century ago. One 18-year-old protester said: &quot;I've had enough of being pushed around because of the colour of my skin. I'm sick of this police brutality. I'm going to keep coming back here night after night until we get justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jon Belmar, the St Louis County police chief, defended the tactics, saying officers had faced rocks, bottles and gunfire. Two dozen of their patrol vehicles had been destroyed, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protests were inflamed after police refused to release the name of the officer who shot Mr Brown, saying they did not want to endanger him. The hacker group Anonymous released a purported name for the officer yesterday, but police said it was incorrect. The policeman, who is white, is on administrative leave.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rioters - on the streets after a police officer shot dead an unarmed black teenager - replied with rocks, petrol bombs and chants of Hands up, don't shoot'. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man identified on Twitter as the officer behind the shooting in Missouri was last night in hiding - though it later emerged blundering hackers had named the wrong man. President Obama interrupted his holiday to speak out about the clashes in Ferguson, a suburb 12 miles north of the city of St Louis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When something like this happens, the authorities, including the police, have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that deaths.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence follows the death of black teenager Michael Brown last Saturday. Friends claim he had his arms in the air when he was shot several times. However, officials in Ferguson said the 18-year-old was involved in struggle for a police gun and an officer was wounded in the face in the scuffle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far more than 20 shops have been looted and dozens of arrests made. Witnesses say largely peaceful protests during daylight hours have turned into rioting as the police try to enforce an evening curfew.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Online activists Anonymous hacked into the town's computer system and named an officer as the man who shot Mr Brown. Other Twitter users then began making death threats.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SALT LAKE CITY - A contrast to gunshots and Molotov cocktails in Ferguson, Missouri, a group at Salt Lake Community College sat silently Thursday, red bands tied around their arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 50 protesters sang &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; before falling quiet at 5:20 p.m., joining a national moment of silence for an 18-year-old shot and killed by police in St. Louis on Saturday that has sparked long days of protests and violent nights between demonstrators and police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the group outside the SLCC student center were family members of two Utah men killed by law enforcement in Utah - Siale Angilau, 25, shot by a federal marshal as he charged at a witness in court, and Dillon Taylor, 20, shot in a confrontation with police outside a South Salt Lake convenience store. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest was one of dozens across the country calling for a &quot;national moment of silence&quot; as rioters and peaceful protesters alike have clashed with police in Ferguson, Missouri, the violent fallout after the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old African-American man from the St. Louis neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few details have been released by police about Brown's death. Police have called the shooting a result of a dangerous confrontation with Brown, while witnesses contend the 18-year-old was fleeing when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, three Salt Lake police officers have been placed on leave as Taylor's shooting is investigated. Police have not released whether Taylor was armed when he was killed. Family members say he wasn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor's brother, Jerrail Taylor, accompanied friends and family members as they joined the vigil. He was with his brother Monday night when he was shot and claims the limited information investigators have shared about the shooting doesn't match up with what he saw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm confused. They said he was angry,&quot; Jerrail Taylor said. &quot;He didn't seem upset to me. He just pulled up his pants. ... He followed the orders, and they still shot him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerrail Taylor claims officers investigating the shooting have failed to provide his family with a name and badge number of the officer involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alasdair Ekpenyong, who helped organize the event, told the crowd that Monday's silent protest united voices across the country and offered a chance for those concerned by officer-involved shootings in the U.S. to ask questions and share their feelings without fear of reprimand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not meant to be critical of police,&quot; he told the crowd. &quot;Police, when they act properly, provide a valuable service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Ekpenyong spoke out about local shootings like that of Dillon Taylor, asking the crowd to raise their hands if they had heard about it. He believes force used by police in Utah and around the country needs to be checked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The solution is going to involve communities everywhere, including in Utah, talking about the fact that it happens in our cities, it happens in Missouri, it happens in New York, it happens in Salt Lake City, and it needs to be stopped,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama called for calm on all sides in an address Thursday morning, saying there is &quot;no excuse&quot; for use of excessive force by officers against protesters. On the other hand, Obama decried violence against police as well as looting and criminal activity in the aftermath of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president likewise criticized the arrest of two journalists covering the mayhem in Missouri, a fact that Ekpenyong called troubling. The reporters were later released with no charges filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said Thursday that following shootings like the one that killed Brown, law enforcement has a responsibility to be &quot;open and transparent&quot; through their investigations. The Ferguson Police Department has not released the name of the officer who pulled the trigger, citing threats and safety concerns.</SPAN></P>

Amy DeBeck held a vigil Thursday evening, Aug. 14, at the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Elkhart to reflect on the events in Ferguson, Mo. DeBeck spoke about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager killed by police and the days of police response and arrests of journalists that have followed. Some congregants reflected on how current events remind them of the 1960s and the protests and police actions they lived through. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DeBeck gave participants a chance to voice their thoughts, then offered a prayer for the families, officers and citizens of Ferguson, as congregants lit candles for their vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For all of this fear, may there be a candle somewhere that rekindles the warmth and love in their hearts, and reminds them that love is stronger than fear,&quot; she offered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot do nothing as our neighbors in Missouri experience what happens in a police state,&quot; the church posted on Facebook on Thursday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vigil will be led the Rev. Amy Kulesza DeBeck in the church sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests have been ongoing in the St. Louis suburb since Saturday, Aug. 9, when a white police officer shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, to death, the Associated Press reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tension and violence came to a head Wednesday night, with some protesters throwing Molotov cocktails and other objects at police, who retaliated with smoke bombs, tear gas, pepperballs, rubber bullets and stun grenades, MSNBC reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 16 people were arrested Wednesday, including two journalists and a local politician, according to MSNBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a statement on the events Thursday afternoon, President Barack Obama criticized both sides involved in the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,&quot; he said. &quot;There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also criticized police for the arrests of journalists &quot;who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 15--HOPEFULLY, the racial tensions that erupted in the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting in a St. Louis suburb will ease soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, the underlying causes of incidents like this one, in which a Ferguson, Mo., police officer is accused of shooting and killing the 18-year-old Brown last Saturday, remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some years ago, I wrote a column in which I said that a police officer's badge had become a license to kill. I hold to that statement, mainly because the problem seems worse today than it was then. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the shooting of this unarmed teenager outside of St. Louis to the fatal chokehold initiated by an officer in New York, seldom does a week go by that there is not a story in the media about cops using unnecessary force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It used to be that it was the victim's or some bystander's word against that of the officer. But in this day and age of cellphone video cameras, the evidence is often undeniable, and it's visible right there on TV or the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of Michael Brown, the police say that, following some sort of confrontation, he and another young person struggled for the police officer's gun in a patrol car. An eyewitness, however, stated on national television that Brown was away from the car, had turned and had his hands in the air when fatally shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key here may be the word &quot;confrontation.&quot; Police officers too often seem to inflame a situation rather than calm things down. I have personally seen it happen a number of times. Inflammation then leads to confrontation, which leads to violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Maryland, for example, an argument over a bus fare led to a confrontation with a police officer and the eventual death of the person arrested. Did the situation need to go that far? Or in such a violent direction?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that some police officers consider everyone guilty--of something--until proven otherwise. That's not the way it is supposed to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinary citizens have a problem with all this because we turn on the nightly news and see the people we are paying to protect us choking a man in New York or beating a woman senseless on a highway in California. And neither person, according to reports, had any kind of a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though allegations of police brutality are now popping up regularly, the media often does not want to point a finger of blame. To do so would be politically incorrect. Again, we don't know how to react when those we pay to protect us become judge, jury and sometimes executioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, too, the images we often see are of white cops beating black suspects. No one wants to touch that aspect of the problem either. That's too sensitive a subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the problem is there. The cameras don't lie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this said, there is another aspect of the Michael Brown situation that needs discussing--the rioting and looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In front of cameras, rioters used Brown's death as an excuse to break into stores and steal whatever they could. One tire dealer reported almost a quarter of a million dollars in stolen merchandise and damaged property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can understand anger and protests, but looting and stealing in the name of a dead man is inexcusable. And, from the reports I read, race was not a factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rioters seemed indiscriminate in their looting, hitting businesses owned by both whites and blacks, as well as other minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, they were stealing--no matter from whom--just because they felt they could get away with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I have said many times, maybe America needs to clean up its own mess before we start telling the rest of the world how to live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One look at the Michael Brown incident that ravaged a St. Louis suburb indicates that we still have plenty of problems here at home that need solving.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri is known in American folklore as the &quot;show-me state,&quot; a shorthand to describe a people who take nothing on faith but instead insist that those making assertions must &quot;show me&quot; the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right now the &quot;show-me state&quot; is showing an ugly face to the world, which might be why, on Thursday, the state's Democratic governor, Jay Nixon, cancelled a visit to the State Fair and hurried to Ferguson, the site of anger and violence following the slaying of an unarmed black teenager by a local police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama chimed in with an appeal for &quot;peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.&quot; Until then, the sound you hardly heard amid the tumult in the troubled suburb of St. Louis was the drone of political figures raising their voices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was plenty of other noise coming from that embattled part of the state, and most of it expressed the deep despair of a community convulsed in rage. We know the name of the young man (Michael Brown) but until a hacker group said it unearthed the information, we had no clue of the name of the police officer who killed him and who now is on leave from the force. That, plus the appearance of gun-toting police in military kit, only inflamed an incendiary situation that already included looting and vandalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until President Obama spoke up Thursday from his holiday retreat to deplore the use of force in Ferguson and call for an investigation, there had been only the (perfunctory) politicians' expressions of concern and appeals for calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only now, as the upheaval approaches its sixth day, are there constructive words being uttered and gestures made in response to one of those signature American episodes that train the eye, and the conscience, to the country's troubled legacy of racial strife. Some came from two potential Republican presidential candidates, Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. Mr. Paul, in an essay for the Time website, said the &quot;outrage in Ferguson is understandable&quot; and added: &quot;If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn't have expected to be shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Ferguson, with its farmers' market and its seven-month &quot;citywalk&quot; concert series, might on the surface be a symbol of racial integration - about 6,000 whites living amid about 14,000 blacks - there are tensions beneath that surface, with blacks disproportionately targeted by police, according to a 2013 state study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, now the city is emerging as a symbol of discord and tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is larger symbolism involved. Missouri entered the Union as part of a landmark 1820 compromise that approved the admission of the state, which permitted slavery, into the country as part of a balancing act that also approved the admission of Maine, a free state. Missouri played a role in the Dred Scott case of 1857 that was one of the preludes to the Civil War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two-thirds of a century ago, the great American writer John Gunther wrote a landmark book about the United States called Inside U.S.A. and the second sentence of his chapter on Missouri reads this way: &quot;Here ... you will find almost every American problem in peppery miniature.&quot; This week's crisis only underscores that truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama was briefed on the situation at his holiday hideaway off the Massachusetts coast and through Thursday morning had only issued a relatively bland statement, calling for Americans to &quot;comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.&quot; But the White House, sensitive about the prominence of the President's attendance at a Martha's Vineyard social event while Ferguson was in upheaval, moved Thursday to take a higher profile as events unfolded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, was broadly criticized for a &quot;fly-over&quot; visit to the Southern areas ravaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 - an act he later described as a &quot;huge mistake.&quot; But in fairness to Mr. Bush, and to Mr. Obama, both presidents have wondered whether high-profile journeys to crisis areas designed to offer comfort instead only serve to distract emergency personnel's attention from their work to ameliorate those calamities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right now many American politicians are, like the President, on vacation. This week's events are a reminder that in the United States racial tension seldom takes a holiday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama attempted yesterday to defuse the escalating standoff in Missouri between protesters and police after an officer shot dead an unarmed teenager at the weekend, calling for calm and stressing that there was no excuse for excessive force by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a fourth night of confrontation on the streets of Ferguson over the death of Michael Brown on Saturday, the US president said he regretted loss of life, deplored the arrest of journalists covering the flashpoint and urged a state of peace. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We lost a young man in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances,&quot; Obama said of Brown. &quot;He was 18 years old, his family will never hold (him) in their arms again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there was no excuse for violence against police, but equally there was &quot;no excuse for police to use excessive force&quot; in their response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appealing for calm, he said: &quot;Now's the time for healing, now's the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also condemned the arrests of reporters. &quot;Here in the United States of America police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments came amid growing confrontation in Ferguson, where residents of the majority black town of 21,000 people have been protesting against the killing of Brown by an officer from the overwhelmingly white police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response to the protest had been led by the St Louis County police force, which has deployed snipers, as well as armoured vehicles and officers in military combat gear to quell protests on successive evenings since Brown's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two reporters, from the Washington Post and the Huffington Post, were arrested on Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marty Baron, the editor of the Washington Post, condemned the arrest as &quot;an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday the governor of Missouri stood down the police force from leading the response to the demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Nixon handed responsibility for law and order to the Missouri state highway patrol, led by an African American captain raised in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all have been concerned about the vision that the world has seen,&quot; Nixon said. Promising a &quot;softer front&quot;, he said that a new command would ensure that &quot;we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronald Johnson, captain of the highway patrol, signalled a different tone. He told reporters: &quot;Before I came here today, I had all my troopers take their teargas masks off their belts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon said that St Louis County police, although removed from the front line, would continue to lead the investigation into Brown's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senior US senator for Missouri, Claire McCaskill, said she had been working to &quot;demilitarise&quot; the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said yesterday: &quot;This kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution. I obviously respect law enforcement's work to provide public safety, but my constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests, and the police need to respect that right and protect that right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is going to be a new start, we can and need to do better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters took to the streets after Brown was shot dead by police on Saturday afternoon. The police have refused to release the name of the officer involved in the shooting, citing concerns for that person's safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday night the heavily armed police force fired teargas and rubber bullets to force hundreds of protesters out of the centre of town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of officers, some carrying assault rifles, advanced with a pair of armoured trucks on the young and predominantly African American crowd in Ferguson, after two glass bottles were thrown at their lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man, who had his arms aloft in the &quot;hands up - don't shoot&quot; gesture that has come to define these protests, was shot several times. After he fell to the ground, he was pounced upon by several officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They hit me on the hand with a teargas bomb,&quot; said Tony Giegers, 27. &quot;It exploded on me, kind of like buckshot. It sprayed everywhere. It hit me there on my hand and burned my hand. It's burning right now, it's burning up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A highly visible camera crew for the television channel al-Jazeera America, who were reporting on the clashes, said that they, too, were shot at with rubber bullets. The Guardian watched as a gas canister was fired directly at them as they attempted to record a piece to camera. The crew and their presenter fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police are responding with force, which you can understand to a certain degree,&quot; said Justin, a 29-year-old protester. &quot;But this amount of force was unwarranted. This is an abuse of force. No one is firing guns at them or running at them. This is an overreach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Were people yelling at them? Were people shouting obscenities? Yes, that's normal. But no one rioted, no one looted, no one threatened harm. This is getting out of control. It's like a military action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said that Saturday's shooting followed an assault on the officer. But a friend who was walking with Brown said that the 18-year-old had been grabbed after declining a request to get on to the pavement. He was then shot repeatedly as he tried to run away.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the family of Michael Brown, the 18-year-old unarmed African-American youth who was gunned down by a police officer in the state of Missouri last Saturday, grapple with his death, the incident has again initiated uncomfortable questions about the status and plight of African-Americans in US society. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's bereaved family are looking for answers. The police have confirmed that they too are looking for intentions that sparked this controversy. In doing so, they may have committed a procedural lapse, in the eyes of the public, by not naming the officer who shot the boy. This strengthens the racial argument for the residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By all accounts, the officer was white. The town of Ferguson, where the incident took place, has undergone a dramatic demographic shift from a majority of white residents to mostly black residents. The population of the town is two-thirds black. The local police force is made up of 53 officers, three of whom are black. Clearly, the question of inclusivity will raise its head. Brown was also unarmed -- another component in the problem that could cause the establishment to squirm while they try to come up with plausible arguments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial divisions have widened. The violence must stop. There must also be a quick and effective probe into the incident. More importantly, however, those who uphold the law must be seen to be doing and saying the right thing when dealing with such a sensitive issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">957 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. County police in riot gear and armoured tanks gave way to state troopers walking side-by-side with thousands of protesters as the St. Louis suburb where an unarmed black teen was shot by a city police officer overwhelmingly avoided violence Thursday after nearly a week of unrest and mounting public tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dramatic shift came after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon assigned oversight of the protests to the state Highway Patrol, stripping local police from the St. Louis County Police Department of their authority after four days of clashes with furious crowds protesting the weekend death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All they did was look at us and shoot tear gas,&quot; said Pedro Smith, 41, who has participated in the nightly protests. &quot;This is totally different. Now we're being treated with respect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more tolerant response came as President Barack Obama spoke publicly for the first time about Saturday's fatal shooting - and the subsequent violence that shocked the nation and threatened to tear apart Ferguson, a town of 21,000 that is nearly 70 per cent black and patrolled by a nearly all-white police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said there was &quot;no excuse&quot; for violence either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon's promise to ease the deep racial tensions was swiftly put to the test as demonstrators gathered again Thursday evening in the neighbourhood where looters had smashed and burned businesses on Sunday and where police had repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the latest protests had a light, almost jubilant atmosphere among the racially mixed crowd, more akin to a parade or block party. The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter. When darkness fell -the point at which previous protests have grown tense - no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can feel it. You can see it,&quot; protester Cleo Willis said of the change. &quot;Now it's up to us to ride that feeling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon appointed Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black, to lead the police effort. Johnson, who grew up near Ferguson and commands a region that includes St. Louis County, marched alongside protesters Thursday, joined by other high-ranking brass from the Highway Patrol as well as the county department. The marchers also had a police escort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're here to serve and protect,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;We're not here to instil fear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several people stopped to shake hands and even hug Johnson and other officers, thanking them by name. At one point, Johnson spoke to several young men wearing red bandanas around their necks and faces. After the discussion, one of the men reached out and embraced him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the QuikTrip, children drew on the ground with chalk and people left messages about Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama had appealed for &quot;peace and calm&quot; on the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,&quot; Obama said. &quot;But let's remember that we're all part of one American family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents in Ferguson have complained about the police response that began soon after Brown's shooting with the use of dogs for crowd control - a tactic that for some evoked civil-rights protests from a half-century ago. The county police had taken over the investigation of Brown's shooting and security at the request of the smaller city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon vowed that &quot;Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it.&quot; The governor was joined at a news conference by the white mayor of St. Louis and the region's four state representatives and the county executive, all of whom are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city and county remain under criticism, though, for refusing to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, citing threats against that officer and others. The hacker group Anonymous on Thursday released a name purported to be that of the officer, but the Ferguson police chief said the name was incorrect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, social media brought international attention to the tragedy. Ferguson spawned a proliferation of hashtags and has been a dominant subject on Twitter, Facebook and other sites. Journalists and protesters offered real-time pictures, videos and updates, and the world responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown, has told a much different story. He has said the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric Holder has said federal investigators have interviewed witnesses to the shooting. A person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, said federal authorities have interviewed Johnson. Holder spoke by telephone Thursday with Brown's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In St. Louis, Brown's mother appeared briefly Thursday night at an anti-brutality gathering near the city's Gateway Arch, urging through a relative for peace to prevail. The observance was among many staged nationwide, each with a minute of silence for Brown and others affected by alleged police brutality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson this morning identified Darren Wilson as the officer who shot and killed an unarmed teenager last Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson is a 6-year veteran of the force. He was placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, 18, was shot multiple times Saturday afternoon in the 2900 block of Canfield Drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2014 graduate of Normandy High School was due to start classes at Vatterott College on Monday. His mother, Lesley McSpadden, said her son was walking to his grandmother's when he was gunned down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His death prompted almost immediate protests in Ferguson, including Sunday night demonstrations that led to rioting and looting. Protesters looted and then set fire to a QuikTrip store and vandalized others in the area near where Brown was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrations and protests escalated, reaching a climax on Wednesday night when St. Louis County officers in full riot gear responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and armored vehicles. About a dozen people were arrested, including two national reporters and a St. Louis alderman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That led to Thursday's change in direction -when Gov. Jay Nixon put the Missouri Highway Patrol in charge of the security in Ferguson and removed St. Louis County police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change was dramatic and immediate, as Thursday night's police presence lacked gas masks, smoke bombs and military gear. Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, the patrol officer put in charge, walked and talked with protesters, exchanging hugs and answering questions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Images of police outfitted in paramilitary gear clashing with protesters in suburban St. Louis after the weekend shooting death of an unarmed black teenager are giving new impetus to efforts to rein in a Pentagon program that provides free machine-guns and other surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson says he plans to introduce legislation when Congress returns in September to curb what he describes as an increasing militarization of police agencies across the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our Main Streets should be a place for business, families and relaxation, not tanks and M16s,&quot; Johnson said Thursday. &quot;Militarizing America's Main Streets won't make us any safer, just more fearful and more reticent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric Holder said he's concerned that use of military equipment by police in Ferguson, Missouri, is sending a &quot;conflicting message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder said authorities there have accepted the Justice Department's offer of crowd-control help as it continues to investigate the Saturday shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response by law enforcement to protests &quot;must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them,&quot; Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Defence Logistics Agency, the government's combat logistics support agency, said the Ferguson Police Department has been part of the surplus equipment program. It received two tactical vehicles - both Humvees - as well as a generator and a trailer and may have received other equipment, DLA spokesman Joe Yoswa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI and Justice Department are conducting a civil rights investigation into the shooting. Eyewitnesses have already been interviewed, Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to demilitarize this situation_this kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution,&quot; said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who was in Ferguson on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said his bill would limit the kinds of military equipment that can be transferred to local law enforcement agencies and require states to certify they can account for all equipment received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he is disturbed by reports that some weapons and other equipment distributed to police agencies have gone missing. He also expressed concern that the trend toward militarizing has moved beyond local police departments and sheriff's offices, saying Ohio State University recently acquired a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle, or MRAP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, college kids are getting too rowdy,&quot; Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Sen. Rand Paul blamed the trend on the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There should be a difference between a police response and a military response&quot; to street protests, Paul, a possible Republican presidential contender in 2016, wrote in an opinion column in Time magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies - where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement,&quot; Paul wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, cites a 24-year-old program that lets local police agencies acquire for free surplus military equipment ranging from blankets and bayonets to tanks. An Associated Press investigation last year found that a large share of the $4.2 billion in surplus military gear distributed by the program since 1990 went to police and sheriff's departments in rural areas with few officers and little crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, defended the program as useful because &quot;it allows for the reuse of military equipment that otherwise would be disposed of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether events in Missouri had given the Pentagon reason to reconsider the program, Kirby said, &quot;It is up to law enforcement agencies to speak to how and what they gain through this system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Republican House Speaker John Boehner declined to comment on Johnson's proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement about the shooting, Boehner said he supports &quot;a full and thorough investigation&quot; of the events surrounding Brown's death, as well as subsequent actions, including the detention of journalists covering the protests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. - Police on Friday identified the officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager in a St. Louis suburb and released documents alleging the young man had been suspected of stealing a $48.99 box of cigars from a convenience store in a &quot;strong-arm&quot; robbery shortly before he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know the teen was a robbery suspect at the time of the shooting and stopped Michael Brown and a companion &quot;because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darren Wilson, 28, has been an officer in suburban St. Louis for six years and had no complaints filed against him, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's death ignited four days of clashes with furious protesters. The tension eased Thursday after the governor turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Within hours, the mood on the street lighted, with state troopers walking side-by-side with peaceful protesters and no hint of violence. Gone were the police in riot gear and armoured vehicles, pointing assault rifles at protesters and firing tear gas into crowds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's relatives immediately questioned whether the officer really believed Brown was a suspect and said no robbery would justify shooting the teen after he put his hands up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family's attorney, Benjamin Crump, said Brown's parents were blindsided by the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's bad enough they assassinated him, and now they're trying to assassinate his character,&quot; Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An attorney for the teen who was with Brown on the day of the shooting said his client has acknowledged to investigators that Brown took cigars from the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson has been on administrative leave since the Aug. 9 shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson described Wilson as &quot;a gentle, quiet man&quot; who had been &quot;an excellent officer.&quot; He's been on the Ferguson force for four years. Prior to that, he patrolled in the neighbouring community of Jennings, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 11:51 a.m. on the day of the shooting, police records show, authorities received a call reporting a robbery at the Ferguson Market. An unidentified officer was dispatched to the store, arriving within three minutes. The officer interviewed an employee and customer, who gave a description of a man who stole the cigars and walked off with another man toward another store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Descriptions of the suspect were broadcast over the police radio. The officer did not find the suspects either on the street or at the other store, the reports said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The robber took a box of Swisher Sweets Cigars valued at $48.99, according to the reports. The suspects were identified as 18-year-old Michael Brown and 22-year-old Dorian Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, Wilson had been responding to a nearby call involving a sick 2-month child from 11:48 am until noon, when he left that place. A minute later, he encountered Michael Brown walking down a street. The documents contained no description of what happened between Brown and Wilson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump noted that police did not release a photo of the officer but released images from the store's security video that they say show Brown grabbing a man inside the store. Crump said he had not seen the photos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police &quot;are choosing to disseminate information that is very strategic to try to help them justify the execution-style&quot; killing, said Crump, who also represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the teenager fatally shot by a Florida neighbourhood watch organizer who was later acquitted of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Aug. 9 video appears to show a man wearing a ball cap, shorts and white T-shirt grabbing a much shorter man by his shirt near the store's door. A police report alleges that Brown grabbed the man who had come from behind the store counter and &quot;forcefully pushed him back&quot; into a display rack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson, Brown's friend, told investigators that Brown &quot;did take cigarillos,&quot; his attorney, Freeman Bosley, told MSNBC. Bosley said he was aware of video but had not seen it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have determined that Johnson was not involved in the robbery and will not seek charges against him, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's uncle, Bernard Ewing, had questioned whether Wilson really believed Brown was a suspect. He referred to Johnson's account that the officer's only command to the two young men was to get out of the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A robbery &quot;still doesn't justify shooting him when he puts his hands up,&quot; he added. &quot;You still don't shoot him in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sidebar:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is more than one St. Louis-area police officer named Darren Wilson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson on Friday identified the officer involved in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager as Darren Wilson, a six-year veteran of the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's more than one Darren Wilson who works in St. Louis-area law enforcement, however - and if you Googled &quot;Darren Wilson police&quot; immediately after the name was released, there's a good chance you found the wrong guy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darren Wilson - a sergeant with the St. Louis Police Department and president of the Ethical Society of Police - is NOT the Darren Wilson who shot and killed Michael Brown, an 18-year-old whose death has sparked protests in Ferguson, Mo. That's according to a statement posted on Facebook shortly after the news conference in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first thing we would like to assure the world is that this is a horrific coincidence,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;May I assure the world that this is not the President of the Ethical Society of Police's Sergeant Darren R. Wilson who is African American, and happens to be an 18 year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethical Society of Police is a group that &quot;represents African-American police officers,&quot; according to a 2013 St. Louis Post-Dispatch story, which now carries an editor's note to clarify Wilson's identity in the piece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emails and messages left with Wilson, the St. Louis police sergeant, were not immediately returned Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least two names floated around the Internet prior to Friday's news conference - and on Thursday, the hacking group Anonymous tried to ID the officer involved. But the name it released was wrong, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USA Today spoke with the stepmother of the man whose name Anonymous had connected to the Brown shooting. She told the paper that he was a dispatcher in a St. Louis suburb, not a police officer in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow, this is not good,&quot; the woman reportedly said, as she cried.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I've watched, like millions of others, the tensions in Ferguson,  Mo., escalate, I can't help but think back to my childhood in the  1960s watching American cities burn due to race riots while  National Guard troops were fitted out in heavy combat gear, ready  for war. The great irony being, of course, that America was already  at war, and up to its neck in it, on the other side of the world in  Vietnam.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    For those of us who grew up watching Presidents Kennedy, Johnson  and Nixon deliver similar addresses, President Obama's press  briefing Thursday from Massachusetts about Ferguson and also about  the U.S. military involvement in Iraq felt more than a little like  d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama cited progress in Iraq, where the U.S. military efforts are  meant to save fleeing Yazidi refugees from the onslaught of the  rejuvenated militant jihadist juggernaut known as the Islamic  State, and also bring some stability to a country torn by war -- a  country this nation occupied, at great cost, for nearly a decade.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The president also called for calm in Ferguson, where it seems a  community is on the verge of exploding over the still unexplained  shooting of Michael Brown, a black teen-ager, by a police officer  last Saturday afternoon.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    As Slate.com's Jamelle Bouie writes about the situation playing out  in Ferguson, &quot;Image after image shows officers clad in Kevlar  vests, helmets, and camouflage, armed with pistols, shotguns,  automatic rifles, and tear gas.&quot; There is no need to call out the  National Guard when the everyday police look as though they are  armed up enough to storm a hill in Kandahar Province.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Community                     on the edge  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    It doesn't take much to imagine this Ferguson stand-off spinning  out of control in a very ugly way. Certainly, there is pressure on  people in uniform to maintain order and also to keep their cool,  show restraint. Let me say I would not want their job.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Yet it is also easy to see why the African-American community in  Ferguson is on edge, as urban communities across this country are  all too often on edge, given the often heavy police presence, but  also a seeming lack of governmental concern regarding other  matters, such as jobs and child care.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Generally speaking, the black people in Ferguson want answers, and  they are being given few. Rioting and property destruction is not  the way to go, but no doubt many feel that protest -- an act so  very engrained in America's identity -- is the only recourse.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Indeed, it is difficult for me to understand how Obama can utter  the words &quot;now is a time for healing&quot; and &quot;now is a time for peace  and calm on the streets of Ferguson,&quot; when folks in that town have  heretofore been treated with all the delicacy, say, of a vanquished  people by an invading force that is armed to the teeth.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Longtime                           racial wounds  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    It's hard for me to see how the gathering rage enveloping Ferguson  is going to be soothed as long as policing authorities are  outwardly showing such a militant-like stance when the very  incident that lit the fuse on this fire must have a lot to do with  deep-seated distrust in some neighborhoods between the police and  the people living on the streets they patrol.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Longtime racial wounds have never fully healed in this country.  That's no secret to anyone willing to open their eyes. The scabs  are too easily pulled off, especially when an unarmed Trayvon  Martin is shot by a neighborhood watch resident in Florida, for  reasons still unclear, and when another black teenager, Michael  Brown, is shot and killed by police, once more, for reasons  unclear.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Whatever explanation for the Brown shooting may yet be revealed,  when local police dress like characters in a 'Call of Duty&quot; video  game, and become belligerent with two journalists merely sitting  inside a McDonald's trying to do their jobs, it tells you a lot  about the mindset. Had I not been given a setup before watching the  video of the confrontation between police and the Washington Post's  Wesley Lowery (no relation) Wednesday night, I would have thought  surely this is a member of some military group, in some other  country, moving to stifle a member of the press.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Yet just like in the '60s, that journalist was an American. And the  person doing the confronting was no military-trained, special-ops  recruit, but a member of the local police department. Yes, at this  point in time, I'd say we all have good reason to be afraid.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State and national leaders scrambled yesterday to show they are sensitive to the grievances of African-Americans in urban communities like Ferguson near St Louis, which has seen successive nights of tumult and confrontation in the wake of a shooting of a black teenager by a white police officer last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Footage of the chaos on the streets of Ferguson has dominated newscasts, yet attempts to ease tensions have faltered as local police commanders have chosen to deploy overwhelming force to repel protesters and have declined to release the identity of the officer who opened fire on 18-year-old Michael Brown, days before he was to start college. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images we have seen,&quot; President Barack Obama said, reiterating that he had ordered the FBI and the Justice Department to independently investigate the shooting of Mr Brown. The President broke from his holiday on Martha's Vineyard to address the ongoing violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, told a meeting of residents that &quot;you will all see a different tone&quot; in the police response, after announcing unspecified &quot;operational shifts&quot; in law enforcement tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the exact circumstances of the shooting remain in dispute and may not be officially determined for weeks, his death has become the latest symbol of the simmering racial frustration that still infects American society, 50 years after the Civil Rights Act and six years after Mr Obama became the first black president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, told a meeting in Ferguson that she was seeking a &quot;demilitarisation&quot; of the police response to the protests. Armoured vehicles and non-lethal ammunition such as stun grenades have been deployed, turning an American suburb into what has looked like a war zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St Louis County police department, defended the use of tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse crowds on Wednesday night, which also saw the brief detention of two reporters for videotaping the events. They were released without charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In talking to these guys, it is scary,&quot; Mr Schellman said of officers on the front lines of the protest. &quot;They hear gunshots going off, and they don't know where they're coming from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama said there was no excuse for vandalism or unwarranted attacks against the police, but added pointedly that there was &quot;also no excuse for police to use excessive force against citizens&quot; engaged in legitimate protests. He also took direct aim at whoever arrested the two reporters, working for the Washington Post and the website Huffington Post. Police &quot;should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are trying to do their jobs,&quot; he declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Ferguson is the latest flashpoint in America's struggle to overcome a legacy of racial tension going back to slavery, it could just as easily have been somewhere else; Los Angeles, where 24-year-old Ezell Ford, also black, was shot and killed by a police officer on Monday, or perhaps New York, where the death of Eric Garner while in custody, after an officer held him in an illegal chokehold last month, is still fuelling anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grievances still felt by many African-Americans are rooted in the life experiences of many of them, particularly young men, which are also reflected in the sometimes shocking statistics. Statistics from Ferguson are startling but by no means unique to the town, which, on the edge of downtown St Louis, became majority black after whites fled decades ago to escape rising violence and sinking schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until last weekend, few beyond Ferguson will have known that only three of its 53 police officers are black, even if the community is overwhelmingly more black than white. Or that 483 blacks were arrested in town last year but only 36 whites. Or that blacks, who make up less than two thirds of the driving-age population, account for 86 per cent of all traffic stops by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, similar instances of unequal lives abound. Median income levels for African-Americans remain about two thirds of what they are for whites, and black unemployment is twice as high. These are disparities that are not always ignored, of course. Hence a current campaign to change sentencing rules for narcotics crimes and enable early release for drug offenders, to try to reduce madly elevated rates of incarceration for black males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But progress can be offset by reverse steps. A campaign inside the white half of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, known as St George, to secede from the rest of the city has widely been condemned, for instance, as a barely disguised return to segregation, where whites will get the best schools and blacks will be left out. A Supreme Court ruling last year gutting the 1965 Voting Rights Act has also been deplored as a betrayal of the civil rights movement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawyer said Thursday that he plans to file a wrongful death suit on behalf of the family of a black man who was fatally shot by two Los Angeles Police Department officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police, in a preliminary account, said a man, whom family and the attorney identified as 25-year-old  mentally challenged  Ezell Ford was shot about 8:10 p.m. Monday in South Los Angeles after he grabbed an officer and attempted to remove a gun from his holster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe the contact with my client s son unnecessarily led to an out-of-policy shooting, which is excessive force and forms the basis of a wrongful death claim ... pursuant to the basic civil rights statute,  said attorney Steven A. Lerman, who represented Rodney King. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday evening, hundreds turned out for a march along Broadway to demonstrate outrage over the shooting. Although tensions were high, with many expressing anger with police, the march remained peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators, carrying signs   many with  Don t shoot  written on them   and chanting  Justice for Ezell Ford. Justice for Michael Brown,  started at the scene of Monday s shooting on 65th Street, just east of Broadway, and headed to LAPD s 77th Street station and back, with LAPD blocking vehicles on Broadway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar demonstrations were held throughout the country to protest police killings, including that of Brown, an unarmed teen police fatally shot in Ferguson, Mo., with #NMOS14 , or National Moment of Silence 2014, being used on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Newton Area Gang Enforcement officers were driving westbound on 65th Street near Broadway when they came upon the man identified as Ford as he was walking on a sidewalk. When the officers attempted to stop him for unknown reasons, he turned, grabbed one of the officers and a struggle ensued, according to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After they fell to the ground and the man attempted to remove the officer s handgun from its holster, the officer s partner shot him  believing there was an imminent threat of danger  and then the officer on the ground  fired  his backup weapon, LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man who said he was Ezell Ford s brother said his brother  didn t deserve this.  He declined to comment further and wouldn t give his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the march, demonstrators lit candles and observed a moment of silence to honor Ford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lerman, who plans to file the wrongful death suit in federal court in the coming week, called the confrontation deadly and violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I can t see why a taser couldn t have been used or a bean bag gun, which the officers are equipped with,  he said.  I believe the officers knew this individual and knew he had mental problems. I believe that alone should have made them more aware of how to treat him properly so he doesn t end up dead on a sidewalk right by his house. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the medical record and witnesses in the neighborhood will attest that Ford was receiving medication for some mental issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lerman said he s hiring an investigative team made up of former law enforcement and FBI officials to probe the matter and to  offer proof in federal court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man, Leroy Hill, told the Huffington Post that he witnessed the incident. He said the officers were beating Ford and he didn t know why because  he didn t do nothing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident is being investigated by the LAPD s Force Investigation Division, with the inspector general and the district attorney monitoring the probe and ensuring it is complete and unbiased, said Tyler Izen, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If a suspect s behavior is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death, an officer can, by law and under LAPD policy, use deadly force,  Izen said in a statement.  In using deadly force, officers can fire their weapons only to stop deadly threats to keep themselves and the public safe, and can continue to fire until the threat has ended. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAPD is asking for any witnesses, including those who may have physical evidence such as video, to contact the department or the Office of the Inspector General. LAPD investigators have asked that the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner place an investigative hold on the pending autopsy report, according to a statement released Thursday night.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama said Thursday that he wanted an open and transparent investigation into the shooting death of an unarmed 18-year-old black man by the police on Saturday in a St. Louis suburb. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expressing concern over the ''violent turn'' of events in this St. Louis suburb, President Obama said Thursday that he wanted an open and transparent investigation into the shooting death of an unarmed 18-year-old black man by police on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on Martha's Vineyard, the Massachusetts island where he is on vacation, Mr. Obama said there was no excuse for any use of excessive force by the police in responding to the unrest that has played out over the five days since the man, Michael Brown, was shot while walking with a friend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Now's the time for healing,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Now's the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said he had called Missouri's governor, Jay Nixon, expressing concern about the violence on the street and the police response. Mr. Nixon said Mr. Obama had told him that he ''wanted us to be a better and more peaceful society.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Mr. Nixon promised that residents of Ferguson would see a different tone in the response by police, in which tear gas and rubber bullets have been used to control the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public,''Mr. Nixon said in a statement. ''We must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Thursday, a group identifying itself as Anonymous, the computer hacking collective, disclosed what it said was the name of the police officer who fatally shot Mr. Brown. Writing on Twitter, the group said it would publish additional information about the officer, including his photograph, if it did not receive a response from the St. Louis County Police Department, which is overseeing one of the investigations into the death of Mr. Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The name of the officer released by Anonymous could not be immediately confirmed. But the St. Louis County Police said on Twitter that the name released by Anonymous was ''not even an officer with St. Louis County or Ferguson.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ferguson Police Department has declined to release the name of the officer, citing concerns for the safety of the officer and his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday night, Ferguson was buffeted by another round of protests over the shooting. The selective release of information by the authorities about the shooting, and especially the anonymity granted to the officer, have stoked frustrations in this largely African-American community north of St. Louis, where residents describe tense relations with the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief, Thomas Jackson, has declined to identify the officer, who has been put on administrative leave. Chief Jackson said Wednesday that the officer who shot Mr. Brown had been struck in the face during the encounter and treated at a hospital. The chief said that a side of the officer's face was swollen from what the police have described as a struggle in which Mr. Brown assaulted the officer and tried to take his gun - an account disputed by a witness, a friend of Mr. Brown's who said his hands were raised when the last of several shots was fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite persistent and increasingly angry calls from the public to release the officer's name, Chief Jackson said the officer required protection after numerous death threats had been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Computer hackers, saying they were outraged by the department's conduct, have also joined the fray. Anonymous said Wednesday on Twitter that it had broken into Ferguson's municipal computer system. It released details about city workers and posted photos of Jon Belmar, the chief of the St. Louis County Police, who is conducting the investigation into the shooting, as well as those of his wife, son and daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday night, scores of police officers in riot gear and in armored trucks showed up to disperse protesters who had gathered on the streets near the scene of the shooting. A police spokesman said that some demonstrators had thrown firebombs at officers and that some had tried to set fires. The police used tear gas on demonstrators, and some protesters said rubber bullets had been fired at them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police made more than 10 arrests. Among them was Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman, who had been documenting the protests on social media, his wife said on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two reporters covering the protests said they had been arrested inside a McDonald's on accusations of trespassing and released without charges or an explanation. The reporters, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of The Huffington Post, both said they had been handled roughly by the police.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gun Control: A federal judge rules that the AR-15 and similar weapons commonly used in self-defense &quot;fall outside Second Amendment protection as dangerous and unusual arms,&quot; and we have no right to keep or bear them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody looted the gun shop and tattoo parlor that share a storefront in a strip mall less than 10 minutes from Ferguson, Mo., where riots followed the police shooting of Michael Brown.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the local Riverfront Times, the owners of County Guns and Tattoo Studio arrived with friends to protect their businesses. One owner carried a rifle and pistol and wore a vest, while the other had his own rifle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their defensive use of firearms as rioters burned and looted other stores in the strip mall couldn't have occurred in Maryland. There, AR-15-style weapons are banned, more because of the rifles' &quot;scary&quot; appearance than their lethality. Maryland's Firearm Safety Act of 2013 makes their possession and open carry illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Ferguson riots raged, U.S. District Judge Catherine C. Blake, appointed by President Clinton, issued a ruling that upheld the Maryland law, saying, &quot;the court seriously doubts that the banned assault long guns are commonly possessed for lawful purposes . . . and is inclined to find the weapons fall outside Second Amendment protection as dangerous and unusual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the Second Amendment, written in the era of muskets, does not mention what arms we have the right to keep and bear. But we have an idea, based on how they were used: to protect their owners' homes, businesses, farms and families, and to fight the tyranny of the British crown. It's been said that the Second Amendment was put in the Bill of Rights to protect the other nine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gun control advocates say, with some snarkiness, that the Second Amendment doesn't allow one to own nuclear weapons or tanks, so it's merely a question of where we draw the line. They would draw the line at the AR-15 and its counterparts -- which, despite the judge's claim, are commonly used for legal, defensive purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AR-15 is among the guns that must be registered. They've made up 50%-60% of U.S. rifle sales in recent years, federal figures show. The New York Times recently called the AR-15 &quot;The Most Wanted Gun In America.&quot; Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has been pushing a bill to reintroduce the ineffective assault weapons 1994 ban that expired in 2004 with no impact on the crime rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feinstein's legislation would outlaw more than 150 types of weapons, from rifles to pistols to shotguns. They include the Streetsweeper and Striker-12, which, again, have frightening appearances yet chamber the same 12-gauge shells that are used to hunt birds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While used in several high-profile mass shootings, the AR-15 is favored among homeowners, hunters and sport shooters. It's popular for both sport and self-defense among women, who find it easy to carry and handle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime rates and homicides have dropped as concealed-carry laws spread nationwide. As more citizens are armed, predators find it harder to find unarmed victims except in gun-free zones such as the school in Newtown, Conn., or the theater in Aurora, Colo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All guns are dangerous, particularly when used by rioters and other criminals. But in the hands of law-abiding citizens, they are exactly what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they wrote the Second Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American president Barack Obama said there was &quot;no excuse for police to use excessive force&quot;, after a fourth night of confrontation in Ferguson, Missouri, over the death of an unarmed teenager, Michael Brown.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We lost a young man in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances,&quot; Mr Obama said of Brown, who was shot dead by police on Saturday. &quot;He was 18 years old and his family will never hold Michael in their arms again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there was no excuse for violence against police, but equally there was &quot;no excuse for police to use excessive force&quot; in response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appealing for calm, he said: &quot;Now's the time for healing, now's the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.&quot; He also condemned the arrest of reporters. &quot;Here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama's comments came a fourth night of confrontation in Ferguson, where residents of the majority black town of 21,000 people have been protesting against the killing of Brown by an officer from the overwhelmingly white police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snipers The response to the protest had been led by the St Louis County police force, which has deployed snipers, armoured vehicles and officers in military combat gear to quell protests on successive evenings since the Brown's death. Two reporters, with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Washington Post</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Huffington Post</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, were arrested on Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor of Missouri, Jay Nixon, was due to make a statement about the police response yesterday, amid speculation that he was to removed the St Louis police department from the lead role in responding to the protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The worsening situation in Ferguson is deeply troubling,&quot; said Nixon  on Wednesday evening. &quot;While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble, and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged law enforcement agencies to &quot;keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senior US senator for Missouri, Claire McCaskill, said she had been working to &quot;demilitarise&quot; the situation. She said yesterday: &quot;This kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution. I obviously respect law enforcement's work to provide public safety, but my constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests, and the police need to respect that right and protect that right. Today is going to be a new start - we can and need to do better.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEAVILY armed police fired tear gas, stun grenades and smoke bombs as America's worst race riots for more than a decade re-ignited for a fourth consecutive night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rioters - on the streets after a police officer shot dead an unarmed black teenager - replied with rocks, petrol bombs and chants of 'Hands up, don't shoot'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man identified on Twitter as the officer behind the shooting in Missouri was last night in hiding - though it later emerged that hackers had named the wrong man. President Obama has asked to be briefed on the clashes in Ferguson, a suburb about 20km north of the city of St Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence follows the death of black teenager Michael Brown last Saturday. Friends claim he had his arms in the air when he was shot several times during an arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, officials in Ferguson said the 18-year-old was involved in struggle for a police gun and the officer who fired the fatal shots was wounded in the face in the scuffle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gangs of youths in the suburb took to the streets and so far more than 20 shops have been looted and dozens of arrests made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family of the victim demanded an inquiry into the shooting but also appealed for calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses say that largely peaceful demonstrations during daylight hours have turned into rioting as the police try to enforce an evening curfew by blocking roads with armoured vehicles. Police are also accused of heavy-handed tactics. Soon after Brown's shooting they began using dogs for crowd control - a tactic that for some was a reminder of civil rights protests a half-century ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County police chief Jon Belmar insisted his officers have responded with 'an incredible amount of restraint', because they have been the targets of rocks, bottles and gunshots, with 24 patrol vehicles being destroyed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- The Missouri Highway Patrol seized control of a St. Louis suburb Thursday, stripping local police of their law-enforcement authority after four days of clashes between officers in riot gear and furious crowds protesting the death of an unarmed black teen shot by an officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intervention, ordered by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, came as President Barack Obama spoke publicly for the first time about Saturday's fatal shooting of Michael Brown and the subsequent violence that shocked the nation and threatened to tear apart Ferguson, a town that is nearly 70 percent black patrolled by a nearly all-white police force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said there was &quot;no excuse&quot; for violence either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon's promise to ease the deep racial tensions was swiftly put to the test as demonstrators gathered again Thursday evening in the neighborhood where looters smashed and burned businesses on Sunday and police repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the latest protests were a world apart from the earlier demonstrations, with a light, even festive atmosphere and no hint of violence. The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protester Cleo Willis said the change was palpable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can feel it. You can see it,&quot; he said. &quot;Now it's up to us to ride that feeling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a particularly violent Wednesday night, Nixon said local police would no longer be in charge of the area, although they would still be present. He said Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black, would be in command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change was meant to ensure &quot;that we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit and let some of the energy be felt in this region appropriately,&quot; Nixon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,&quot; the governor said at a news conference in the nearby community of Normandy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor was joined at a news conference by the white mayor of St. Louis and the region's four state representatives and the county executive, all of whom are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said he grew up in the area and &quot;it means a lot to me personally that we break this cycle of violence.&quot; He said he planned to keep heavily armored vehicles away from the scene and told his officers not to bring their gas masks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By late afternoon, Johnson was walking down the street with a large group of protesters as they chanted &quot;Hands up, don't shoot,&quot; a reference to witness accounts that described Brown as having his hands in the air when the officer kept firing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He planned to talk to the demonstrators throughout the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to have some conversations with them and get an understanding of what's going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, Johnson spoke to several young men wearing red bandanas around their necks and faces. After the discussion, one of the men reached out and embraced him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the burned-out QuikTrip near the shooting scene, children drew on the ground with chalk and people left messages about Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Thursday, Obama appealed for &quot;peace and calm&quot; on the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,&quot; Obama said, speaking from the Massachusetts island where he's on a two-week vacation. &quot;But let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes the belief in equality under the law, respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents in Ferguson have complained about the police response that began soon after Brown's shooting with the use of dogs for crowd control -- a tactic that for some evoked civil-rights protests from a half-century ago. The county police took over, leading both the investigation of Brown's shooting and the subsequent attempts to keep the peace at the request of the smaller city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County Police Chief Jon Belmar said his officers have responded with &quot;an incredible amount of restraint&quot; as they've had rocks and bottles thrown at them, been shot at and had two dozen patrol vehicles destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city and county are also under criticism for refusing to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, citing threats against that officer and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hacker group Anonymous on Thursday released a name purported to be that of the officer, but the Ferguson police chief said later that the name was incorrect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like last year's Trayvon Martin shooting, social media brought international attention to a tragedy that might otherwise have been known only to the immediate community. Ferguson spawned a proliferation of hashtags and was the dominant subject Thursday on Twitter, Facebook and other sites. Journalists and protesters offered real-time pictures, videos and text reports, and the world responded, often in outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer involved was injured, with one side of his face swollen, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told reporters that the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric Holder has said federal investigators have interviewed eyewitnesses to the shooting. A person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, said federal authorities have interviewed Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder spoke by telephone Thursday with Brown's family to offer condolences and to tell them that the Justice Department was committed to a full and independent investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Associated Press writers Alan Scher Zagier and Jim Suhr in Ferguson, Eric Tucker in Washington and Hillel Italie in New York, and AP researcher Rhonda Shafner, also in New York, contributed to this report.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Events in Ferguson, Missouri, seem far away from the relative calm of coastal California, but the slaying of the unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown and the resulting civil unrest is a reminder that we're far from the so-called post-racial world that optimists had once predicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as supportive as we are of the challenges facing law enforcement in today's world, we lament the declining confidence that many in our communities are feeling about the fairness of the police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individual events take on massive importance in today's hyper-connected world. A killing in Ferguson   a town virtually unknown a week ago   now dominates our television screens and social media feeds. Importantly, that awareness tends to make us look into our own communities and contemplate how well justice is delivered and whether all people, regardless of ethnicity, are being treated fairly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, we must do better. Not just the police   everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've long argued that society leaves too many of our social problems aside and asks the police to clean it all up for us. Homelessness, gang violence, poverty and mental illness are all of society's making, but the first line of defense against law and order is left to the men and women of law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we expect perfection from them. The large majority of police officers handle all sorts of social and criminal situations daily with unsullied professionalism. We really only hear about cases when something goes wrong. Alas, things do go wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That drama plays out here   in Monterey, Salinas, Watsonville and Santa Cruz. Crime and violence is all too real, and it generally victimizes those who can afford it least in the neighborhoods where poverty and unemployment dominate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Salinas, the community is asking for answers following four fatal officer shootings in the past few months   all of which resulted in the deaths of Latino men. In Santa Cruz, the situation was a reminder that the danger works both ways   two officers slain last year by a lone gunman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for events in Ferguson, we were encouraged by the words of President Obama, who both issued a call for calm and also a request for a full investigation of both the shooting of the young man and the aftermath of police action in making widespread arrests   even of reporters trying to cover the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police behavior, even here in the Monterey Bay area, is and should be under the microscope. Not only are officers responsible for their own behavior, but they are impacted by the deeds and misdeeds of the police nationwide. It may not be fair, but that's part of the job they took on when they were sworn in. After all, they're the ones with the guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on what happened in Ferguson, and what has happened in racially-tinged cases throughout the country, we've now handed the police another job   to demonstrate that they can enforce the law in an even-handed manner. We're asking them to be better than the rest of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuing efforts to further diversify the workforce is a start. Absolute openness after any sort of questionable event is of unquestioned necessity. Community outreach is already a strategy in place at most local departments, but too much of it is still not enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some say that the police are the problem. That may or may not be true. But we're convinced that better law enforcement is the solution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They urged the citizens of Ferguson, Mo., to confront the police in the streets. They caused the city's web servers to crash, forcing officials to communicate by text. They posted the names and address of the county police chief's family. And then on Thursday they released what they said was the name of the police officer who killed Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of Anonymous -- the shadowy, snide international collective of hackers and online activists -- have played a key role in the growing confrontation outside St. Louis over Mr. Brown's death, goading and threatening the authorities, and calling the effort Operation Ferguson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operations in the collective's decade-long history have included taking down the World Cup website to protest poverty, helping identify assailants in a rape case in Ohio, cheering on the Occupy Wall Street movement and carrying out coordinated cyberassaults on repressive foreign governments. But this one ran into trouble faster than most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis police said on Twitter that the name given out was wrong, and that the man was not even a police officer. Within Anonymous there was an unusual amount of dissent. In interviews, in private chat channels and on Twitter, members accused those who had initially posted details of producing faulty information and putting one another in harm's way by openly chatting about their methods online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Twitter suspended @TheAnonMessage, the account that had posted the dubious information about the officer, although Twitter officials declined to say why. Those behind the account said in an email that they would post information from a backup account, @TheAnonMessage2, while other Twitter accounts affiliated with Anonymous tried to distance themselves from the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''But for the record, one last time. Operation Ferguson has NOT, repeat NOT released the name of Mike Brown's killer, nor have we claimed to,'' the individual behind the Operation Ferguson account said on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabriella Coleman, an anthropologist who studies Anonymous and teaches at McGill University in Montreal, said she was taken aback that members of Anonymous would be so quick to release unverified information, and would speak so openly about their methods in online chat channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''My jaw was dropping,'' Ms. Coleman said, reading members' communications. ''I was surprised because what I was seeing was suggestive but not definitive. Anonymous tends to care about its image quite a bit, and if they were wrong, it would be really bad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In private chat channels early Thursday, she said, members argued about the release of a photo of a man who resembled one of the officers at the scene of Mr. Brown's shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of it was reminiscent of past Anonymous campaigns, such as that prompted by a rape case in Steubenville, Ohio, and another three years ago in Manhattan, when hackers identified a high-ranking police officer who pepper-sprayed Occupy Wall Street protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Ferguson case, many were drawn to the Anonymous campaign after Tef Poe, a St. Louis rapper, began posting live video and news updates to his Twitter, Vine and Instagram feeds this week. By Monday, the Operation Ferguson Twitter account had been set up, and prominent members of Anonymous had joined the effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members assert that the organization is not a group but a loose collective working to advance similar ideals -- but sometimes contradictory ones. While Anonymous espouses privacy, its members also use the release of others' personal information as a tactic in cases where they believe the authorities are not acting in the public interest, or the news media has not released pertinent information. Members are quick to condemn any individual who claims to speak for the entire collective, and dissent and infighting are common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members also sought to explain the internal bickering and uncoordinated communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''For those new to Anonymous, it's a global collective of millions of autonomous individuals and groups,'' an Operation Ferguson post on Twitter said. ''Each is responsible for themselves only.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since a prominent Anonymous hacker, Hector Xavier Monsegur, became a federal informant more than two years ago, members of the collective have taken great pains to use Internet security and anonymity software tools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some members were desperate in their pleas this week that the man's photo not be released until more definitive information had been gathered. Ultimately, some members held a vote and decided to release the photo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But within hours, many had backtracked. Some openly said the ''dox'' -- a hacking term for the release of an individual's personal information -- had been wrong. ''The original dox were faulty, it happens, an excess of zeal,'' one Anonymous member said in a direct message on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The infighting seemed to have taken its toll. Those behind the @TheAnonMessage2 account, who were behind the initial disclosures, had grown considerably more circumspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''ANNOUNCEMENT: We are ceasing any future dox releases until further notice,'' they posted on Twitter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Higher authorities wisely stepped into the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo., on Thursday after a night that startled the nation with images of police overkill: flash grenades, rubber bullets and huge clouds of tear gas fired at demonstrators protesting the police shooting Saturday of an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Jay Nixon -- after keeping a low profile for too long -- made an urgent tour of the town and replaced local police officers with the Missouri State Highway Patrol. He gave the Highway Patrol an order that should have been given over the weekend: Let protesters who are angry about the shooting protest peacefully, without aggressive demands to disperse, as is their constitutional right. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's time to make sure, he said, ''that we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit and let some of the energy be felt in this region appropriately.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, President Obama denounced tactics of ''excessive force'' by the police and the ''bullying'' and arrest of journalists trying to cover the news. He said the federal investigation into the incident, which began earlier this week, must determine exactly what happened to Michael Brown, the 18-year-old shooting victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local authorities, including the police, have ''a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death and how they are protecting the people in their communities,'' Mr. Obama said, noting the ''violent turn'' in street confrontations that have been seen on screens around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two executives conferred and acted after anger and frustration in the streets had descended into widespread looting by some protesters earlier in the week, countered by aggressive street policing by officers outfitted in war gear who too often veered toward provocation more than protection. ''The police response has become part of the problem,'' Senator Claire McCaskill told residents during a visit, saying authorities had to ''demilitarize'' the force, which has aimed sniper rifles at innocent protesters and sent tear gas into people's backyards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief among the transparency issues for protesters has been local authorities' adamant and inexcusable refusal to identify the police officer who shot Mr. Brown, saying the officer faced death threats. Residents have a right to know whether the officer has a record of reckless behavior, and whether the officer lives in the community among the residents being patrolled, or in a very different neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other communities across the nation have safely demonstrated greater openness in similarly tense situations by eventually identifying and protecting an officer as a matter of the public's right to know. This should be the course taken in Ferguson if citizens are not to be further outraged at embattled authorities' stonewalling. ''When we get answers, things will calm down,'' one resident told The Times's Julie Bosman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nixon said Ferguson would become known ''as a community that pulled together to overcome'' violence. But first local politicians and law enforcement leaders will have to talk to residents to understand the deep vein of mistrust that has grown over the decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restoring a sense of justice will not be an easy task in the town of 21,000, which is 69 percent black yet remains under white government leadership. While authorities have the right to respond forcefully to looting and violent rioting, the unyielding use of military tactics and abusive behavior have widened that rift. Once the tear gas has dissipated, Mr. Nixon and Mr. Obama have an obligation to ensure that a real dialogue begins in Ferguson and other racially segregated areas, in hopes of keeping armored vehicles off the streets of America.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELLERIVE, Mo. -- When Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri stepped to the lectern at a university here on Thursday afternoon, he confronted one of the toughest challenges of his political career: the police killing of an unarmed black teenager in suburban St. Louis and the violent unrest that followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he announced that he had ordered the State Highway Patrol to take over command of the police in the troubled city of Ferguson, he was by turns defensive and resolute, sentimental and personal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pushed away broad questions about healing by saying, ''We're a little focused right now on operational specifics.'' At another point, when asked about his relationship with the black community, he spoke of the relationships he had with ''so many of my friends over so many years'' and went on to say, ''I don't think this is a time to divide.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nixon, 58, has had a successful political career by most measures. He is finishing his second and final term as a Democrat in a solidly Republican state. But when he first ran for national office, seeking a Senate seat in 1988, he was trounced by the incumbent Republican, Senator John C. Danforth. Mr. Nixon rebounded, serving for years in the State Senate, then as attorney general, and winning the race for governor in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As governor, he has constantly sought a middle ground, sometimes vetoing tax cuts and abortion restrictions from the Republican-led legislature, sometimes allowing certain abortion restrictions to go into effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there has been a history of strain between Mr. Nixon and the black community that dates to the 1990s, when he was attorney general. He fought to end a school desegregation program that bused children from St. Louis schools to surrounding communities with better districts. The program, which was the result of the settlement of a court case, continues to this day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even on Thursday, as he was joined by black public officials during the nearly 40-minute news conference, and even though he appeared with black clergy members earlier in the day, some black leaders in Missouri criticized him as being insensitive to their community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I truly believe,'' said State Senator Jamilah Nasheed, a former leader of the Legislative Black Caucus, ''the governor hasn't been in touch with the black community like he should.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nixon has been criticized as being slow to respond to the shooting and unrest in Ferguson, where the police are still investigating the death of Michael Brown, 18, on Saturday. Mr. Nixon did issue a statement calling for a federal investigation into the shooting two days after it happened. And he did appear this week at a St. Louis County church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, he took his boldest steps yet, canceling an appearance at the Missouri State Fair to come here to announce changes in the police command in Ferguson. Under St. Louis County police supervision, chaos had broken out in Ferguson over several nights, with officers firing rubber bullets and unleashing tear gas on protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, some have seen Mr. Nixon's actions as too little, too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think his historical lack of authentic connections and engagement with the black community is apparent in this situation by what I consider to be a tardy response to what is happening in Ferguson,'' said Gwendolyn Grant, the president and chief executive of the Urban League of Greater Kansas City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics say the governor has a habit of responding to pressing issues for black residents only after he faces great public pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nixon said during the news conference that he refused to inject race into the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past year, members of the state's Legislative Black Caucus have openly feuded with the governor over policy proposals that they said would have deprived the needy of food stamps and taken away housing tax credits for low-income Missourians. Leaders in Kansas City were frustrated when he did not meet with them recently to discuss the city's struggles with a school district that lost its accreditation a couple of years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nixon met with members of the Legislative Black Caucus in January, but they said it had taken a year for them to get him to come to the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before that meeting, Ms. Nasheed, a Democrat, who led the caucus at the time, held a news conference with the lieutenant governor, Peter Kinder, a Republican, to denounce the governor's threat to eliminate the low-income housing tax credit. When Mr. Nixon walked into the meeting, Ms. Nasheed recalled, ''the first thing he said was, 'I don't like the fact that the chair of this caucus stood alongside a Republican attacking me.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nixon also has been criticized for the lack of diversity in his administration. In his sixth year in office, the governor has appointed one African-American to direct an executive department. This in a state whose two major cities, Kansas City and St. Louis, have large black populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a spokesman for the governor noted that he had received strong support from black residents for efforts like his push to expand Medicaid and a veto of legislation that would have eliminated important provisions from the Missouri Human Rights Act. The governor has also appointed blacks to state boards and commissions, as well as the state's Supreme Court, Court of Appeals and Board of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It appears to me that he's working more closely with the African-American community, putting African-Americans in key positions in state government and supporting issues that are important to us,'' said Harold Crumpton, a former president of the St. Louis N.A.A.C.P., who now leads a community development organization in the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Danny Lyon, one of the photographers whose work came to define the civil rights upheaval in the South in the 1960s, said he was struck on Thursday when he saw a news image from the racially torn suburb of Ferguson, Mo., showing four police officers arrayed in a phalanx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In part, it was because Mr. Lyon had taken a picture in 1963 in Birmingham, Ala., that looked very much like it: four officers standing in front of a police car with rifles and helmets, in a city where highly publicized clashes between protesters and the police helped turn the tide of public opinion toward the civil rights movement. But the image from Ferguson, for all its formal similarities, could not have been more different. Today's riot police officers were wearing military-style camouflage and carrying military-style rifles, their heads and faces obscured by black helmets and gas masks as they stood in front of an armored vehicle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It didn't look like America. It looked like Soweto,'' Mr. Lyon said, referring to the South African township that was a hotbed of protests against apartheid. ''It looked like soldiers. And soldiers' job isn't to protect. Their job is to kill people and to be ready to die.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photographs that have emerged during several days of unrest in Ferguson after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer have drawn mournful comparisons to pictures of the Deep South in the 1960s or of more recent racial unrest, like the 1992 Los Angeles riots. But they have also prompted a flood of commentary about the differences half a century has made in the visual economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have raised questions about whether photos have the same power now to sway public opinion and political will; about the increasingly sophisticated ways an image-saturated public reads a picture's racial and political subtext; and about the rapid transformation of the protests, even more so than the Los Angeles riots or the Occupy movement, into a war of images. The war pits what appears to be a large-scale paramilitary police presence against crowds of African-American protesters walking with their hands raised in surrender -- or people throwing things and looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Philadelphia Daily News was a case in point in the speed with which 21st-century image parsing can occur. In the wee hours of Thursday morning -- in response to readers' comments on Twitter about a photo the newspaper had planned to run on its front page, showing an African-American protester in Ferguson about to hurl what looked like a firebomb -- editors changed their minds and instead used a photograph of an African-American woman standing in front of police officers, holding a sign urging answers in the death of the teenager, Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An assistant city editor wrote on Twitter to those objecting to the first picture that they would be able to understand the whole story, in a ''sympathetic treatment,'' if they opened the paper. But a reader responded, ''Yes, in ten-point font I can see the fine print, which is completely overwhelmed by the picture.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the civil rights era, the visual stamp of the movement was determined by newspapers and the nightly news. Today, the imagery one sees depends on the filters one uses. One person's Twitter feed may be full of footage of police firing tear gas or of peaceful protesters with their hands up. But David J. Garrow, a historian at the University of Pittsburgh's law school and the author of several books on the civil rights movement, noted that when he searched for images of Ferguson on Google, roughly half showed what appeared to be looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such images look ''more like Watts in 1965 or Newark in 1967, not Birmingham in 1963 or Selma in 1965,'' Dr. Garrow said. And historically, he said, such photos were ''deadly when it came to white public opinion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ferguson, the police seem to be just as worried about the dominance of certain imagery. The city's police chief, Thomas Jackson, said during a news conference Thursday that officials were meeting ''to talk about not only the tactics but the appearance'' of the police force, whose resemblance to American soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan has quickly become a social media theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some visual echoes of the 1960s, like the Ferguson police's use of dogs, may be unintentional. (During the 1963 March on Washington, President John F. Kennedy forbade the use of dogs for crowd control, knowing how badly it would play.) But on the protesters' side, there have been deliberate efforts to evoke the nonviolent protests of the civil rights era, like T-shirts with the slogan ''I Am a Man,'' borrowed from signs carried during the 1968 Memphis sanitation strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diane McWhorter, the author of ''Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama, the Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution,'' said she also saw echoes of those signs in the protesters' hands-up gesture, an instantly recognizable cue that seems to be both born of the quick-read Internet news cycle and able to shape it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In one case, it's a kind of mass witness of personhood,'' Ms. McWhorter said of the ''I Am a Man'' signs, ''and in the other case, a mass witness of innocence. Those images are very powerful.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some historians see dangers in those visual echoes. Martin A. Berger, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the author of ''Seeing Through Race: A Reinterpretation of Civil Rights Photography,'' said that while images of a protester throwing a firebomb or of the police spraying tear gas may start conversations, the historical associations can also distort public understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We can look at these pictures and say that Ferguson is the same as Los Angeles or Birmingham, because it looks the same,'' Dr. Berger said. ''But we have to ask not just, 'What is the same?' but also, 'What are the ways in which America has changed?' To just have another conversation that stops at the level of police brutality doesn't really get us very far.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. -- President Obama on Thursday called for an end to the violence here, denouncing actions both by the police and by protesters. Hours later, the Missouri governor, Jay Nixon, ordered the state highway patrol to take over security operations from local law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clashes between heavily armed police officers and furious protesters in Ferguson have defined the aftermath of an officer's fatal shooting of an unarmed teenager on Saturday, and the latest moves came as federal and state officials scrambled to quell the growing crisis. Alarm had been rising across the country at images of a mostly white police force, in a predominantly African-American community, aiming military-style weapons at protesters and firing tear gas and rubber bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, the highway patrol official appointed by the governor to take over the response, immediately signaled a change in approach. Captain Johnson told reporters he had ordered troopers to remove their tear-gas masks, and in the early evening he accompanied several groups of protesters through the streets, clasping hands, listening to stories and marching alongside them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday night, the armored vehicles and police cars were gone, and the atmosphere was celebratory. A street barricaded on previous nights was filled with slow-moving cars blasting their horns. A man played a drum across the street from a convenience store that was looted this week. And there were few signs of police officers, let alone a forceful response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimaly Diouf, co-owner of Rehoboth Pharmacy, said the reason for the difference was simple: ''Because they're not tear gassing us tonight.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Johnson, who is African-American and grew up in the area, said: ''We're just starting today anew. We're starting a new partnership today. We're going to move forward today, to put yesterday and the day before behind us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticism of the police response, already heavy because officials have refused to name the officer involved in the shooting, intensified after two journalists were arrested Wednesday while recharging their phones and working on their articles at a local McDonald's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governor Nixon, appearing defensive at times at a briefing in St. Louis County on Thursday afternoon, did not criticize the local police but said of Ferguson, ''Lately, it's looked a little bit more like a war zone, and that's not acceptable.'' He said he had met with residents and listened to their concerns, and said of Michael Brown, the 18-year-old killed by the police in disputed circumstances on Saturday, that ''a young man, a man not much younger than my own sons, lost his life.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nixon, a Democrat, who was state attorney general before being elected governor in 2008, did not describe specific changes to police practices, uniforms or equipment, but said it was time for a ''different tone'' that balanced the need to prevent looting with the right of residents to assemble and demonstrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence, but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,'' Mr. Nixon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama, speaking to reporters at a hastily arranged news conference on Martha's Vineyard, where he is vacationing, denounced attacks both on the police and on protesters, and pleaded for ''peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.'' He said he had spoken to Mr. Nixon and confirmed that he had instructed the Justice Department and the F.B.I. to investigate the fatal shooting, ''to help determine exactly what happened and to see that justice is done.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local police continued to face criticism for their refusal to identify the officer who shot Mr. Brown. On Thursday, a group identifying itself as Anonymous, the computer hacking collective, disclosed what it said was the name, but the St. Louis County police said it was wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said that local officials had ''a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death.'' And he said the Justice Department was consulting with the local officials about appropriate responses to the protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,'' he said. ''There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also criticized the detentions of reporters, saying, ''Here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To many, though, the president seemed less emotional and personal than he had been two years ago, when he called for ''soul searching'' after the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, a young black man in Florida. ''You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,'' he said then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multiple national officials criticized the decision of the police in Ferguson to use military-style garb and equipment to respond to the protests. ''At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,'' Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in a statement. Later on Thursday, Mr. Holder called Mr. Brown's parents and promised a full, independent investigation, according to a Justice Department official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the political spectrum, officials seemed to agree. ''The militarization of the response became more of the problem than any solution,'' Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, told reporters in Ferguson. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who has become a favorite of the American left, said on Twitter, ''This is America, not a war zone.'' And Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican with libertarian leanings and presidential aspirations, wrote an essay for Time in which he called the militarization of the police ''an unprecedented expansion of government power'' and said, ''The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere in the country, rallies were held to demand justice for Mr. Brown and to protest police tactics. In Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Phoenix, thousands of protesters gathered in public squares with their hands up in gestures of surrender, chanting slogans like, ''Hands up, don't shoot.'' In Miami, eight people were arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ferguson, officials were unapologetic on Thursday for their tough response to the protesters, which they said had been necessitated by violence and criminality: The police said some protesters had thrown rocks, bottles and even a firebomb at officers. If the situation warrants it, ''the tactical units will be out there,'' said the Ferguson police chief, Thomas Jackson. ''If the crowd is being violent and you don't want to be violent, get out of the crowd.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The county executive, Charlie A. Dooley, called on residents to ''calm down, stand down and be reasonable.'' But the mayor of St. Louis, Francis G. Slay, struck a different tone, describing himself as ''sad and angry'' and saying: ''Justice must happen. The grieving must be comforted. The angry must be heard. The innocent must be protected.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local police units were still helping to patrol Ferguson, but under a new command. The changes were obvious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Johnson, walking through the streets on Thursday, was approached by Karen Wood, who had been clutching a bright green sign against police brutality. ''Do you have a minute to at least talk to, you know, a parent?'' Ms. Wood asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The captain, a veteran law enforcement officer assigned to oversee security here, stopped. As sweat stained his blue uniform, he clasped Ms. Wood's right hand and stood, for several minutes, listening to her story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Our youth are out here without guidance, without leadership,'' Ms. Wood told Captain Johnson. ''It's important that they know there is an order.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Ms. Wood finished, Captain Johnson patted her right shoulder and said softly: ''I thank you. I thank you for your passion, and we're going to get better.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then joined a group of passing protesters, marching with them as his eyes scanned the roadway. ''I know a lot of them,'' he said. ''Our police department, we have to be reflective of our community, and that's why we're all out here.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jessica Daniel, who was marching with her young children, said she had listened to speeches by Ms. McCaskill and Mr. Nixon and perceived a change. ''The whole tone just turned around,'' she said. ''Now I feel like they are letting us know they think it's tragic, too. It's a beautiful thing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside a restaurant, London's Wing House, Kristopher Conner said he was upset both by Mr. Brown's death and by the violence that followed it. He put up a sign saying proceeds from soda purchases would benefit Mr. Brown's family. And as officials hoped for calm, so did he.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I just want it to get back to normal,'' Mr. Conner said. ''Before everything happened, it was peaceful. You'd come to work, and now some people are just kind of worried that something might start up again.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. -- For four nights in a row, they streamed onto West Florissant Avenue wearing camouflage, black helmets and vests with ''POLICE'' stamped on the back. They carried objects that doubled as warnings: assault rifles and ammunition, slender black nightsticks and gas masks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were not just one police force but many, hailing from communities throughout north St. Louis County and loosely coordinated by the county police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their adversaries were a ragtag group of mostly unarmed neighborhood residents, hundreds of African-Americans whose pent-up fury at the police had sent them pouring onto streets and sidewalks in Ferguson, demanding justice for Michael Brown, the 18-year-old who was fatally shot by a police officer on Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the protesters refused to retreat from the streets, threw firebombs or walked too close to a police officer, the response was swift and unrelenting: tear gas and rubber bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the rest of the world, the images of explosions, billowing tear gas and armored vehicles made this city look as if it belonged in a chaos-stricken corner of Eastern Europe, not the heart of the American Midwest. As a result, a broad call came from across the political spectrum for America's police forces to be demilitarized, and Gov. Jay Nixon installed a new overall commander in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community,'' Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said, ''I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, voiced similar sentiments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But such opposition amounts to a sharp change in tone in Washington, where the federal government has spent more than a decade paying for body armor, mine-resistant trucks and other military gear, all while putting few restrictions on its use. Grant programs that, in the name of fighting terrorism, paid for some of the equipment being used in Ferguson have been consistently popular since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. If there has been any debate at all, it was over which departments deserved the most money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department of Homeland Security grant money paid for the $360,000 Bearcat armored truck on patrol in Ferguson, said Nick Gragnani, executive director of St. Louis Area Regional Response System, which administers such grants for the St. Louis area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2003, the group has spent $9.4 million on equipment for the police in St. Louis County. That includes $3.6 million for two helicopters, plus the Bearcat, other vehicles and night vision equipment. Most of the body armor worn by officers responding to the Ferguson protests was paid for with federal money, Mr. Gragnani said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The focus is terrorism, but it's allowed to do a crossover for other types of responses,'' he said. ''It's for any type of civil unrest. We went by the grant guidance. There was no restriction put on that by the federal government.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the major Homeland Security grants do not pay for weapons, Justice Department grants do. That includes rubber bullets and tear gas, which the police use to disperse crowds. A Justice Department report last year said nearly 400 local police departments and more than 100 state agencies had bought such less-lethal weapons using Justice Department grant money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grants also paid for body armor, vehicles and surveillance equipment. It was not immediately clear if those grants had paid for equipment being used in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military also sent machine guns, armored trucks, aircraft and other surplus war equipment to local departments. Compared with other urban areas, however, St. Louis County has received little surplus military equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these programs began or were expanded in response to the Sept. 11 attacks, when the authorities in Washington declared that local police departments were on the front lines of a global war on terrorism. Terrorism is exceedingly rare, however, and the equipment and money far outpaced the threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You couldn't say that back then with as much certainty as you can say that now, though,'' said Frank J. Cilluffo, director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at George Washington University. After Sept. 11, few people asked whether the police would use the equipment against protesters, Mr. Cilluffo said. ''By and large, I don't recall an outcry of any sort historically along these lines.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most instances, the government did not require training for police departments receiving military-style equipment and few if any limitations were put on its use, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase in military-style equipment has coincided with a significant rise in the number of police SWAT teams, which are increasingly being used for routine duties such as conducting liquor inspections and serving warrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, much of the equipment has gone unnoticed. But as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have drawn down, police departments have been receiving 30-ton, mine-resistant trucks from the military. That has caught the attention of the public and caused controversy in several towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowhere has the deployment of military-style equipment been on starker display than this week in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center of the protests is West Florissant Avenue, a run-down commercial strip that runs north-south. On it stands a nail salon, a barbecue restaurant and the burned-out remnants of a QuikTrip convenience store that looters targeted on Sunday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late each afternoon, hundreds of people have trickled onto West Florissant, milling around on sidewalks and holding signs at television cameras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As more protesters gathered, the police followed in greater numbers. They set up barricades of traffic cones so that cars could not enter. Protesters, usually young black men, have approached the police with their hands up in the air, a gesture that has become a taunt. (A witness to the shooting on Saturday said Mr. Brown had his hands up when he was shot.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For three nights, the police made the same tactical move: When they determined that the protest was no longer peaceful, they used tear gas to force protesters off West Florissant and into the two residential neighborhoods on either side of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the protesters had been pushed onto side streets of small, one-story houses and low-slung apartment buildings, some of them said, they were effectively trapped on the wrong side of Florissant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Disperse! Go back to your homes!'' the police shouted, often from the top of armored vehicles, through megaphones whose orders echoed throughout the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We don't live here!'' several people shouted back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keonta Finch, 21, waited hours for the police to open the barricade on Monday. ''There's no way out,'' she said. ''I can't get home. I was just here to be peaceful, and now I'm stuck.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Finch echoed a common complaint from protesters: The police seemed unable to differentiate between people in the crowds who were causing trouble and those who were not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman who was identified as a pastor tried to calm some unruly members of the crowd on Wednesday; later that night, she was shot in the abdomen with a rubber bullet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Peaceful protesters are being conflated with rioters and looters,'' said Christopher Leonard, who joined a group of quiet protesters on Wednesday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists have also been caught up by the police use of weapons. On Monday night, the police aimed directly at a group of photographers and a reporter as they covered the growing protest. One photographer was hit with a rubber bullet. A police officer on Wednesday tossed a tear-gas canister directly at a television crew for Al Jazeera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday night, in the neighborhood on the east side of Florissant, several dozen people were drawn to the site where Mr. Brown was shot, on a gently looping street called Canfield Court. They stood in small groups and shared stories of harassment by the police; some people sat on their front stoops and smoked marijuana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly, just after 10 p.m., explosions boomed from what sounded like a few blocks away, stopping conversations cold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Firecrackers,'' one woman said, staring in the direction of Florissant. ''No, no, gunshots,'' a man said, telling everyone to drop to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a few minutes, it was clear what had happened: Tear gas was drifting into the neighborhood, enveloping houses, cars and people, who ran for cover in cars and houses, coughing and gasping as their eyes stung and vision blurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials have said that they felt they had no choice but to use tear gas and rubber bullets. They could not allow looting to happen again, they said, and dispersing the crowds was the only way to stop it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Thomas Jackson of the Ferguson police defended the use of force against demonstrators during the past five days and said heavily armed officers with military-style equipment would continue to be deployed if the authorities determined that circumstances warranted it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tactical units will be out there if firebombs are being thrown at officers or if demonstrators are otherwise behaving violently, Chief Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If the crowd is being violent,'' he said, ''and you don't want to be violent, get out of the crowd.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- When the police bring the hammer down, whether on Occupy Wall Street in Manhattan's Zuccotti Park in 2011 or outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968, the response from conservatives tend to be fairly consistent: The protesters got what they had coming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But demonstrations this week over the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., and the overwhelming law enforcement response that followed have stirred more complicated reactions, with many on the right torn between an impulse to see order restored and concern about whether the crackdown is a symptom of a state run amok. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With broadcasts from Ferguson showing the streets engulfed in smoke as officers looked on wearing military fatigues and carrying high-powered rifles, some prominent conservative commentators and leading Republican politicians began questioning whether the police had gone too far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These reactions point to a larger debate inside the conservative movement today as Republicans struggle with how enthusiastically to embrace an ascendant strain of libertarianism within their ranks. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a likely candidate for president in 2016, starkly laid out one side of the argument in an op-ed published on Time.com on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There should be a difference between a police response and a military response,'' he wrote. ''The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other conservatives have focused on instances in which chaos has broken out in the streets. Images and headlines on The Drudge Report and Breitbart.com have singled out acts of violence among demonstrators and shown looters breaking store windows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one segment broadcast on Fox News on Thursday, a reporter walked down the street with demonstrators who he said were members of the New Black Panther Party, a radical group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Richard M. Nixon made cracking down on crime a central issue of his 1968 presidential campaign, Republicans have held themselves up as the alternative to a Democratic Party they have derided as soft on issues of law and order. But an appetite for changes in the criminal justice system has been building among Republicans, many of whom believe the tough-justice approach has run its course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Paul, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin are among those who say that the federal and state governments need to rethink the way convicts are sentenced and imprisoned, arguing that the current system is inhumane and too costly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Paul's remarks on Thursday were similar to those of other leading conservatives who have weighed in on the events in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Reporters should never be detained -- a free press is too important -- simply for doing their jobs,'' Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, wrote on his Facebook page on Thursday, reacting to news that journalists from The Washington Post and The Huffington Post had been held by the police. ''Civil liberties must be protected, but violence is not the answer.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erick Erickson, a conservative writer, took to Twitter to question why the police needed to display so much firepower. ''It is pretty damn insane that people who spend all day writing speeding tickets,'' he wrote, ''hop in tanks with AR-15s at night.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many conservatives were unsettled by the militaristic response from law enforcement officials in Ferguson -- a show of force that they said dangerously resembled the actions a police state would take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Paul, quoting from research by the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute and the conservative Heritage Foundation, noted the trend of police departments' buying military-style vehicles and weapons, condemning ''the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When you couple this militarization of law enforcement,'' he added, ''with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury -- national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, preconviction forfeiture -- we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that attitude was not universally shared. In much of the conservative news media, the protesters in Ferguson are being portrayed as ''outside agitators,'' in the words of Sean Hannity, the Fox News host.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Erickson said, ''The natural reaction of conservatives, I think, has always been in defense of law and order.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But lately, he added, there has been an awakening among many on the right. Many see an increasingly disproportionate response to crime as a sign of a larger problem that should rattle the consciences of conservatives who are wary of centralized authority, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''As more and more people become aware of how overcriminalized the law and regulatory system of the United States is, they become aware of just how easily it is for them to be carted off to jail for innocuous behavior,'' Mr. Erickson said. ''That necessarily increases distrust of the system over all.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another question raised by the unrest in Ferguson -- one that poses far more discomfort for Republicans -- is how race plays into unequal treatment under the justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this delicate issue, Mr. Paul went a step further than many other conservatives this week. With a system so broken, he wrote, it is no wonder black people in Ferguson feel singled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added a personal aside. ''If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off,'' Mr. Paul wrote. ''But I wouldn't have expected to be shot.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- FERGUSON, Mo., has become a virtual war zone. In the wake of the shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, outsize armored vehicles have lined streets and tear gas has filled the air. Officers dressed in camouflage uniforms from Ferguson's 53-person police force have pointed M-16s at the very citizens they are sworn to protect and serve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police response has shocked America. The escalating tension in this town of 21,200 people between a largely white police department and a majority African-American community is a central part of the crisis, but the militarization of the police is a dimension of the story that has national implications. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson's police force got equipped this way thanks to the Pentagon, and it's happening all over the country. The Department of Defense provides military-grade weapons and equipment to local law enforcement agencies through the 1033 program, enacted by Congress in 1997 to expand the practice of dispensing extra military gear. Due to the defense industry's bloated contracts, there is a huge surplus. To date, the Pentagon has donated military equipment worth more than $4 billion to local law enforcement agencies. And the giving goes on, to police forces in all 50 states in the union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson's police department is just one recipient; small towns all over America are now the proud owners of ''MRAP'' armored vehicles. The largess has gotten so out of hand that a congressman, Hank C. Johnson, is introducing a bill to block the 1033 handouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas the Department of Defense hands over weapons directly, the Department of Homeland Security provides funding for arms. It has distributed more than $34 billion through ''terrorism grants,'' enabling local police departments to acquire such absurd items as a surveillance drone and an Army tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a police department like Ferguson's, the path to becoming a paramilitary force is a short one. After loading up with free military gear, it is no surprise that law enforcement agents want to use it. In fact, the 1033 program's regulations require that the police use what they receive within one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of extreme violence or actual terrorist threat, what happens -- as the American Civil Liberties Union has documented -- is that the equipment and weapons are used by SWAT teams in routine situations, such as low-level drug raids or the execution of search warrants. As Ferguson shows, this militarizing of routine police work exacerbates tensions and increases the likelihood of disorder. This, in turn, appears to justify a militarized police response, and so the cycle continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal government can stop this increased militarization at its source. The Pentagon must end its transfer of military-grade weapons through the 1033 program. And the Department of Homeland Security should stop handing out the terrorism grants. The ease with which police departments can avail themselves of Homeland Security funding for enormous caches of weapons and ammunition in the name of counterterrorism is deeply disconcerting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veteran police chiefs who have served on the front lines of America's biggest police forces are voicing their concern. Norman H. Stamper, the former police chief of Seattle, has written with regret about the military-style tactics employed during the protests against the 1999 World Trade Organization conference in Seattle; he now advocates ''an authentic partnership in policing the city,'' involving rank-and-file officers, civilian employees and community representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Militarizing our police officers does not have to be the first response to violence. Alternatives are available. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.'s statement Thursday highlighting resources like the Department of Justice's Community Oriented Policing Services office is welcome. This is where the government should be investing -- instead of grants for guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police militarization is a growing national threat. If the federal government doesn't act to stop it, the future of law enforcement everywhere will look a lot like Ferguson.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators in Ferguson, Mo. gathered on Wednesday for another round of protests over the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager who was killed over the weekend by a police officer. Mr. Brown's death has triggered days of protests that have brought national attention to racial tension between the police and the African-American community in the St. Louis suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters showed up in droves, marching along the streets near where Mr. Brown was gunned down and staying well into the night. They were met by heavily armed riot police and SWAT teams in armored cars in scenes that were captured in photos and videos on social media with hashtags like #MikeBrown and #Ferguson. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a nighttime protest that was streamed live online, protesters could be heard chanting ''We ain't leaving until we have justice.'' A line of police officers appeared to move closer to the crowd and fire what appeared to be rubber bullets and tear gas canisters, then set off sound cannons. A man narrating the video said the protest was peaceful and the attack was unprovoked. (Warning: the video contains strong language.)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After days of unrest in Ferguson, Mo. after the fatal shooting of an 18-year-old unarmed man, Michael Brown, organizers are planning vigils in more than 90 cities around the country to commemorate victims of police brutality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events were organized on Twitter by a loose network of Twitter users and social media activists under the hashtag #NMOS14, which stands for National Moment of Silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers have also used Facebook to invite and register participants for the vigils in each city. A Facebook page for the vigil in Civic Center Park in Denver, for example, listed about 200 people out of 1,400 invited indicated that they planned to attend. The vigil at Malcolm X Park in Washington had 1,400 registrants out of the 7,800 who were invited. Washington and Chicago are so far, expected to have the largest turnouts, organizers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a document listing the Facebook pages for the cities hosting vigils, organizers asked participants to tie a red cloth around their arms, except ''in areas where doing so can cause conflict.'' The vigils will begin at 7 p.m. Eastern time and a moment of silence is planned at 7:20 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly Hayes, who is helping to coordinate the Chicago vigil, which will be at the Richard J. Daley Center, said the event was expected to be peaceful and would include participants holding signs with the names and details of victims of ''folks from Chicago and all around the country who have fallen to police violence.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Hayes said the Chicago vigil would also include poetry readings and music by members of a nonprofit organization called the Black Youth Project. ''We want to make sure that the voices heard are coming out of the most heavily impacted communities,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vigils coincide with another set of rallies said to be organized by the hacktivist collective Anonymous that will be held in many of the same locations as the National Moment of Silence, a move that has been criticized by some of the vigil organizers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''To have Anonymous come along and say let's turn this peaceful moment into a day of rage is highly problematic,'' said a Twitter user and primary organizer of the vigils named Michelle who tweets under the moniker @FeministaJones, and declined to give her last name because she says she has received threats. ''The last thing we need is for police around America showing up because they anticipate Anonymous hackers showing up with their Guy Fawkes masks,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Hayes in Chicago said she did not have immediate concerns about the police clashing with attendees at the vigil but ''we will have lawyers and police liaisons on the ground just in case communication with the police is necessary.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama has no business criticizing the police in a &shy;riot-torn St. Louis suburb from his posh vacation retreat more than 1,200 miles away, a top law-enforcement union official said Thursday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;To police officers, the incongruity of his evaluating police tactics from the comfort of Martha's Vineyard in the horrible tragedy which occurred in Missouri and the ensuing events is unfortunate,&quot; Jim Pasco, executive director of the national Fraternal Order of Police, told The Post. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Obama on Thursday appealed for calm and took a shot at the police a day after he was dancing and smiling during a birthday party for the wife of a longtime friend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;There is also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights,&quot; Obama said of the mayhem since the police shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson, Mo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The cop who shot the teen is a member of Pasco's group and is being represented by one of its lawyers, Pasco said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In other developments: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n A fourth night of protests in Ferguson was more peaceful than previous nights. There were no reports of violence or police action, as officers struck a more conciliatory tone with demonstrators and did not use the heavy military-style tactics seen earlier in the week. There were also protests and vigils throughout the country. A peaceful New York City demonstration in Union Square led to four arrests as some of the crowd marched uptown to Times Square. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon had put the Missouri State Highway Patrol in charge in Ferguson, with Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black, running the operation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it,&quot; Nixon said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n St. Louis County police defended the use of tear gas Wednesday night to repel the bottle- and firebomb-throwing demonstrators. &quot;In talking to these guys, it is scary,&quot; a police spokesman said. &quot;They hear gunshots going off, and they don't know where they're coming from.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The turmoil in Ferguson, Missouri, provides a textbook example of what officials should not do when police kill an unarmed black teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost a week after Michael Brown was shot, the public still wasn't officially given the name of the officer who pulled the trigger. There was no official account of what happened and why. For days as protests swelled and turned violent, state and local elected officials were conspicuously absent instead of working tirelessly to cool passions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police responded to mounting protests by creating a war zone. The streets were flooded with armored vehicles, officers were clad in body armor and camouflage. High-powered assault weapons were pointed at the protesters and the media. Some were hit with tear gas and stun grenades. Two journalists were arrested while eating and charging cellphones at a McDonald's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This provocative response escalated a confrontation already roiled by race in the St. Louis suburb where two out of three residents are black, but practically all the police officers are white. The events were magnified by social media, including more than 6 million tweets, and by Wednesday the dramatic scenes were being streamed live around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After talking with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon yesterday, President Barack Obama called for badly needed balance when he said there is never an excuse for looting and violence against police - or for police to use excessive force against peaceful protesters. Nixon finally seemed to take charge by putting the state highway patrol in charge on the streets. The FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice are doing parallel investigations with local law enforcement. The facts will eventually come out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to win the public trust, and not just in Missouri, officials have to trust the public with information. Racially charged killings can't be dismissed as isolated incidents. There's an intolerable pattern nationally of unarmed black men dying at the hands of police. Fair adjudication of each case is critical. So is finding a way to avoid such senseless deaths.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of protesters marched up Broadway and shut down Times Square Thursday night, when what was supposed to be a national moment of silence for victims of police brutality held in Union Square Park turned into a protest march, ending in a handful of arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a St. Louis police officer on Saturday sparked protests in the streets of Ferguson, MO, and reports of police in riot gear using tear gas and rubber bullets on peaceful protesters has caused&nbsp;national outrage. The activist group Anonymous urged cities across the nation, via Twitter, to stage protests in solidarity with the citizens of Ferguson and to protest against police brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York especially, the topic of police brutality is still fresh in everyone's minds following Eric Garner's death as result from a police chokehold during an arrest in Staten Island last month. A yellow banner that read &quot;Eric Garner to Mike Brown, this has to stop now&quot; was laid on the ground of&nbsp;Union Square Park, where protesters gathered around Revolution Club members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, we're having a moment of silence, but we don't have to be silent,&quot; they shouted. &quot;We're here today to show the people in Ferguson that they are not alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the moment of silence never came. Instead, protesters were asked to shout out their personal stories about their interactions with the NYPD in their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm scared of the people who are here to protect and serve me,&quot; a girl called out. &quot;When I leave the house, my parents worry if I'll come home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is this 2014 or 1964?&quot; another protester shouted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd moved to speak in front of the police officers that were watching over the protests. Hoarse voices yelled out &quot;No More!&quot; and chanting &quot;No justice! No peace! No racist police!&quot; The Revolution Club then led the group up Broadway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the crowd progressed up Broadway, Brooklyn teen Johanan McDowell, 18, ran ahead, holding both hands in the air, and shouted, &quot;Hands up, don't shoot,&quot; reportedly the last words&nbsp;said&nbsp;by&nbsp;Brown before he was shot to death by a St. Louis police officer. He stopped chanting to look back at the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow, this is amazing,&quot; Mr. McDowell told the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Observer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I might cry. I never thought I'd be a part of something like this,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When protesters reached 42nd Street, their chants changed to &quot;I can't breathe,&quot; Garner's last words before he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters were greeted by heavy police force in Times Square. (Photo by Emma Hernandez)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters made their way around police barricades at 42nd and 47th streets, eventually marching across 42nd Street. They were stopped at the corner of 42nd and 9th, where they were met by a stronger barricade of NYPD vans. Officers with batons and flex cuffs kettled the crowd onto the sidewalk, and five arrests were made as the officers tried to peacefully disperse the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As officers began letting protesters out in small groups, Hells Kitchen resident Quentin Chestnut held his camera phone up, recording video of the officers as he walked out of the kettle. Mr. Chestnut told the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Observer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that when he found out there was a protest going on down the block, he had to be a part of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I live in the area and I have two sons, a 20-year-old and an 11-year-old,&quot; he said. &quot;I came here for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dhaka, Aug. 15 -- The US police in Missouri have clashed with protesters for a fourth night amid growing anger at the fatal shooting of a black teenager by police.Heavily armed riot police fired tear gas as they moved in on demonstrators in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson who had defied and used smoke bombs an order to disperse.Several people were arrested, two of them journalists who said they were assaulted before being released.The tension was sparked by the death of Michael Brown, 18, on Saturday.Details about the incident have been disputed but eyewitnesses said the unarmed teenager had his arms raised when he was shot multiple times by a police officer.Police say there was a struggle and the officer suffered facial injuries.Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post said they were handcuffed and put into a police van after officers came in to quickly clear the fast-food restaurant where they were doing some work. The Washington Post reported that Lowery said he was slammed against a soda machine and plastic cuffs were put on his wrists. Reilly told MSNBC that an officer slammed his head against the glass &quot;purposefully&quot; on the way out of the restaurant &quot;and then sarcastically apologized for it.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reporters were subsequently released without any charges. Martin D. Baron, The Washington Post's executive editor, issued a statement saying &quot;there was absolutely no justification&quot; for Lowery's arrest and said the organization was appalled by the officers' conduct.Ryan Grim, Washington, D.C., bureau chief for The Huffington Post, said in a statement that &quot;compared to some others who have come into contact with the police department, they came out relatively unscathed, but that in no way excuses the false arrest or the militant aggression toward these journalists.&quot;As the outrage showed no sign of dissipating, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said he would travel to the area on Thursday and called for &quot;patience and calm&quot; from members of the community. &quot;While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern,&quot; he wrote in a statement.&quot;I am committed to ensuring the pain of last weekend's tragedy does not continue to be compounded by this ongoing crisis.&quot;Of those young black men and women taking to the streets, many say they have no other outlet to show their objection - not just to the way Michael Brown died, but to the way the police treats them as a community - and that they will not stop protesting until they are listened to.While demonstrations throughout have been vociferous, for the most part they have been peaceful. They were again during the day on Wednesday. But after dark, police seemed intent on enforcing what had earlier been a request that &quot;all those wishing to demonstrate, disperse well before the evening hours&quot;.Tear gas was used and police lines swept through roads in the suburb of Ferguson that have been the focus of the confrontations.Requests for calm have come even from the White House, but there is a sense that the young people on the streets have the moral support of many among the older generations within their community here, who also see this as an opportunity for long overdue change.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shannon Bonds said she thought it would be more peaceful, when she moved to Los Angeles from Ferguson, Missouri. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-year-old singer said she left the city near St. Louis because she wanted to live in a more diverse area and get away from harassment from police for being black. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she heard that Michael Brown, 18, was shot to death by police in her hometown over the weekend, she said she was sad but unsurprised. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Monday, Ezell Ford, 24, was identified by family members as the man fatally shot after being stopped on a sidewalk by two Los Angeles Police Department officers near 65th Street and Broadway. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Brown and Ford were unarmed. Ford has been described as mentally disabled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford's death has sparked anger over differing accounts given by police and his family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been watching this kind of news on TV for days and it's eating me alive,&quot; Bonds said. &quot;We're here because we're tired of being targeted.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As demonstrators took to the streets in Ferguson. Mo., to voice their anger at police, on Thursday hundreds did the same at Leimert Plaza Park in South Los Angeles to honor of Ford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And across the country, thousands of people in more than 90 cites took part in protest vigils for Brown as part of a National Moment of Silence Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Los Angeles march was more peaceful that what had ensued in Missouri. They marched from the park down Crenshaw Boulevard for about five blocks with their hands raised, as if surrendering, many shouting &quot;Don't shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many, representing civil rights groups, said they'd had enough. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an emergency protest,&quot; said protest organizer Keith James, a member of a grassroots group Stop Mass Incarceration Network. &quot;This is to shine a spotlight on the egregious murder of Ford and others like him who are young and supposed to be the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford was walking on the sidewalk at around 8:10 p.m. Monday when two officers conducted an &quot;investigative stop&quot; according to a police statement. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials say a struggle ensued and Ford tried to grab an officer's gun at which point he was shot. Family members say Ford was on the ground and complying with officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the protest, many of the demonstrators arrived to the scene of the shooting on 65th Street near Broadway in the Florence neighborhood. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ezell's younger brother, Lavell Ford, 22, stood at a memorial set up on the sidewalk near the the site of the struggle. It was filled with candles, flowers and stuffed animals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lavell Ford said he didn't expect the arrival of the group of demonstrators but added he was grateful for their presence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My family appreciates the support,&quot; he said simply. &quot;We really do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few remaining protestors made their way to the LAPD 77th Street station. Some said they hoped police would listen to them and take responsibility for Ezell Ford's death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawyer said Thursday that he plans to file a wrongful death suit on behalf of the family of a black man who was fatally shot by two Los Angeles Police Department officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police, in a preliminary account, said a man, whom family and the attorney identified as 25-year-old  mentally challenged  Ezell Ford was shot about 8:10 p.m. Monday in South Los Angeles after he grabbed an officer and attempted to remove a gun from his holster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe the contact with my client s son unnecessarily led to an out-of-policy shooting, which is excessive force and forms the basis of a wrongful death claim ... pursuant to the basic civil rights statute,  said attorney Steven A. Lerman, who represented Rodney King. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday evening, hundreds turned out for a march along Broadway to demonstrate outrage over the shooting. Although tensions were high, with many expressing anger with police, the march remained peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators, carrying signs   many with  Don t shoot  written on them   and chanting  Justice for Ezell Ford. Justice for Michael Brown,  started at the scene of Monday s shooting on 65th Street, just east of Broadway, and headed to LAPD s 77th Street station and back, with LAPD blocking vehicles on Broadway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar demonstrations were held throughout the country to protest police killings, including that of Brown, an unarmed teen police fatally shot in Ferguson, Mo., with #NMOS14 , or National Moment of Silence 2014, being used on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Newton Area Gang Enforcement officers were driving westbound on 65th Street near Broadway when they came upon the man identified as Ford as he was walking on a sidewalk. When the officers attempted to stop him for unknown reasons, he turned, grabbed one of the officers and a struggle ensued, according to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After they fell to the ground and the man attempted to remove the officer s handgun from its holster, the officer s partner shot him  believing there was an imminent threat of danger  and then the officer on the ground  fired  his backup weapon, LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man who said he was Ezell Ford s brother said his brother  didn t deserve this.  He declined to comment further and wouldn t give his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the march, demonstrators lit candles and observed a moment of silence to honor Ford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lerman, who plans to file the wrongful death suit in federal court in the coming week, called the confrontation deadly and violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I can t see why a taser couldn t have been used or a bean bag gun, which the officers are equipped with,  he said.  I believe the officers knew this individual and knew he had mental problems. I believe that alone should have made them more aware of how to treat him properly so he doesn t end up dead on a sidewalk right by his house. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the medical record and witnesses in the neighborhood will attest that Ford was receiving medication for some mental issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lerman said he s hiring an investigative team made up of former law enforcement and FBI officials to probe the matter and to  offer proof in federal court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man, Leroy Hill, told the Huffington Post that he witnessed the incident. He said the officers were beating Ford and he didn t know why because  he didn t do nothing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident is being investigated by the LAPD s Force Investigation Division, with the inspector general and the district attorney monitoring the probe and ensuring it is complete and unbiased, said Tyler Izen, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If a suspect s behavior is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death, an officer can, by law and under LAPD policy, use deadly force,  Izen said in a statement.  In using deadly force, officers can fire their weapons only to stop deadly threats to keep themselves and the public safe, and can continue to fire until the threat has ended. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAPD is asking for any witnesses, including those who may have physical evidence such as video, to contact the department or the Office of the Inspector General. LAPD investigators have asked that the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner place an investigative hold on the pending autopsy report, according to a statement released Thursday night.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even before 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. - before Eric Garner died after New York City police officers put him in a choke hold - civil rights advocates were calling for police officers to wear cameras that record their interactions with the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's a policy, they say, that would protect people against police brutality and exonerate officers wrongfully accused of misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's a policy already in place in at least three major departments, and in the aftermath of Brown's and Garner's high-profile cases, calls for the cameras are gaining momentum. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it's a policy that Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey says he hopes to bring to Philadelphia. He says the department is in the early stages of planning a pilot program that he wants to launch by year's end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think it's the way to go,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it's something that's long overdue in our department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brown's death Saturday in Ferguson, a small suburb of St. Louis, touched off widespread anger and protests directed at local police, whose account of the shooting differs dramatically from several witness accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> St. Louis County police have said Brown pushed an officer into a patrol car and tried to grab an officer's weapon. A friend who was walking with Brown said the officer fired at the unarmed teen as he ran with his hands in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to news reports, Ferguson had recently received a grant to equip some police cars with dashboard cameras and some officers with body cameras. But the department, Ferguson's police chief has said, did not have the money to install the cameras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's unclear whether the officer who shot Brown would have been wearing a camera had those funds been available. But, proponents say, footage from body cameras can become invaluable evidence in investigations of alleged police misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The problem in so many of these cases is it's one word against the other,&quot; said David Rudovsky, a prominent Philadelphia civil rights lawyer. &quot;. . . Given how volatile some of these incidents can be - the choke hold in New York City, this recent shooting in St. Louis - it's much better to have verifiable facts than not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cameras offer an &quot;objective view of incidents that occur when stress levels are high and decision-making is quick&quot; - where both an officer's and a citizen's perspective of what happened could be distorted, said Sgt. Ali Pillow of the Cleveland Police Department, where 200 officers were recently equipped with body cameras that clip to the front of an officer's uniform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Proponents say the very presence of cameras can defuse a tense situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These cameras can prevent bad incidents from occurring because people naturally tend to behave better if they are being recorded,&quot; Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said in an e-mail. &quot;That includes officers as well as community members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organization - of which Ramsey serves as president - is set to release a set of guidelines for police departments interested in body cameras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group's studies of the cameras, researcher Craig Fischer said, show that they strengthen police accountability, prevent confrontational situations, resolve complaints against officers, and improve transparency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a 2012 study in Rialto, Calif., on a pilot body-camera program - in which certain shifts of officers were given cameras, and others were not - found that complaints against officers decreased by 89 percent and use-of-force incidents fell by nearly 60 percent in a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Shifts without cameras experienced twice as many incidents of use of force as shifts with cameras,&quot; the study said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PERF's research has found that cameras can also create some unrealistic expectations, Fischer said. In some cases, courts begin to expect that every encounter with the public is recorded and may suspect wrongdoing if not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And body-camera programs are expensive, he said. Each camera costs $800 to $1,200, and storage and administrative costs can run into the millions. One department of 900 officers reported the associated costs of the cameras at $2 million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Philadelphia has about 6,600 officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramsey said cost was a concern, but the department would do &quot;everything we can to try to outfit as many of our officers as possible,&quot; starting with patrol officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Philadelphia police union president John McNesby said he was against the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I would be opposed to [body cameras] because it would just give another avenue for them to second-guess police,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others say cities may be able to save money by deploying body cameras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York City Public Advocate Letitia James, in a report released this week calling for the New York Police Department to order body cameras, noted that the city spent $152 million in 2013 settling claims against the department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many complaints against the department, she wrote, &quot;suffered from a lack of information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;. . . The use of cameras is likely to save the city significant money and time while restoring confidence in NYPD,&quot; James wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 2009, Philadelphia has spent more than $45 million to settle lawsuits alleging civil rights violations by police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, payouts jumped from $8.3 million to nearly $14 million. Craig M. Straw, chief deputy city solicitor, said four seven-figure settlements accounted for the rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramsey said he hoped a body-camera program would have &quot;a positive impact in a variety of areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But &quot;in the short term, we've got to buy them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision to start a body-camera program should not be taken lightly, Wexler said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Departments should have guidelines for when the cameras should be turned on - for example, he said, officers should not record every single encounter with the public, so as not to violate the privacy of witnesses and victims, or deter citizens trying to help the police by providing information. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Community members may become reticent and avoid the police if they think they'll be recorded every time they say hello,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, experts say, departments should be prepared to properly oversee the program. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Department of Justice report released in April on the Albuquerque Police Department's use of force concluded that it had &quot;reacted hastily&quot; in its launch of the cameras, which it said &quot;appeared directed only at placating public criticism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investigators received many reports of officers failing to turn their cameras on, in some cases blaming the &quot;immediacy of the situation&quot; even when &quot;the officer had a clear opportunity to record the event,&quot; according to the report. And punishment for not turning a camera on, investigators found, was rare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramsey said that his department would work to set up guidelines for the use of body cameras but that more often than not, officers should have the camera on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;By and large, you have to restrict the circumstances of when an officer turns it off,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to make an assumption that it's going to be running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, working out those details won't deter the department from moving forward, he said: &quot;The technology is there and we need to take advantage of the technology.&quot; Guidelines On Body Cameras </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guidelines from the Police Executive Research Forum say cameras should be used during:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traffic stops</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arrests</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Searches</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interrogations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pursuits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Footage should be retained for: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 60 to 90 days in most cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indefinitely in homicides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Footage should be released to the public in accordance with state disclosure laws. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hundreds of people gathered Thursday night at LOVE Park for a moment of silence in response to the turmoil in Ferguson, Mo., that followed the shooting death by police of an unarmed black teen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protests have roiled the Midwestern community since Saturday's fatal shooting of Michael Brown, 18. The confrontation between police and protesters intensified Wednesday night, and the police were widely criticized for displaying an intimidating militarized presence and using overly aggressive tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In contrast, Philadelphia police officers kept their distance from the peaceful assembly in Center City, which also included a march up the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't want people to feel boxed in and intimidated,&quot; said Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan, explaining the light police presence. About 10 officers on bicycles were ready behind a nearby 7-Eleven just in case trouble erupted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Synthia Pullum, 24, of North Philadelphia, carried a sign that read &quot;Mike Brown&quot; and &quot;We Remember You&quot; and had a picture of Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm just sick and tired of hearing the same story over and over again,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't want another rally. I don't want another walk. Change must come.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joyce Hall, 55, went to LOVE Park with two cousins to participate in the moment of silence. She held a sign that had a photograph of her brother, three grandsons, and three nephews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It read: &quot;Don't shoot our men and boys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It seems like every other week, every week, there's another added to the list,&quot; Hall said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said she tells her grandchildren when they see a police officer, &quot;put your hands up,&quot; and don't move. &quot;If your nose itches, don't scratch it. They can kill you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As upset as she was with the police, she also expressed anger at the looters who took advantage of the unrest in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They need to all go to jail,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COUNTLESS PEOPLE have hoisted signs and chanted slogans at the top of their lungs on the streets of Philadelphia in recent years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their causes have varied - covering everything from income inequality to environmental concerns to overseas conflicts - but protesters in this city have all shared one thing in common: They didn't have to gag on billowing plumes of tear gas, or dodge rubber bullets that were fired by cops clad in military gear.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the world has watched in horror as protesters and reporters in the small town of Ferguson, Mo., have been met with those nightmarish conditions in the wake of a recent police-involved shooting that claimed the life of an unarmed, college-bound teen named Michael Brown.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have taken to social media to decry the militarized show of force that has confronted residents of Ferguson - the imposing armored vehicles, the snipers who trained rifles on unarmed civilians, the weaponry and gear that seem made for war. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, those images haven't been a part of recent demonstrations in Philly, not even during the sprawling Occupy Philly protests that took over Dilworth Plaza for two months in 2011. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one thing, the Philadelphia Police Department prefers to rely on bike cops and open lines of communication when dealing with crowds of protesters, police Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once you start pulling weapons out, it's already lost,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not trying to compare Occupy Philly to Ferguson, but they were here for 56 days. They had 42 marches, and we made 115 arrests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't use [pepper] spray or tear gas. We used the bike cops to keep everyone moving along, and we kept communicating with [Occupy's] leaders,&quot; said Sullivan, who oversees Homeland Security and the SWAT Unit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the department has also opted against splurging on sleek-looking military surplus equipment and vehicles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It sounds nice, but it's just not cost-effective,&quot; Sullivan said of retrofitting military vehicles for police use. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department owns two armored vehicles, which were purchased several years ago from a civilian company. The vehicles are supposed to be used to ferry cops into and out of dangerous situations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have any surprises. We can't shoot down any planes,&quot; Sullivan said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We get a better bang for our buck by spending money on things like training our officers and paramedics on how to respond to active-shooter situations.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery and Huffington Post reporter Ryan Reilly were arrested Wednesday night while covering the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, following Saturday's police shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. While eventually released, Mr. Lowery was detained for not packing his bag fast enough while being forced out of the McDonald's he was reporting from - and told by an officer to stop recording video of the encounter on his smartphone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington Post executive editor Martin Baron noted in his statement responding to the incident that the order to stop filming was illegal. Courts have held that, as a general rule, individuals have a right to record law enforcement officers carrying out their duties in public spaces. And, as the video archive of questionable police tactics from citizen observers grows, it's clear there's a certain benefit to keeping a digital eye on the police: Knowing there is a record of their actions can help put everyone on their best behavior, or provide evidence of misbehavior when it occurs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many police stations have long recorded at least some of their officers' interactions with the public, most frequently through dashboard cameras that capture traffic stops. Elsewhere in the world - such as Russia - car owners often purchase their own dashcams to gather evidence for insurance purposes and to record their interactions with the police and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's also a growing movement in the United States to have on-duty officers use body cameras to record their interactions with the public. Police officers in Rialto, California, started wearing cameras in February 2012. The result? The volume of complaints filed against officers fell by 88 percent compared with the previous year, and use of force by officers fell by almost 60 percent, according to a 2013 New York Times report. The tactic adds an extra layer of accountability for police actions and creates a record that officers can fall back on if their account differs from that of an arrestee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Laurel, Maryland, started using cameras on police officers last summer. A short time later, a federal judge ordered police officers in some New York precincts to use bodycams to monitor how they were enforcing the city's controversial stop-and-frisk program - something then-mayor Michael Bloomberg opposed, even though he was generally in favor of increased surveillance elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the American Civil Liberties Union, which typically raises the alarm over practices that potentially infringe on privacy, has endorsed the idea. &quot;Although we generally take a dim view of the proliferation of surveillance cameras in American life, police on-body cameras are different because of their potential to serve as a check against the abuse of power by police officers,&quot; the group wrote in a position paper last fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the ACLU did note the policy questions raised. Control over the actual device and its recordings is important, it argued: &quot;If the cameras do not record continuously, that would place them under officer control, which would create the danger that they could be manipulated by some officers, undermining their core purpose of detecting police misconduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACLU also suggests that video be deleted after a certain amount of time unless a recording has been flagged - and that period should be weeks, not years. There are other concerns, too, such as how to handle the recordings when officers enter a private residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As technology progresses, other new privacy concerns will no doubt be raised, such as the potential for facial recognition technology to be run against police bodycam footage to create a record of an individual's movements. But so far it seems like keeping a digital eye on the police can be a powerful tool for checking the power imbalance between citizens and law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of the Michael Brown shooting, much of the information we have comes from eyewitness accounts. If the police had an unedited video of the encounter, there would be little doubt about what occurred and perhaps accountability would be easier to achieve.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON: Missouri police fired tear gas and smoke bombs late yesterday at protesters demonstrating over the killing of an unarmed black teenager by an officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN and other media reported that police officers in riot gear marched toward the protesters near a burnt-out petrol station where demonstrators had gathered in|Ferguson, a St Louis suburb. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TV footage of the fifth straight day of unrest there showed thick clouds of smoke and protesters scurrying through it in the dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police also used sonic devices that make a loud ear-splitting sound to try to disperse the crowd, the |St Louis Post-Dispatch reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators taunted the police. &quot;We're not dogs, so what the hell you've got those whipping sticks for? Because you want to whip us like dogs,&quot; one protester said, according to the newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police separately arrested two journalists reporting on the unrest that has roiled Ferguson since aspiring college student Michael Brown, 18, died on Saturday in a police shooting. His death has triggered rioting and stirred comparisons with the February 2012 fatal shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wesley Lowery, a Washington Post political reporter, and Ryan Reilly, a Huffington Post reporter, were arrested in a McDonald's restaurant after police entered the restaurant and ordered people to leave, the pair wrote on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a series of tweets, Lowery said they were given no explanation for their arrest other than &quot;trespassing&quot;, and were not charged with any offences before being released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in Ferguson urged demonstrators to remain calm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    People in more than 90 cities observed Thursday's National Moment  of Silence. The vigils came in the wake of the shooting death of an  18-year-old man by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., and the death  of a New York City man caused by a police officer's chokehold.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rallies also were scheduled for the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, near  where Michael Brown was shot, and in Detroit and Los Angeles.  People were asked to wear a red ribbon, cloth or bandanna in a show  of solidarity.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Hackensack native Yemisi Miller-Tonnet was one of several leaders  of the moment-of-silence event in Washington, D.C.,  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;Having just four people show up to an event like this is just as  productive [as] having ...2,000 people,&quot; said Miller-Tonnet, 19.  &quot;It's still just as powerful as long as we don't return home after  the moment of silence and do nothing else about it. We have to go  further with it.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In North Jersey, The Gardens at Wyckoff on Crescent Avenue was the  spot for a sparsely attended event.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phillip Pannell. Lawrence Meyers. Amadou Diallo. Malik Williams.  Sean Bell. Eric Garner. And now, Michael Brown.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    All were black males, some from North Jersey, who died at the hands  of law enforcement officers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Civil rights advocates say such cases, from Pannell, a Teaneck teen  who was shot in 1990 while being chased by a white police officer,  to Brown, shot on Saturday by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.,  are examples of law enforcement's tendency to be overly aggressive  with black males.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Here is a look at some of the best-known cases of the past quarter  century:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * Phillip Pannell was shot to death by a white Teaneck police  officer 24 years ago.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The officer, Gary Spath, contended that Pannell, 16, had bolted  from an earlier stop-and-frisk in which his partner, Officer Wayne  Blanco, said he had felt a gun. Spath chased the fleeing Pannell  and said after the shooting that he thought Pannell, who had  stopped, was turning around and reaching for a gun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Spath fired two shots, the second hitting Pannell in the back and  killing him. Police said a gun was found in Pannell's jacket  pocket.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The shooting sparked demonstrations led by the Rev. Al Sharpton,  with hundreds of people bused from Brooklyn to add their voices to  those of people in Teaneck.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The protest ended with a night of unrest, in which cars - including  police cruisers - were overturned, windows broken and businesses  vandalized along Teaneck Road.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Spath, who was suspended with pay, was the subject of a grand jury  investigation which did not indict him, and a second inquiry, which  resulted in an indictment on manslaughter charges. He retired on  disability at the age of 31 a few months later and was acquitted of  manslaughter after a tense trial almost two years after the  shooting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * Amadou Diallo, an immigrant from Guinea, was hit with 19 bullets  fired by four New York City police officers before dawn on Feb. 4,  1999.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The officers thought Diallo fit the description of a man wanted for  a series of rapes. They said they identified themselves as they  approached Diallo. When Diallo reached into a pocket to pull out  his wallet, they opened fire. The officers said they feared he was  reaching for a gun. Diallo was unarmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    A grand jury indicted them on charges of second-degree murder and  reckless endangerment. A jury acquitted them. Diallo's family sued  the city and settled for $3 million.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * Malik Williams, 19, was fatally shot by Garfield police on Dec.  1, 2011. Police said he advanced on officers with a claw hammer and  handsaw after fleeing the station.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Williams had turned himself in on an aggravated-assault warrant but  ran out as he was being processed. He was cornered in a garage and  was holding a hammer and saw when he was shot by a Garfield officer  and a Bergen County officer, whom authorities said repeatedly  ordered him to drop the tools.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    A grand jury declined to indict the officers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * Manuel Loggins Jr. was a 31-year-old Marine sergeant and a father  of three when he was killed by an Orange County, Calif., sheriff's  deputy on Feb. 7, 2012. The deputy approached Loggins after Loggins  crashed through a gate of San Clemente High School about 4:40 a.m.,  with two of his daughters inside his SUV.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    According to the sheriff's department account, Loggins left the  vehicle, then returned to it, ignored orders to show his hands and  displayed a &quot;mean&quot; expression. The sheriff's deputy, who said he  feared for the girls' safety, fired three shots through the window.  He was not charged.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Loggins' family sued and settled for $4.4 million last spring.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * Ronald Madison was one of two victims of a New Orleans police  shooting in the days after Hurricane Katrina. Madison, 40, was  mentally disabled. He was unarmed when he was shot in the back on  Sept. 4, 2005. Madison and a 17-year-old named James Brissette were  killed. Four other people, all related, were wounded.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Prosecutors said the group was searching for food and supplies in  the wake of the hurricane. Authorities said a group of police  opened fire on the unarmed individuals and tried to cover up what  they had done by claiming they had been shot at.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Five New Orleans police officers pleaded guilty to obstructing  justice in connection with the cover-up. Another five were  convicted of civil rights violations and sentenced in 2012 to terms  ranging from six to 65 years.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * Sean Bell was due to be married the morning after his fatal  encounter with New York City police officers on Nov. 25, 2006.  Bell, 23, was behind the wheel of a car outside a Queens strip club  where his bachelor party had been held. Police, including  plainclothes officers who had been in the club, said they  approached Bell because of concerns that someone in his party had a  gun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Officers opened fire, saying Bell had rammed his car into one of  them. They said they had identified themselves as officers and  showed their badges, an account disputed by some witnesses in a  subsequent trial. Bell was shot in the neck and torso and died. Two  friends in his car were shot but survived.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Three police officers were indicted on charges ranging from  manslaughter to reckless endangerment. They were acquitted in 2008,  but all were fired or forced to resign after the Police Department  concluded they had acted improperly. A lawsuit filed by the  victims' families was settled for $7 million.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * Lawrence Meyers, a 16-year-old from Paterson, was fatally shot in  February 1995 by Ronald Cohen, a 25-year-old white rookie Paterson  cop, during a buy-and-bust drug operation on Ellison Street.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Cohen, who was working undercover, had pinned Meyers against a  fence and had his gun drawn as he was doing a pat-down search. The  gun went off, and a bullet struck Meyers in the head, killing him.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The shooting led to three days of demonstrations, one of which was  accompanied by looting downtown near City Hall. Months later, Cohen  was cleared of any wrongdoing by a grand jury and reinstated. But  under community pressure, he was given a desk job and soon resigned  from the department.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * Eric Garner, 43, died on July 17, after a police officer in  Staten Island placed him in an illegal chokehold during an  encounter on the sidewalk, where police said Garner was selling  illegal cigarettes. A bystander shot video showing Garner's final  moments, and it quickly fueled major protests and demands that the  officers involved face criminal charges.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The city's medical examiner ruled Garner's death a homicide because  of the compression of his neck and chest. Two officers face an  internal investigation in connection with Garner's death. The one  who applied the chokehold was put on modified duty, meaning he was  stripped of his gun and badge.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Neither has been charged, and police say Garner's poor health and  his refusal to cooperate with officers contributed to his death.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MICHAEL BROWN is Trayvon Martin, Amadou Diallo and Rodney King. He  is not me. There is no way to talk about race in America without  acknowledging that as a white, middle-class, middle-aged man, race  is merely a conversation for me; if I were a black, it would be my  life, and perhaps my death.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Ferguson, Mo., a place of 21,000 residents, with a majority black  population and a minority white population that dominates municipal  government and the Police Department, has been thrust into the  national spotlight in the wake of Brown's death Saturday. The  18-year-old man was killed by a cop, who according to witnesses is  white. An Internet hacking organization has posted the name of the  police officer, but his identity has not been confirmed or released  by local police or mainstream media.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The facts are limited: Brown was unarmed. Some claim he had his  hands up, indicating not to shoot. Others say he physically  threatened a police officer. No one disputes that he was without a  weapon or that he is now most definitely dead.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In the days following the shooting, Ferguson officials have done  just about everything right if you want to ensure that heated  emotions explode into flames. Demonstrations have turned violent,  buildings burned, and the police response captured on video appears  excessive. Not being on scene, it is impossible to know what level  of force is appropriate. But Ferguson is a powder keg exploding  nightly on the news.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Thursday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon called for calm. Watching Nixon  on CNN speak inside what looked like a church setting, I realized  why the likes of Chris Christie and Andrew Cuomo dominate the  universe of U.S. governors. Nixon rambled in a folksy style that  might have been good for a mall manager planning the holiday  display, but it was less than reassuring from a chief executive in  the midst of a major crisis.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    President Obama addressed the issue from Martha's Vineyard, Mass.,  where he is vacationing. He called for calm and respect. He stood  up for journalists -- two were arrested in Ferguson at a  McDonald's. And he said federal officials will investigate Brown's  death.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Obama did not speak about race, which was a missed opportunity. No  one should glorify Brown at this point. Whether he was a threat to  police is unknown. But even if he was, the use of deadly force  needs to be explained. And the days of fire and looting need to be  addressed and the persons responsible brought to justice.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    There is no excuse for vandalism, looting and arson. There is no  excuse for excessive police force. But we do have centuries of  excuses for why it all happens again and again. Perhaps that it is  now happening in the heartland, as Obama noted, or in a state whose  very entry into the Union almost propelled the nation to civil war  40 years before the firing at Fort Sumter, is more than an  accident, but rather an inevitability.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    My experience in life, having lived in Detroit when it was quiet  and Los Angeles when it burned as mobs chanted &quot;No justice, no  peace&quot; after the acquittal of the police officers charged in the  beating of Rodney King, is that generally the only people who think  there is no race problem in America are white. And for most of us,  there truly is no problem. No one stops us for looking too pale in  an upscale boutique or driving an expensive car.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Brown may have provoked police. I do not know. But I do not think  he should be dead.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Rodney King was never a model citizen. But he should not have been  savagely beaten by a group of officers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The violence that followed the King acquittals and the Brown  shooting are not excusable, but they are explainable. These are  human earthquakes. Heat, tension and pressure build up, and at some  point at predictable locations but unpredictable times, earth  shifts and swallows and crushes everything above it. We measure  quakes on the Richter scale; riots by whether they generate their  own logo and special on CNN and Fox.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Ferguson officials are ill-equipped for the crisis in their town  and the ensuing national attention. They will be overrun by federal  officials, national media and a parade of activists who may have  agendas greater than the well-being of the residents of Ferguson.  That is the nature of how we handle crisis in modern America. I  expect there will be drastic changes in how policing is conducted.  The mayor of Ferguson may find it harder to get elected next term;  so may the governor of Missouri -- if either man intends to remain  in his current office. There may be a shakeup in the Police  Department.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    There were changes in Los Angeles after the King riots and changes  in New York City after Amadou Diallo. And yet just last month, Eric  Garner died after being put in a chokehold by an NYPD officer.  Sometimes I wonder if America can ever get past the issue of race,  if the sins of our Founding Fathers will ever be expunged from our  collective national soul.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Maybe we are a nation with too much historical baggage and too many  carpetbaggers to get to a place where the influx of black families  doesn't signal an exodus of white ones, or where an angry black man  looks identical to an angry white man.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    People say we have come so far. We have an African-American  president who no longer is asked to produce his U.S. birth  certificate five years into presidency. Maybe we have come far.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Or maybe, after so much journeying, we are standing on the streets  of Ferguson, Mo.  </SPAN></P>
