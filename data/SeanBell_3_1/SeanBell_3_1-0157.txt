THREE detectives were acquitted yesterday after shooting dead a 23-year-old man in a hail of 50 bullets. 
Unarmed black victim 
 who was celebrating his stag night, died outside a New York strip club hours before his wedding in 2006.
Gescard Isnora, 29, and Michael Oliver, 36, had faced 25 years in jail on manslaughter charges, while Marc Cooper, 40, faced a year's sentence for reckless endangerment.
But Judge Arthur Cooperman, sitting without a jury, cleared all three.
The Queens courtroom was packed for the high profile case and some of the 200 people outside shouted "murderers" at the acquitted officers.
The defence maintained Bell was "out of control" and was overheard asking someone to "go get my gat", slang for gun. No gun was ever found.
