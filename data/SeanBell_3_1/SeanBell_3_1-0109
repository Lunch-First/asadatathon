<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- The fiancee of an unarmed black man shot dead by police on his wedding day said the justice system ``let me down'' by acquitting the three detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slaying fuelled allegations of racism and excessive force by police, although two of the officers charged were black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``They killed Sean all over again,'' Nicole Paultre Bell said. ``That's what it felt like to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I'm still praying for justice, because it's not over.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives of the victims have sued the city, and the officers also face possible departmental charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Bell stormed out of court after the NYPD detectives were cleared of charges over 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killing in a hail of 50 gunshots outside a Queens strip club in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, more than 300 people marched through Harlem; 50 carried white placards bearing numbers for the shots fired at Mr Bell and his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev Al Sharpton lambasted the judge who acquitted the detectives, saying a jury should have decided. He's threatened to ``shut the city down''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman said inconsistent evidence, the demeanour and rap sheets of the prosecution witnesses -- mainly Mr Bell's friends -- ``had the effect of eviscerating'' their credibility. None of the officers took the stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Michael Oliver, who fired 31 shots, wept as did Mr Bell's mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shouts of ``Murderers! Murderers!'' and ``KKK!'' rang out outside court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell was killed as he left his bachelor party. The undercover cops said they thought one man had a gun; no gun was found.</SPAN></P>
