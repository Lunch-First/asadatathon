<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REBUFFED BY ONE WOMAN, a lovelorn student took another coed hostage at City College yesterday and held a gun to her head in a crowded waiting room, cops said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said if anybody moves he'll kill me,&quot; the hostage, Elaishun Martin, 21, told the Daily News. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The harrowing incident unfolded just after 2 p.m. when the suspect, Kirk Hanley, 21, got into an argument with a 20-year-old woman who rejected him for a date, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman became frightened by Hanley's reaction and went to the Wille Administration Building on the Harlem campus, where she works in the financial aid office. She alerted a counselor, who contacted campus security. Campus officers called the NYPD for assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security officers confronted Hanley in a waiting room outside the financial aid office, asking him to leave with them, campus spokeswoman Mary Lou Edmondson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said Hanley became agitated, pulled a pistol from his book bag and randomly grabbed Martin by her hair, pointing the gun at her head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, a psychology student, said Hanley muttered something about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> police shooting case and yelled at the arriving NYPD cops, &quot;Are you going to make me do this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communications student Johnny Ochoa, 19, said Hanley kept repeating, &quot; 'I've been waiting 21 years. All I needed was help.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops ordered the 15 to 20 students in the area to hit the floor, said Ahmed Ishtiak, 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It happened so suddenly, in a second,&quot; Ishtiak said. &quot;Everyone was running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Hanley, of Flatbush, Brooklyn, released Martin, but did not immediately follow orders to lay down his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was just walking around and he put the gun to his head,&quot; said Ishtiak, adding that Hanley was yelling, &quot;I don't want to live anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops screamed at Hanley, &quot;Drop the gun and no one will hurt you.&quot; When Hanley dropped the weapon, police tackled him and dragged him out of the building, witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Hanley's weapon turned out to be pellet gun that looked like a real .45-caliber pistol. Cops said Hanley had a suicide note in his pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was taken to the psychiatric ward at St. Luke's Hospital for observation. Cops later charged him with criminal possession of a weapon, reckless endangerment and kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not supposed to be at work and receive a phone call like this,&quot; Martin's mother, Helen Martin of Harlem, told The News last night as she emerged from the 26th Precinct stationhouse with her daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A friend of Hanley's, who requested anonymity, said the suspect seemed normal when he spoke to him last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had a lot of questions about the military. He wanted to be a cop,&quot; said the friend, who was recently discharged from the Army. &quot;He's a normal kid. I'm shocked. Kirk just needs some help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
