<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OUR chests swell with pride each time Barack Obama speaks of hope. He could be president, we tell ourselves - the change Sam Cooke sang can soon be real.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's a reality check, and it smacks us in the face.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, go ahead, anoint this new black savior. That won't mean your brothers and sons will be safe when they drive at night.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make all the history you want. That doesn't mean a cop's bullet - or 50 for that matter - will be any less discriminating.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's inspiring to see Obama at the edge of glory. And if a verdict like the one from Queens doesn't inspire black people to vote, nothing else will.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how far have we come really in the face of an insult like this?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What could President Obama say about a country in which a black actor can get three years in prison on a misdemeanor tax charge, but black victims can't get any measure of justice for a state-sanctioned execution?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As news helicopters hovered yesterday above the grave where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lay, it was hard to imagine a different world, even with an Obama.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do you hope when the system gives police yet another license to kill?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do you dream when a judge says a life isn't worth even one conviction?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that isn't at least reckless, then nothing is. Ever.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, against all this, we vote for change and maintain what Obama calls the audacity of hope. One day, it will be even stronger than the power to acquit.  </SPAN></P>
