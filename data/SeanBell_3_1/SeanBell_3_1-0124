<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was no surprise that it resulted in a 2-0 win for opponents Chris Taylor and Mark Thompson (Halfway A).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next came the final of the Executive competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The holders of the trophy, Halfway Gents, won the opening game thanks to Anthony Hall but the scores were levelled when Eric Silcock (RAOB Buffs) won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response for the latter proved to be shortlived, however, for Halfway Gents then took the next four games to put them into an unassailable 5-1 lead with wins from Steve McKay, Brian Whitby, Paul Edwards and Karl Whitfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Ellis then won for RAOB Buffs but the last two games went in favour of Halfway Gents with wins from Peter Bellfield and Keith Massey to make the final score 7-2.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first leg in the second semi final went in favour of Adie Heathcote (Navvy), but the scores were tied when with the aid of a maximum Steve Shackleton (Tricorn) took the second leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a tense decider, it was Adie who hit the all-important finishing double and so progressed to the final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These semi finals were followed by the final of the Town Championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roundhouse set the early running when they won the first three games with wins from Keith Worthington, Mike Hassey and John Glover, but Tricorn hit back in fine style when they took the next five games to make certain of the championship with wins from Neil Connor, Steve Shackleton, Steve Roberts, Ian King and Dave Roberts.</SPAN></P>
