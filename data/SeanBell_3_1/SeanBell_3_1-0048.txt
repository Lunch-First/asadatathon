THE KALUA CABARET, the seedy strip joint where 
 was celebrating on the eve of his wedding, will stay closed through most of the day today because of fears of violence after the verdict. 
Normal business hours at the south Jamaica, Queens, dive are from 4 p.m. to 4 a.m., but doors won't open today until 10 p.m., a manager said.
"We're waiting to see what happens with the trial," a manager who declined to give his name said yesterday.
Another employee at the club said management was worried a verdict favoring the three cops on trial would send angry protesters to the site where undercover police encountered Bell after his bachelor party.
