<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three US detectives were acquitted of all charges yesterday in the 50-shot killing of an unarmed groom-to-be on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman delivered the verdict in a New York courtroom packed with spectators including victim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fiancee and parents, and at least 200 people gathered outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell's fiancee immediately walked out of the room; his mother cried and gasps were heard throughout the room. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shouts of &quot;No!&quot; and &quot;Not guilty!&quot; erupted outside the court and dozens of people began crying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, a 23-year-old black man, was killed in a hail of gunfire outside a strip club in Queens on November 25 2006 - his wedding day - as he was leaving his stag party with two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers Michael Oliver (36) and Gescard Isnora (29) stood trial for manslaughter while Officer Marc Cooper (40) was charged only with reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver fired 31 shots, Isnora fired 11 rounds and Cooper shot four times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge indicated that the police officers' version of events was more credible than the victims' version.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A conviction on manslaughter could have brought up to 25 years in prison; the penalty for reckless endangerment, is a year behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell's fiancee, parents and their supporters have held rallies demanding that the officers - two of whom are black - be held accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence painted the victims as drunken thugs who the officers believed were armed and dangerous. Prosecutors sought to convince the judge that the victims had been minding their own business and that the officers were inept, trigger-happy aggressors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the officers took the witness stand. Instead, Justice Cooperman heard transcripts of the officers testifying, saying they believed they had good reason to use deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge also heard testimony from Mr Bell's companions - Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman - who insisted the incident erupted without warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Benefield and Mr Guzman were both wounded - Mr Guzman still has four bullets lodged in his body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victims and defendants were set on a fateful collision course by a pair of innocuous decisions: Mr Bell's to have a last-minute stag party at Kalua Cabaret, and the undercover detectives' to investigate reports of prostitution at the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the club closed around 4am, Sanchez and Isnora claimed they overheard Mr Bell and his friends first flirt with women, then taunt a stranger who responded by putting his right hand in his pocket as if he had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Guzman, they testified, said: &quot;Yo, go get my gun&quot; - something Mr Bell's friends denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora said he decided to arm himself, call for backup and tail the trio as they went around the corner and got into Mr Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed that after warning the men to halt, Mr Bell pulled away and rammed an unmarked police van with Oliver at the wheel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detective also alleged that Mr Guzman made a sudden move as if he were reaching for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With tyres screeching, glass breaking and bullets flying, the officers claimed that they believed they were the ones under fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver responded by emptying his semiautomatic pistol, reloading, and emptying it again, as the supervisor dived for cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth emerged when the smoke cleared - there was no weapon inside Mr Bell's blood-splattered car.</SPAN></P>
