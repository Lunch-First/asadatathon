<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first time House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers came to New York to hector cops, it was 1984.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He returned Monday, after the acquittal of three city detectives in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, to again cast a gimlet eye on the men and women in blue.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intervening 24 years saw the Diallo and Bell cases, among others where New Yorkers died in arguably preventable confrontations with the police.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also over that time, exactly 100 members of the New York City Police Department were murdered in the line of duty.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a powerful number.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cite it not to excuse whatever errors of training or judgment occurred in the Bell tragedy - again, a judge disposed of the criminal charges - but to add context to the continuing debate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conyers' 1984 visit was part of a 17-month inquiry into what the then-chairman of the House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice termed racism and police brutality here and in other big cities.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing much came of that probe, and no surprise there - then (as now) Conyers' concerns had a certain rhetorical resonance, but not much substance.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One hundred murdered police officers, on the other hand, is a very substantial number indeed.  </SPAN></P>
