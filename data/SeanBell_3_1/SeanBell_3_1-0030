<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFTER 17 MONTHS of silence, the three cops in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case spoke publicly for the first time yesterday - but only one of them apologized to the victim's family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His voice cracking slightly, an emotional Detective Marc Cooper began a brief, halting statement with an act of contrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,&quot; said Cooper, who fired four bullets in the 50-shot barrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, like co-defendants Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora, who spoke before him, Cooper, 40, thanked those who stood by him after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to thank the Lord, my savior, for today,&quot; he added, appearing on the verge of tears. &quot;This started my life back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora, 29, and Oliver, 36, praised Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman for his acquittal of the trio on all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First and foremost, I'd like to thank the Lord Jesus Christ for bringing this all to fruition,&quot; said Isnora, who fired 11 shots outside the Kalua Cabaret strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secondly for the honorable Judge Cooperman for his fair and accurate decision today, and lastly for my family and friends for their support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, who has been the focus of outrage because he fired 31 shots, thanked Cooperman &quot;for making a fair and just decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His relatives gathered at a home in Clifton, N.J., where one gleefully told a neighbor, &quot;He's been cleared on all counts!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our prayers have been answered,&quot; a cousin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver and his fellow detectives didn't take questions at the press conference organized by the Detectives' Endowment Association, or discuss specifics of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was left to DEA President Michael Palladino, who analyzed the evidence, ripped Bell's two friends who were wounded in the shooting, and piled scorn on the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do I spell relief? N-O-T G-U-I-L-T-Y,&quot; Palladino said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our sympathies go out to the Bell family,&quot; he said. &quot;We have been portrayed as insensitive murderers and I can tell you that we are not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palladino displayed no sympathy for Bell's pals Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, both of whom testified against the detectives. Palladino cited Benefield's shifting account of the shooting as the &quot;turning point&quot; in the trial, accusing him of lying to bolster a civil suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He transformed from a victim into a businessman,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectives also were helped by Guzman's performance on the stand, Palladino said. &quot;He was arrogant. He was belligerent. And he was combative,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although they've escaped state prison sentences, the cops' futures are cloudy. They face a possible federal civil rights investigation, a civil suit and an NYPD probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, Cooper and Isnora are on modified duty, stripped of their guns. Sources say it's unlikely they'll ever patrol the streets again, and the stain of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case may stay with them for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Isnora's Bushwick neighborhood, some residents were angry he wasn't convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should put 'Murderer' on his door,&quot; said Pablo Rios, 41.</SPAN></P>
