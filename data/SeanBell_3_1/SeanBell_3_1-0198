</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think that somebody has messed up on the size of the print in the Sun-News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only the Sun-News would put a woman smoking a cigar, puffing like a train, instead of covering a story like the annual March of Dimes walk. What a shame!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The price of gas is determined by supply and demand. Doing away with the tax on gas will not lower the price on gas, it will only increase the profits to the oil companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, we can shoot off rockets, but we can't shoot off our fireworks!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your new format that started today, I appreciate your return of &quot;Hocus Pocus,&quot; the little picture, and I really like the arrangement on the comic page. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Disgruntled employees?&quot; That's NMSU-speak for employees that file complaints against their administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter which one of the three presidential candidates wins now, the Republicans lose, because the one they really wanted in there was Giuliani and he had no values, or had no values. So McCain may possibly be the winner, but the Republicans lose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just wanted to say &quot;thank you&quot; for moving the crossword above the fold and for enlarging it. Finally, someone who understood those holes at the bottom of the page made the crossword more difficult to do. Thank you again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the callers to this column prefers Hillary, who reputedly has temper tantrums and throws dishes in the White House, to John McCain, whom she calls a warmonger for dropping bombs. As I recall, the only bombs McCain dropped were during the Vietnam War. It's a rather skewed view to refer to this as a temper tantrum, since he did this under the orders of his commander in chief, Democrat President Lyndon Baines Johnson, for which McCain spent five-and-a-half years in the Hanoi Hilton. But perhaps if Hillary was throwing dishes at Bill   and I recall he did some things in the White House which may have brought on her tantrum   this could mean she can at least recognize the face of the enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm calling about the article in Sunday's, April 27, issue of the Sun-News. How in the world did somebody get a big headline that says, &quot;Do&ntilde;a Ana gets new community center,&quot; when in fact it was Organ. It's not Do&ntilde;a Ana! Is the newspaper going to print a retraction?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your comments on what's going on at Gadsden Middle School, a couple of questions: Where is the union on this issue? Why are the teachers still working? Why don't you just stick together and walk off? And where are the parents? Why aren't the parents doing something if their kids are in danger? All these calls to the Sound Off! make no sense if nothing's getting done. Why don't you people show some backbone and do something yourself, the teachers and the parents? Do something drastic to get the attention of the public and the superintendent and the school board. Otherwise, stop whining!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have a paper-saving suggestion. Since you (print) the Sunday crossword puzzle so small that's it's illegible, why don't you just eliminate it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everybody's worried about gas prices, the economy, all of that. Well, you know, Americans can make small changes that really save them money and benefit them. Number one, stop buying Cokes, potato chips, all the junk food, cookies. Start eating more at home, making your meals from scratch. There are so many things you can do. This panic over $3 gas, $4 gas, you guys better learn to deal with it, because it ain't going any lower. In Europe, they pay $8 a gallon. Think about it! There are lots of ways in your life that you can save money, live better and benefit the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This comment is for Police Chief Harry Romero. You need to tell your Codes officers that they're not police officers. They're leaving themselves wide open for a lawsuit. They cannot go around touching people or pushing people around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think Richardson is down in Venezuela making some deal with Chavez to broker a deal to rescue the people held hostage there to make himself look good so somebody will select him as vice president. He says he's acting as a private citizen, not as a representative of our government, so what could he possibly offer Chavez? Maybe some favor in the future if he does become vice president? This whole thing sounds fishy to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have a barking dog that barks and wakes me up every morning at 4 o'clock in the morning once they let the dog out of the house. I've talked to Codes, and they said they couldn't do nothing about it because I would have to get three witnesses, and they couldn't put muzzles on a dog. They talked to the people, but they couldn't do nothing about it. Can you guys give me an answer?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope all these people that are getting rebate checks this year realize that it's coming out of their taxes next year, so you're not really getting anything for free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would not surprise me if we learned someday that Hillary Clinton is staying in the presidential race in order to collect more money. I've heard she spends other people's money lavishly, but is a miser with her own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have serious doubts that any Las Cruces Police Department officer would try to arrest a man for calling a woman a &quot;bitch&quot; in a parking lot. I imagine that he probably got out of his vehicle and started an altercation. He still couldn't be arrested if he didn't touch the woman, but I'm sure he probably got in the cop's face. Otherwise, they wouldn't have reacted to that because they would know that it would put them into a lawsuit situation. So, I'm sure the guy was aggravating the situation and causing much more of a problem than your article would lead us to believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have any of you people who coughed your way through the Sunday (April 27) performance of &quot;CATS&quot; ever heard of throat lozenges?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you watched KFOX News at 9 on Sunday (April 27), you would understand why the developers around here are still trying to get people to buy these houses with offers like &quot;$250 gets you in this home today.&quot; They're having a hard time paying their mortgages on the lots that they want to build on, so now they're just anxious to sell anything that's completed so they can get some capital so they can pay for their other lots that they want to develop, because no one wants to buy these lots from them now. So those people that think there's nothing wrong with the housing market here, think again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that somebody doesn't really know New York or those of us who are from New York very well. Those police officers that were acquitted in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, that's only the tip of the iceberg. There are more court cases to come, there is a Citizens Review Board in New York. They may have been acquitted on this first round, but that was only because of conflicting testimony from witnesses. The judge had no choice in this case. However, the future cases that are coming up against them, they're not going to win. So they will be brought to task for what they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recycling is very important for the environment. I don't think it would be very hard for our city fathers to put up a couple more bins at local sites so people can recycle plastics and office paper without driving all the way over on Amador to the city recycling drop-off place. And how about glass? We need to recycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, we're not worth new Sound Off!s again. Great way to start off the week. Thanks a lot, Sun-News, we just get a bunch of repeats again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of people shop at Save Mart Foods at Valley Drive. The new bus route stops on the other side of the street from Save Mart now. Not only is this a safety hazard, but it's unfair to one of our fine, local merchants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have a question for Walt Rubel and all the other muckrakers who continue to blather on about New Mexico State. In the first place, the pornography issue should have been taken care of promptly, but in the second place, why haven't the two fired professors decided to file litigation against the university? Have you thought about that? I suspect it's because they don't want anybody to know why they were released, and the university is not obligated   unless they would have to go to court   to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday (April 26) evening, my wife and me dined at our favorite restaurant. We didn't have to make reservations. In fact, we didn't even have to wait for a table. The Republican's high price of gasoline is now taking its toll on our local businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm calling about the newspaper today. You can't even read the newspaper. They ruined it, and the classifieds are so small nobody could read that. Please, put the paper back like it was or reduce the price of the paper to match the price of the print, and we'll get the paper for free!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course Bill McCamley wants to support shooting off fireworks. That way everyone can celebrate the tax increases he wants to give us. Way to go!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any person who would kill a 5-week-old baby, or for that matter any child, needs to be put to death   nothing more, nothing less   because they've lost their right to live in a civilized society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems to me that children are being abused in Texas, but not by their mothers, by the Texas Department of Family and Children Services, and a frightening judge named Barbara Walther. There are many ugly and frightening things about Texas politics. She is an elected judge. We see completely that this system of finding judges must be stopped. Small children   no charges have been made that they're being abused by their parents. Why are they being removed? They'll be scarred for life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I was a kid growing up, we always had big firecrackers and played with them and stuff like that. But when I was in the service in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, us young boys was playing with firecrackers around a drive-in theater on a holiday, and one of them throwed a firecracker at a girl and it hit her right in the face and blowed her eye out. I haven't wanted a firecracker around me since, and I don't believe they should be sold in this town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corn is not the only source for ethanol and biofuels. Ethanol can be made, it has been discovered, from landfill material and many other sources. The reason why they're focusing on corn, I believe it's the oil companies! They want people to be against ethanol because it's raising food prices, so they're trying to convince people that corn is the only source and that we need to use all the corn for ethanol, thus raising all the prices, when in truth we don't even need the corn for ethanol production. The oil companies are just trying to put another one over on us and bamboozle us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to thank the person that found my payment for Home Depot and took it to the store for me. Thank you, Lord. Amen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll bet there are two people in the whole staff there who could satisfactorily define a carbon footprint, and yet you use this ambiguous phrase to justify cutting down on the size of the newspaper. I have a better idea: Drop down to 4-point type, publish once a week and make it about magazine size, about the size of the Reader's Digest. That would reduce your carbon footprint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever happened to the noise pollution laws in Las Cruces? Talk about sirens...why are they so loud? Why can't you just tone them down a bit? This isn't a big city, this is a small town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have DirecTV and late Friday (April 25) afternoon, quite late Friday afternoon, I called up DirecTV customer service because I needed a new remote. Mine wasn't working as well as it should. By 11 o'clock this morning, Monday (April 28) morning, FedEx had already delivered my new remote, completely free of any charge to me. I was just wondering if you Comcast customers can say the same about Comcast service?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am so tired of people saying that if you don't support the ideology of the current administration you are unpatriotic, if you don't support the war in Iraq you are unpatriotic, and there are many other similar examples. I ask you, is it patriotic to support that which is detrimental to the United States? Isn't true patriotism a desire to do what is best for the country? I agree wholeheartedly with Thomas Jefferson, who said, &quot;Dissension is the greatest form of patriotism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's so wonderful what the mayors are doing for the Red Cross. With the popularity and character of mayors like Michael Cadena of Mesilla, they should sell well over 900 tickets. Thanks for caring about the Red Cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your online poll asks if we should build the border fence. I say we shouldn't only build a border fence, we should electrify it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding your new format and microscopic type font, my subscription check will be reduced in size proportionately to your type font until we decide to just cancel altogether, because this really sucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is concerning everyone who is complaining in the neighborhood of Country Club Circle about people running businesses out of their homes. Do they have nothing else to do than complain about something that is not true? There's no businesses being run. All it is is somebody that wants to complain and has nothing else better to do with their time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is another one about the illegals. They are working in the schools, teaching your kids. As long as they can speak good English, they automatically are hired, and the same way with the ones getting welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry Teague is trying to buy the CD 2 election. Today, he just wrote himself a check for $475,000, but he won't even agree to debate Bill McCamley even once in this coming month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, I got it. In real life, the gross receipts taxes and growth is the only thing that pays government's checks and the revenue's important for the city to continue all of its services. So now they're going to approve all of the subdivisions and they're just going to call them &quot;green&quot; subdivisions. So now that the annexation and the subdivisions and the zoning is called &quot;green&quot; subdivisions, &quot;green&quot; annexations and &quot;green&quot; zoning, everything will be passed and everybody will be happy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem with this epidemic diabetes is the number of miscarriages and birth defects for women with this disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hate to see a good kid like Miley Cyrus turned into a sleazy vamp by her advisors, parents or whoever. Do all kids have to be pimps and whores nowadays? Satan is ruling the planet, folks, and it isn't getting any better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Education as a cabinet-level department that shouldn't even exist on the federal level, that's an idea that I could not more wholeheartedly agree with, because I believe there is a correlation between federal meddling in education and the degradation of it to the point that the people cannot even recognize Obama and most of his party for the socialists they are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LC Sun-News could save paper if they would stop delivering the daily paper which we canceled nearly three weeks ago!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks for the two wonderful articles by area residents, Michael Hayes and Thomas Wark. I like reasoned, intelligent writing. The world needs more of it, and I'm glad to know there's some of it right here. It gives me hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, I certainly did notice several things different in today's newspaper. Didn't much care for them. The SU/DO/KU and the Cryptoquip are large enough that a legally blind person could read them. The Bridge column was so small that a magnifying glass was needed to read it. My suggestion is that you put smaller pictures of sports events in the paper and there would be room for bigger print where needed. I would also like to suggest that the news of sporting events be put in the Sports section where they belong and not on the front page. You have not improved our newspaper in the least.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the April 20 edition of the Sun-News, County Commissioner Bill McCamley wrote the county is losing $90,000 in GRT revenue every year without year-round fireworks sales. At the current county GRT rate (.9375 percent), it would take fireworks sales of $9.6 million to generate $90,000 of county GRT revenue. This means the fireworks vendors would be selling over $26,000 worth of fireworks every day, seven days a week for 365 days. I don't believe it and think McCamley is deceiving the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can't believe that Steve Pearce thinks we are going to elect him to the Senate after he spent his time in Congress supporting Cheney and Big Oil at every turn and on every vote. He was even stronger then Bush in his denial that global warming existed. No Steve, even with oil the lobbyists filling your campaign chest, we won't let it happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city does not need to charge any extra fees, just audit the Bantam Weight Sports program and hold them responsible for all the money they collect every year for registration and operating the concession stands. They collect a lot of money and are not held accountable for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gas prices only spiked, oil prices only spiked when the Democrats took over Congress in 2007. How about that folks? It's a world economy. There are millions of new drivers in India and China. Guess what? They want to be like us Americans. Everybody envies our lifestyles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You all have published a lot of negative stuff about Harry Teague. Please publish the following comment: Someone recently wrote Harry Teague did not give Al Kissling money. Look at the FEC reports. On April 21, 2006, a check was cashed for $250. On top of that, FEC reports show Harry Teague has given over $50,000 to Democrats in the past seven years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the American population gets older, many publishers are beginning to use a larger print in their publications to offset failing eyesight. What does the Sun-News do? Shrink the typeset which they use. This is almost as bad a decision as when you endorsed George Bush for President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Mexico's driver's licenses may be more secure from identity thieves but, it is useless as identification for anything else. Why? Because New Mexico gives driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, and so, like New York, less and less places are going to accept them as a valid form of identification, i.e. for airline flights etc. And oh, by the way, many illegals are being arrested by the Border Patrol at local checkpoints because they are traveling to New Mexico from all over the country to get driver's licenses here.</SPAN></P>
