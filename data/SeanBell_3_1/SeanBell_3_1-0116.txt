The judge at the center of the 
 trial has said all he plans to say about the subject - unless you happen to catch him at the courthouse.   
State Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman, who acquitted three cops in the shooting death of an unarmed bridegroom, said he wouldn't answer any questions about the case on his own time.  
"He said the pool press people will talk to him from 9 to 5," said an officer at the judge's Queens house. "He doesn't want anyone on his property."  
Patrol cars have been guarding the judge's house since Cooperman announced his verdict on Friday.  
Cooperman, 74, said prosecution witnesses gave inconsistent statements and said some of the testimony "just didn't make sense." The trial lasted nearly two months.  
The defendants, Detectives Marc Cooper, Gescard Isnora and Michael Oliver waived their right to a jury trial, deciding instead to let Cooperman alone decide their fate.
