<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A coalition of civil-rights advocates called yesterday for the creation of a permanent state special prosecutor to investigate suspected cases of police misconduct and brutality.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, which includes Norman Siegel, former head of the New York Civil Liberties Union, and state Sen. Eric Adams, an ex-cop, told a news conference they expect Gov. Paterson will support their proposal.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siegel said Friday's verdict acquitting three detectives in the slaying of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a hail of 50 bullets &quot;proves it is almost impossible to successfully prosecute cases of police misconduct, especially in homicide cases.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict underscores the need for systemic change in the way New York handles these important and, at times, high-profile cases,&quot; he added.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Gov. Nelson Rockefeller created a state special prosecutor's office in 1974, but it was abolished in 1993 by then-Gov. Mario Cuomo.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams (D-Brooklyn) said the office should be permanently reinstated.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are just as responsible for what happened [in the Bell killing] because, although the officers discharged their guns, we loaded the bullets. Our failures loaded the gun,&quot; he said, holding a .38-caliber bullet.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two spoke as Bell's mother, Valerie, visited the Community Church of Christ in Jamaica - where her son was to have been married - and church officials gave out NYCLU pamphlets listing 14 things to do if you're stopped by cops.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siegel and Adams said they expected Paterson to support them because he had been a strong voice in previous police shootings. </SPAN></P>
