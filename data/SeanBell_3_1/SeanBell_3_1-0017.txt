DOZENS OF COPS were pulled off the streets in Brooklyn last night after NYPD officials were tipped off to a plot to shoot patrolmen, police sources said. 
Officers were taken off their foot patrols in East New York, and cop cars were positioned to block a route to the 75th Precinct stationhouse on Sutter Ave. for fear of a drive-by shooting.
The extraordinary measures were taken after a confidential informant - who works with the Brooklyn narcotics squad - told police around 6 p.m. there was a plan to shoot up the Brooklyn stationhouse, sources said.
The plot also called for cops to be targeted in drive-by shootings in Brownsville and Bushwick. It was unclear if the threats were connected to the verdict in the 

 case.
On Friday, the three cops on trial for killing Bell in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day were acquitted of all charges.
Bell's family and supporters, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, have denounced any violence in the name of the Bell verdict; they have vowed peaceful, nonviolent protests.
NYPD brass would not comment on the threat, but a source said it was likely that it did stem from the Bell verdict.
"There are a lot of violent criminals out there who are not happy that a judge sided with the police and found the cops in the 

 case not guilty," said a police source in one of the precincts on alert. "It's not a surprise that threats crop up against police after a decision like this."
