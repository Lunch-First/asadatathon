None of the three was armed. It happened around the corner from the seedy Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica, Queens, where Bell had his bachelor party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov. 29, 2006 - Speaking for the first time since the shooting, Guzman insisted cops &quot;tried to kill me.&quot; Meanwhile, cop sources claimed there was a fourth man by Bell's car who may have run off with a weapon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feb. 29, 2008 - Lt. Gary Napoli, the commanding officer of the accused detectives, said he didn't hear the undercover cops yell &quot;Police!&quot; or see any badges displayed before the shooting because he was reaching under the dashboard of his car to fetch a portable police light.</SPAN></P>
