<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman delivered a fair verdict in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting case, setting aside both emotion and victims' conflicting accounts, top criminal lawyers said yesterday.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Based on the facts, this case was going to be extremely difficult to develop from a prosecutor's perspective, with proof beyond a reasonable doubt, given the chaos that preceded the moments when the shots were fired,&quot; defense lawyer Benjamin Brafman said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case was just headed for disaster when the facts began to crystallize.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many said the key witnesses' criminal pasts and inconsistent stories only added to the difficulty in proving that the officers fired without justification.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Based upon what I understand of the testimony, it was easy for a judge to say there was reasonable doubt,&quot; said Ronald Aiello, a former Brooklyn judge now in private practice. &quot;A jury would never have decided this case. You would have had a hung jury.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenneth Montgomery, a former Brooklyn prosecutor who is now a defense lawyer, said, &quot;The judge seemed to have been the perfect juror.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That judge did what was right, based on the evidence.&quot; </SPAN></P>
