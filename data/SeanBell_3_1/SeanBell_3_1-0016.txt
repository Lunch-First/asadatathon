AFTER BEING indicted for manslaughter, Detective Michael Oliver infamously dined at celebrity restaurant Nello's.
After his acquittal, the 31-shot cop quietly prayed in an orthodox Christian church. 
Oliver traveled Friday from a Queens courtroom to a Holy Week religious service in Little Falls, N.J., where he was welcomed by fellow parishioners.
"We were all praying for Mike," a parishioner said yesterday at the St. George Antiochian Orthodox Christian Church.
Oliver, 36, is a regular at the parish just off Route 46 in suburban Passaic County.
On Friday evening, the 13-year police veteran participated in the parish's Holy Week service; the Orthodox church marks Easter one week after Passover.
Oliver and two fellow detectives were acquitted hours earlier of charges in the shooting death of 
One day after his March 2007 indictment, Oliver infuriated Bell's parents - and some of his own supporters - by enjoying a $4,200 dinner at Nello's. The tab included $180 pasta with truffles and $575 bottles of wine.
At the New Jersey church yesterday, Father Elias Bitar said the trial was hard on Oliver.
Prior to the night of the Bell shooting, Oliver - who is credited with making more than 600 arrests on the job - had never fired his weapon.
"It's difficult for everyone involved when there's a loss of life," Bitar said yesterday. "There's a sadness. You pray for everyone involved.
"You pray everyone gets a fair shake." lmcshane@nydailynews.com
