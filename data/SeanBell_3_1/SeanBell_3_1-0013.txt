Bell case prompts calls for reform
NEW YORK - A coalition of civil rights advocates Sunday urged changes in the handling of police misconduct and brutality complaints after the acquittal of three officers involved in the death of an unarmed man shot on his wedding day. 
They also called for a permanent state-level special prosecutor to investigate such cases.
"The verdict in the 
 case proves it is almost impossible to successfully prosecute cases of police misconduct, especially in homicide cases," said lawyer Norman Siegel, former head of the New York Civil Liberties Union.
Three city police officers were cleared Friday in the November 2006 shooting death of Bell outside a nightclub where he had just left his bachelor party. Two friends were wounded in the volley of 50 shots.
