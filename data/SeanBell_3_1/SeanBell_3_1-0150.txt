Three New York City police detectives have been acquitted in the killing of an unarmed black man who died in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day. The news prompted angry demonstrations and a federal review.  
A New York state judge cleared two officers of manslaughter and a third of reckless endangerment in the death of 

 (23) who was shot, along with two friends, after a bachelor party at a strip club in November 2006. 
Federal authorities said they would consider civil rights charges under a review by the Justice Department, federal prosecutors and the FBI.  
They will "take appropriate action if the evidence indicates a prosecutable violation" of federal civil rights laws, the Justice Department said in a statement.  
After the verdict, hundreds of demonstrators yelled, pushed and shoved as police, reporters and spectators packed the path outside the court building. 
"They're murderers, criminals, and they are going to rot in hell where they belong," one man shouted.

Later, about 1,000 people marched from the courthouse to the site of the shooting, pumping fists, shouting "Justice for 

 NYPD go to hell" and counting from one to 50.  
The killing has outraged New York's black community. 
In a similar case a decade ago, four officers who fired 41 shots were acquitted in the death of an unarmed West African man, Amadou Diallo. 
"It shows that there is no justice in America for the black man," said BM Marcus, a community organiser. 
Gescard Isnora, a black Hispanic undercover officer who fired first, said he followed Bell and his friends to Bell's car believing they were getting a gun to settle a dispute at the club. Isnora said he opened fire after being grazed by Bell's car as the men tried to drive away.  
The other officers arrived after the initial confrontation and said they believed Isnora was being fired at from inside the car.
