<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama made a call for nonviolence in the aftermath of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> verdict - infuriating the Rev. Al Sharpton, who accused the presidential candidate of trying to &quot;grandstand in front of white people,&quot; sources told The Post.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During what a source described as a &quot;heated&quot; phone call yesterday, Sharpton told Obama he was disappointed with the Illinois senator's words on Friday, when Obama said &quot;resorting to violence to express displeasure&quot; was &quot;completely unacceptable and counterproductive.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Obama] issues this statement and not a single rock had been thrown,&quot; said a source. &quot;How does the candidate of change ask people to accept a verdict that is unjust?&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The source said Sharpton had hoped Obama would &quot;side with the Bell family&quot; and not use it as an &quot;opportunity to grandstand in front of white people.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama spokesman described the conversation as a chance to &quot;hear [Sharpton's] views and to get his perspective.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton ratcheted up the pressure on federal prosecutors yesterday by bringing Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to Kalua, the Queens strip club where the Nov. 25, 2006 shooting took place.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to put together a federal strategy on how to deal with the case,&quot; Conyers said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also yesterday, Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman, who rendered the not-guilty verdict, refused to comment on his decision.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said what he had to say on the bench,&quot; his law clerk said.  </SPAN></P>
