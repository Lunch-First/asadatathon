<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Brooklyn designer said he created the stylish </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> black T-shirts worn by many of the tragic groom's supporters on the day of the verdict to make sure no one forgets the heartbreak of that day.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curtis Franklin, 26, said the shirt has been selling online to customers from as far away as Maryland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As young black people, we feel the same pain,&quot; said Franklin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he never met Bell, but they had mutual friends. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those friends asked Franklin to create a shirt honoring the late father of two, who died in a fusillade of bullets just hours before he was to be married. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Franklin was happy to lend a creative hand, especially since the friend who approached him was supposed to have attended the fateful bachelor party in which Bell and two of his pals were shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could have been any one of us in a situation like that anytime,&quot; said Rensford Montrose, who co-owns the design firm Eflat with Franklin. &quot;We're black. It could've happened to us.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shirts, worn by many Bell supporters and shooting victim Trent Benefield at Friday's verdict, are for sale on their Web site, fashionhurtz.com for $25. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the back of the shirts, &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> R.I.P. 1983-2006&quot; is written in script, above &quot;50 SHOTS ISN'T JUSTICE.&quot; </SPAN></P>
