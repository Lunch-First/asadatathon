<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The large number of New Yorkers who tune in to public radio early in the morning for information and relief might have been a little surprised yesterday to hear a 4 1/2- minute segment on Miley Cyrus' controversial Vanity Fair picture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, for that matter, five minutes on the red-hot Grand Theft Auto video game released yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's all part of &quot;The Takeaway,&quot; a new show that shares time on WNYC (93.9 FM, 820 AM) with &quot;Morning Edition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hosted by veterans Adaora Udoji and John Hockenberry, &quot;The Takeaway&quot; is heard from 6-7 a.m. on WNYC-FM and 8-9 a.m. on WNYC-AM. Come the end of June, it will expand to 8-10 a.m. on WNYC-AM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its goal is to be a little breezier, looser and less &quot;packaged&quot; than the classic public radio sound, with the idea of attracting younger listeners. So yesterday's first hour seemed to provide a pretty good sample of what it's aiming for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early on, &quot;Takeaway&quot; did five minutes on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding voter ID requirements. Then it did five minutes of mild incredulity about the annual farm subsidy bill, to which most people, including legislators, pay little attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no headline segments &aacute; la WINS or WCBS-AM, but there was a brief mention of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case and several sports reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hockenberry used his wry tone on pop culture reports, joking that Grand Theft Auto players get into the game when they aren't waterboarding someone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, even the fluffiest of pop culture topics had a public radio flavor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Cyrus report, culture critic Mary Elizabeth Williams - whose two 9-year-olds are mega-fans of Hannah Montana - gently explained how the fury over the picture is a big deal about not much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that Cyrus, her family and Disney people were all in on the shoot, and that its style would hardly surprise anyone who knows the work of photographer Annie Liebovitz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anything,&quot; said Williams, &quot;the picture is a little boring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is exactly what Udoji and Hockenberry do not want said about their program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAREWELL, BIG RON: Big Ron O'Brien, most recently at WOGL in Philadelphia and heard years ago on WNBC and WXLO, died Sunday of pneumonia at the age of 56.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Seinberg, who runs the radio Web site &quot;Big Apple Airchecks,&quot; is producing a tribute to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUMMER JAM LINEUP: The June 1 &quot;Summer Jam&quot; produced by WQHT (97.1 FM) at Giants Stadium will feature Kanye West, Rihanna, T Pain, Ray J &amp; Yung Berg, the Dream, D Block featuring Styles P &amp; Sheek Louch, Lil' Wayne featuring Gym Class Heroes, and Public Enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AROUND THE DIAL: Brian Phillips, most recently heard mornings on WHTG (106.3 FM) at the Jersey Shore, will do 7 p.m.-midnight weeknights at WRXP (101.9 FM). ... The WRKS (98.7 FM) radiothon for St. Jude's last weekend raised more than $149,000. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill DiFazio talks about day labor and homeless youth in his May Day special this morning, 10 a.m., on WBAI (99.5 FM).</SPAN></P>
