Three US detectives have been acquitted of all counts in the 50-shot killing of an unarmed man on his wedding day.
Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper from the New York City Police Department were charged with manslaughter, reckless endangerment and assault in the death of 

Justice Arthur Cooperman delivered the verdict in a Queens courtroom packed with spectators, including the victim's fiancee and parents. The ruling ended a two-month trial.
Mr Bell was killed outside a strip club in Queens on November 25 2006 - his wedding day - as he was leaving his stag party with two friends.
Isnora and Oliver faced the most serious charge of manslaughter.
Shouts of "No!" and "Not guilty!" erupted outside the courthouse.
The officers, complaining pre-trial publicity unfairly painted them as cold-blooded killers, opted to have the judge decide the case.
Officers Oliver, 36, and Isnora, 29, stood trial for manslaughter while Officer Cooper, 40, was charged with reckless endangerment.
Two other shooters weren't charged.
Oliver squeezed off 31 shots; Isnora fired 11; and Cooper shot four.
The case brought back painful memories of other NYPD shootings, such as the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo - an African immigrant who was gunned down in a hail of 41 bullets by police officers who mistook his wallet for a gun. The acquittal of the officers in that case created a storm of protest, with hundreds arrested after taking to the streets in demonstration.
The mood surrounding this case has been muted by comparison.
Although Bell's fiancee, parents and their supporters, including the Reverend Al Sharpton, have held rallies demanding that the officers - two of whom are black - be held accountable.
