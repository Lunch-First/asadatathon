<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOZENS OF COPS were pulled off the streets in Brooklyn last night after NYPD officials were tipped off to a plot to shoot patrolmen, police sources said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers were taken off their foot patrols in East New York, and cop cars were positioned to block a route to the 75th Precinct stationhouse on Sutter Ave. for fear of a drive-by shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extraordinary measures were taken after a confidential informant - who works with the Brooklyn narcotics squad - told police around 6 p.m. there was a plan to shoot up the Brooklyn stationhouse, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plot also called for cops to be targeted in drive-by shootings in Brownsville and Bushwick. It was unclear if the threats were connected to the verdict in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the three cops on trial for killing Bell in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day were acquitted of all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's family and supporters, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, have denounced any violence in the name of the Bell verdict; they have vowed peaceful, nonviolent protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD brass would not comment on the threat, but a source said it was likely that it did stem from the Bell verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a lot of violent criminals out there who are not happy that a judge sided with the police and found the cops in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case not guilty,&quot; said a police source in one of the precincts on alert. &quot;It's not a surprise that threats crop up against police after a decision like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
