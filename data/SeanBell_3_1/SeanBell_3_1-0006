<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE QUEENS judge who cleared the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cops unleashed his fury yesterday on those who violated his privacy after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman - whose decision last Friday brought him international headlines as well as the praise of police supporters and the scorn of the Bell family - lambasted reporters who descended on his neighborhood over the weekend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I resented the fact that people came to my home on the weekend, bothering my neighbors; I'm really very upset about that,&quot; an irate Cooperman said by phone from his chambers in the Kew Gardens courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I haven't accused anyone falsely; I did not spend $4,000 on prostitutes,&quot; Cooperman added, in an apparent reference to the media blitz that surrounded disgraced former Gov. Eliot Spitzer. &quot;That's not journalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 74-year-old judge, who decided the verdict without a jury at the defendants' request, has declined multiple interview requests since the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In explaining his verdict in court Friday, Cooperman criticized the testimony of shooting survivors Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, along with other prosecution witnesses, saying their &quot;credibility was seriously impeached.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge cited the witnesses' criminal convictions, motive to lie and demeanor on the witness stand, apparently referring to Guzman's hostile testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the verdict, a phalanx of cops and court officers guarded Cooperman's Queens home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, who called Cooperman's decision &quot;an abortion of justice,&quot; urged protesters to get arrested &quot;whether it is on Wall St., the judge's house or at 1 Police Plaza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard Brown and lawyers for acquitted Detectives Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper praised Cooperman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, who fired 31 shots, called the verdict &quot;fair and just,&quot; and Brown called Cooperman &quot;one of this county's most experienced and respected judges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In prior interviews, Cooperman said he once considered becoming a journalist, but yesterday he said: &quot;I am so glad I did not go to Columbia Journalism [School] and I picked the law. I had misgivings about that, but not anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
