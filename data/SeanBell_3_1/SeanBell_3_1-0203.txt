ANGRY chants of ''KKK'' and ``murderers'' rang out in New York yesterday as three detectives were acquitted of killing an unarmed black man in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day.
The verdict in the racially-charged 
 case -- which raised questions about whether the New York police were trigger-happy -- placed the city on high alert.
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg appealed for calm saying ``we don't expect violence or law-breaking, nor is there any place for it.''
The city remained calm with protests limited to minor but angry scuffles outside Queens County Court when the verdict
was delivered.
Bell, a 23-year-old father of two, died in a hail of 50 bullets outside the seedy Kalua Cabaret strip club in Jamaica, Queens on November 25, 2006 after leaving his bachelor party with friends. The three undercover detectives, who were at the club investigating reports of prostitution, claimed they believed one of the men was armed.
No gun was ever found.
Justice Arthur Cooperman found the officers not guilty, and suggested the prosecution witnesses had been unreliable. He found the shooting was careless but not reckless.
``At times, the testimony of those witnesses just didn't make sense,'' he said.
``The people have not proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that each defendant was not justified in firing,'' he said.
Cries of ``shame on you'' filled the courthouse.
