A 74-year-old judge known for his no-nonsense approach will deliver one of the most important bench-trial verdicts in the city's history today.   
Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman, slated to render his decision in the 
 trial, once threatened to eject a rape victim from his courtroom for crying too loudly.  
Now he must decide the fate of three detectives accused in the slaying of Bell, who was shot in a hail of 50 bullets on Nov. 25, 2006, in Jamaica.   
Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora face up to 25 years in the slammer for manslaughter. Marc Cooper is charged with reckless endangerment and faces up to a year.  
Cooperman is no stranger to cop trials.  
In 1986, he presided over the trial of NYPD Sgt. Richard Pike and Officer Jeffrey Gilbert, convicted of torturing two teens with stun guns.  
He denied a request to throw out the jury's verdict, calling it an "affront" to "honest and honorable police officers."  
Whatever today's verdict, Bell supporters have promised peace.  
"Let us be the purveyors of peace so the oppressors will not rob of us our most vital resource, our young people," Father Darryl James said last night at Community Church of Christ, where the groom-to-be's funeral had been held.  
Meanwhile, the Kalua strip club, where Bell, 23, had been celebrating his bachelor party, planned to shut down today if the cops go free. "The boss is worried that people will bum rush the place," a bouncer told The Post.  
Court officials said other cases would be postponed until after the verdict.  
Bell's fiance, Nicole Paultre-Bell, had her hair done yesterday.  
"She just wants justice," said her stylist, Ayanna Dossantos, 28, "She's not the same, happy person she used to be."
