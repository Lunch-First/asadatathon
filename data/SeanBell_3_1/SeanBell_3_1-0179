<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THREE detectives in the United States were acquitted yesterday in the near 50-shot killing of an unarmed bridegroom on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman delivered the verdict in a New York courtroom packed with spectators, including victim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fianc&eacute;e and parents, with at least 200 people gathered outside the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high-profile case put the New York Police Department at the centre of another dispute over its alleged use of excessive firepower. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, Bell's fianc&eacute;e walked out of court; his mother cried and gasps were heard throughout the room. Shouts of &quot;No!&quot; and &quot;Not guilty!&quot; erupted outside the courthouse, and dozens of people began crying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, a 23-year-old black man, died in a hail of gunfire outside a strip club in Queens on 25 November, 2006 - his wedding day - as he was leaving his stag party with two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers Michael Oliver, 36, and Gescard Isnora, 29, stood trial for manslaughter while Officer Marc Cooper, 40, was charged only with reckless endangerment. Two other officers were not charged. Oliver fired 31 shots; Isnora fired 11 rounds; and Cooper shot four times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers, complaining pre-trial publicity unfairly painted them as cold-blooded killers, opted for a judge to decide the case rather than a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Cooperman suggested the police officers' version of events was more credible than others involved in the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people have not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant was not justified in firing&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manslaughter charges carried up to 25 years in prison; the penalty for reckless endangerment is a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell's fianc&eacute;e, parents and their supporters have held rallies demanding the officers - two of whom are black - be held accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the officers took the stand. Instead, Justice Cooperman heard transcripts of the three testifying before a grand jury that they believed they had good reason to use deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge also heard from Mr Bell's two companions, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, who insisted the incident erupted without warning. Both were wounded, and Mr Guzman still has four bullets in his body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same day Mr Bell decided to have a last-minute stag party at Kalua Cabaret, the undercover detectives' had chosen to investigate reports of prostitution at the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the club closed at about 4am, Isnora, and Hispolito Sanchez, another undercover detective, claimed they overheard Mr Bell and his friends taunt a stranger, who responded by putting his right hand in his pocket as if he had a gun. Mr Guzman, they testified, said: &quot;Go get my gun,&quot; something Mr Bell's friends denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora said he decided to arm himself, call for backup and follow the trio as they went to Mr Bell's car. He claimed that after he warned the men to halt, Mr Bell pulled away and rammed an unmarked police van with Oliver at the wheel. Isnora said Mr Guzman made a sudden move as if he were reaching for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I yelled, 'Gun!' and fired,&quot; he said. &quot;In my mind, I knew he had a gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Guzman said Isnora &quot;appeared out of nowhere&quot; with a gun and shot him in the shoulder - the first of 16 shots to enter his body. &quot;That's all there was - gunfire,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With tyres screeching, glass breaking and bullets flying, the officers said they believed they were under attack. Oliver responded by emptying his semiautomatic pistol, reloading, and emptying it again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, when Mr Bell's blood-splattered car was examined, no weapon was found inside it.</SPAN></P>
