<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judge in New York yesterday cleared three detectives of all charges relating to the shooting of a young groom in November 2006, who died after he left a Queens strip club with friends, hours before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers fired 50 bullets, killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and injuring two friends as they drove away from the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectives were investigating alleged prostitution at the Kalua club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict triggered cries of protest in and outside the courtroom after a trial that has gripped the city's media for seven weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no justice in America,&quot; cried one man outside the courthouse after the verdict. Among those who walked out in protest were Mr Bell's parents and the civil rights activist the Reverend Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants - detectives Gescard Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper - waived the right to a jury arguing that any panel would be biased against them because of the publicity surrounding the case. Charges against them included first- and second-degree manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Judge Arthur Cooperman said the prosecution had failed to prove that the officers had over-reached their authority in firing the shots. &quot;The testimony of those witnesses just didn't make sense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
