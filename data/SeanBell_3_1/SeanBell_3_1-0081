<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the detectives union accused the Rev. Al Sharpton and his lawyer pal yesterday of &quot;misleading people&quot; on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem I think with this case - it would go back to Sharpton and [attorney Sanford] Rubenstein - is they spent so much time misleading people, and this is a very dangerous thing,&quot; said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They misled the public right from the start, if you recall, and that's why the [district attorney] got so heavily involved,&quot; Palladino said during a meeting with the New York Post editorial board.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that Sharpton misled the Bell family, along with the other shooting victims, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, on the detectives' supposed guilt.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Friday, the three cops who fired the collective 50 shots that killed Bell outside a strip club on his wedding day in November 2006 were acquitted of all charges.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palladino said that the victims' $50 million lawsuit against the officers and the NYPD didn't help the prosecution, noting that during cross-examination, Benefield said he wouldn't say anything to hurt the case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sharpton's greed and Rubenstein's greed mislead the public,&quot; Palladino said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton responded, &quot;I never promised anything but the pursuit of justice.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that he has no financial stake in the civil suit.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I challenge [Palladino to name] any lawsuit that I or [the National Action Network] would benefit from,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a relaxed-looking Detective Michael Oliver, who fired 31 of the 50 shots, reported for modified desk duty early in the morning at the 13th Precinct station house on East 21st Street in Manhattan. Oliver greeted a Post photographer with a wave. </SPAN></P>
