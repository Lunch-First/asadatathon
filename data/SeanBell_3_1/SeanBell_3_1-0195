<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed, Michael Bloomberg told reporters, &quot;It sounds like to me like excessive force was used.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked today at a press conference in Jamaica if he had misgivings about those words now that the police officers have been acquitted, Bloomberg said, &quot;[That was] one of the more ridiculous questions I've heard in a long time.&quot;He also said he thinks &quot;it's easy to second-guess&quot; police action, and described what measures the city is taking to look at police policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, Al Sharpton said he and his supporters are planning to &quot;to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience,&quot; in various parts of the city, like &quot;Wall Street, the judge's house, or 1 Police Plaza.&quot; He added, &quot;We are coming back to demonstrate to the federal government that New Yorkers will not take this abortion of justice laying down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
