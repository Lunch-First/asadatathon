<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THREE detectives in the United States were acquitted of all charges yesterday in the near 50-shot killing of an unarmed groom on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman delivered the verdict in a New York courtroom packed with spectators, including victim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fiancee and parents, with at least 200 people gathered outside the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high-profile case put the New York Police Department at the centre of yet another dispute over the alleged use of excessive firepower. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict provoked an outpouring of emotions. Bell's fiancee immediately walked out; his mother cried and gasps were heard throughout the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shouts of &quot;No!&quot; and &quot;Not guilty!&quot; erupted outside the courthouse, and dozens of people began crying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, a 23-year-old black man, died in a hail of gunfire outside a strip club in Queens on 25 November 2006 - his wedding day - as he was leaving his stag party with two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers Michael Oliver, 36, and Gescard Isnora, 29, stood trial for manslaughter while Officer Marc Cooper, 40, was charged only with reckless endangerment. Two other officers were not charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver fired 31 shots; Isnora fired 11 rounds; and Cooper shot four times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers, complaining that pre-trial publicity had unfairly painted them as cold-blooded killers, opted for a judge to decide the case rather than a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Cooperman suggested the police officers' version of events was more credible than others involved in the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people have not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant was not justified in firing&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manslaughter charges carried up to 25 years in prison; the penalty for reckless endangerment is a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell's fiancee, parents and their supporters have held rallies demanding that the officers - two of whom are black - be held accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the officers took the stand. Instead, Justice Cooperman heard transcripts of the three testifying before a grand jury that they believed they had good reason to use deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge also heard from Mr Bell's two companions, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, who insisted the incident erupted without warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both were wounded, and Mr Guzman still has four bullets lodged in his body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same day Mr Bell decided to have a last-minute stag party at Kalua Cabaret, the undercover detectives' had chosen to investigate reports of prostitution at the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the club closed at about 4am, Isnora, and Hispolito Sanchez, another undercover detective, claimed they overheard Mr Bell and his friends taunt a stranger, who responded by putting his right hand in his pocket as if he had a gun. Mr Guzman, they testified, said: &quot;Yo, go get my gun,&quot; something Mr Bell's friends denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora said he decided to arm himself, call for backup and follow the trio as they went to Mr Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed that after he warned the men to halt, Mr Bell pulled away and rammed an unmarked police van with Oliver at the wheel. Isnora said Mr Guzman made a sudden move as if he were reaching for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I yelled, 'Gun!' and fired,&quot; he said. &quot;In my mind, I knew he had a gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Guzman said Isnora &quot;appeared out of nowhere&quot; with a gun drawn and shot him in the shoulder - the first of 16 shots to enter his body. &quot;That's all there was - gunfire,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With tyres screeching, glass breaking and bullets flying, the officers said they believed they were under attack. Oliver responded by emptying his semiautomatic pistol, reloading, and emptying it again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, when Mr Bell's blood-splattered car was examined, no weapon was found inside it.</SPAN></P>
