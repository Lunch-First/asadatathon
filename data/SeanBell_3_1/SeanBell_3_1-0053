<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laura Harper Paultre said she also prayed there will be peace in Queens &quot;no matter what.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter what the verdict is, it won't bring Sean back,&quot; she said. &quot;I just prayed for justice. But no matter what it is, Sean is dead. Guilty or not guilty, Sean is dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harper Paultre spoke at the Community Church of Christ in Jamaica, Queens, where about a dozen Bell supporters gathered for a 24-hour prayer vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's mother, Valerie, stopped by a few hours later after work. &quot;It's in God's hands right now,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole, and the Rev. Al Sharpton spoke later in the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have no hate. We have no malice. We seek no revenge,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;We put it in God's hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning, Bell supporters will march from the church to Queens Supreme Court, where Justice Arthur Cooperman will read his verdict shortly after 9 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Miraculously, I don't feel any anxiety,&quot; Harper Paultre said. &quot;I'm very optimistic about tomorrow. I have faith in Judge Cooperman and in God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, was killed on his wedding day, Nov. 25, 2006, around the corner from a Queens topless club where he'd just had his bachelor party. Two of Bell's buddies who were in his car, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, were badly wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly afterward, Bell's fianc&eacute;e legally took his last name. She is the mother of Bell's two daughters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like a person who has been sentenced to die in an electric chair, and this is my last day on Earth,&quot; said Bishop Lester Williams, who was supposed to preside at the wedding and was at the vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has been a burden on the community,&quot; Williams said. &quot;Today is the eve of the unknown. . . . Our prayers here are that the citizens will respect the decision of the judge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
