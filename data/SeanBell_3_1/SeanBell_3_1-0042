<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- Three detectives were found not guilty yesterday on all charges in the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who died in a hail of 50 police bullets outside a club in Jamaica, Queens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur J. Cooperman, who delivered the verdict, said many of the prosecution's witnesses, including Bell's friends and the two wounded victims, were simply not believable. &quot;The testimony of those witnesses just didn't make sense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His verdict prompted several supporters of Bell to storm out of the courtroom, and screams could be heard in the hallway moments later. The three detectives -- Gescard F. Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper -- were escorted out of a side doorway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict comes 17 months to the day since the Nov. 25, 2006, shooting of Bell, 23, and his friends, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, outside the Club Kalua in Jamaica, Queens, hours before Bell was to be married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was delivered in a packed courtroom and was heard by, among others, the slain man's parents and his fianc&eacute;e.</SPAN></P>
