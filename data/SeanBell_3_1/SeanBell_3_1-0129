<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov. 25, 2006, should have been the happiest day of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> life. But instead of getting married on that date, he was killed in a hail of 50 bullets fired by a group of New York police officers. The unarmed Bell and his two friends, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, also unarmed, encountered the undercover cops in the parking lot of a Queens strip club. Bell and his friends had gone to the club to celebrate the 23-year-old black man's last hours of bachelorhood. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a few frantic moments, the police officers had fired upon the young men whom they say they feared were armed and dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, three officers, two of whom were black, were acquitted of all charges in the shooting that left Bell dead and Benefield and Guzman wounded. Michael Oliver, a Clifton native who'd fired 31 shots, and fellow officer Gescard Isnora had stood trial for manslaughter. A third officer, Marc Cooper, had been charged with reckless endangerment. Two other shooters were not charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Oliver was the only white officer on trial, the history of black men being shot by the police in New York and across the country gave the case a disquieting racial cast, at least to some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the two-month, non-jury trial, the judge, Justice Arthur Cooperman, explained his verdict. He said the state had not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the police officers - who did not testify in the trial - had previously offered more credible accounts of the early-morning encounter than the two men who survived the torrent of bullets did. The police officers' account of the encounter had been culled from grand jury testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the judge's verdict is just the beginning. A long retrial of the troubling events began Friday outside a Queens courthouse, where some in the crowd shouted, &quot;Murderers!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of public opinion about the verdict will be largely guided by what people are predisposed to believe: what their experiences with the police and young black and brown men have been, and how they feel about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people don't like to talk about the chasms that separate many segments of our society until blood seeps across the divide: Somebody dies. Someone else goes on trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is dead. Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper have been acquitted of the charges against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do you think about that? What are you predisposed to believe?</SPAN></P>
