<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8"> LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ... While the parties clustered around Joanna's car sorting out the situation, Officer Curtis of the Quincy Police Department arrived.  ... One section discussed the numerous hate crimes committed against Asian Americans in Quincy, including tire slashing, window smashing, egging of windshields, physical assaults, and verbal assaults (&quot;gook&quot;; &quot;chink&quot;; &quot;Go back to China&quot;).  ... As such, co-author Lai helped secure defense lawyers who were open to community organizing.  ... In addition to attending all court hearings and public events and reporting the case in its international newspaper, Militant Labor was instrumental in connecting the issues of immigrant rights and police brutality through its newspaper and its monthly forum held in Boston.  ... After a quick consultation, we decided that the co-authors would go to the Mayor's office as intermediaries, bringing along the Chinese press.  ... The attendees of the meeting represented a wide spectrum of supporters, including Quincy residents; the Executive Secretary of the Mayor of Quincy; representatives from the Quincy Human Rights Commission, the Massachusetts Alliance of Portuguese Speakers, and various unions and immigrant groups; others who had worked with Karen on campaigns, and still other concerned citizens, including many Whites.  ... The film depicted a surge of anti-Asian violence in Massachusetts throughout the 1980s, highlighting the Huang case in Boston Chinatown as well as incidents in Chelsea, Revere, and Quincy.  ... According to the 1989 Patriot Ledger report, Asian American victims often sought only an apology from their perpetrators, rather than invoking the law to hold them accountable.  ... The harsh sentences given to the Quincy 4 might be viewed as a statement by the court to future Asian American litigants: do not waste the court's time with a trivial case; take the plea bargain or take a settlement; if you do not cooperate and you are unlucky enough to come before me for sentencing, be forewarned.  ... The letter, to be published as an advertisement, read: For fourteen months, we have supported four Asian Americans (Karen Chen, Howard Ng, Quan Thin and Tat Yuen) in their quest to clear their names after being pepper-sprayed and beaten up by several Quincy police officers and then prosecuted for crimes that they insisted they did not commit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">HIGHLIGHT: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We dedicate this article to the six Asian Americans who placed their libertyand good names on the line to speak out against police brutality and to test the promise of equal justice for all. We make a special dedication to Karen Chen,whose tenacity, generosity and leadership throughout this case awakened othersto recognize that civil rights are an Asian American issue. We believe that theprivate agonies of these individuals and the community's journey alongside themthroughout this ordeal should not be silenced by the ultimate outcomes of the criminal trial. It is in this spirit that we wrote this article.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. Introduction<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The case of the &quot;Quincy 4&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> revolves around an encounter between &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*74]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  four Asian Americans and the police in Quincy, Massachusetts on the eve of &quot;The Great American Strike of 2006&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the resulting criminal prosecutions. The four victims and their supporters assert that the police used excessive force in making the arrests, whereas the police and other Quincy residents paint the incident as a simple case of young adults misbehaving. Unlike other well-known incidents involving excessive force against the African American and Latino communities, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this case involved no serious physical injuries. Still, this case raises several questions, the answers to which prove illuminative. First, given that there are few documented cases of police brutality or excessive force in the Asian American community, how have various sectors in this community reacted to the case? Second, since Asian Americans are typified as the &quot;model minority,&quot; how do the mainstream public and press view this case? Third, in case of similar future incidents, how could the organizing principles and strategies used in this case be put to use? Last, since many cities and towns are, like Quincy, experiencing growth in Asian American populations, what lessons can we draw from this incident?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors write this article not primarily as the Quincy 4's criminal defense attorneys. We write as community lawyers who counseled each of the Quincy 4 as well as the surrounding Asian American community &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*75]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  throughout the case, with a personal interest in protecting individual liberties and building the community's political power. To further these two aims, we helped the victims secure defense lawyers and helped coordinate legal and organizing strategies. Both authors have extensive experience working with and within the Asian American community as legal services lawyers, teachers, and activists. As lawyers, we have both worked on numerous campaigns, struggles, and a myriad of policy reforms that affect the Asian American community in Massachusetts and beyond. Our involvement in this case was both logical and expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section II of this article presents the background of the &quot;Quincy 4&quot; case. Section III addresses the history of Asian American migration into Quincy and of anti-Asian violence in the city during the 1980s. Sections IV and V address the organizing strategies and challenges in mobilizing the community around the case. Here, we discuss how Quincy's history of anti-Asian violence, coupled with a reluctance to &quot;make waves&quot; and with a bipolar Black/White view of civil rights, deterred many Asian Americans from engaging in the campaign. In Section VI, we examine media coverage of the case and consequences for different communities' responses to the verdict and sentencing. In Section VII, we revisit the trial and examine the jury deliberation process and historical parallels between this case and People v. Hall, namely concerning the deployment of Asian American stereotypes during the trial to the victims' detriment. In Section VIII, we discuss how the guilty verdict and the disproportionate sentencing silenced the Asian American community. In Section IX, we discuss lessons learned about organizing Asian Americans for social change. Section X addresses lessons learned as community lawyers. We touch on tensions between community lawyering principles and organizing goals; we discern the success in this seeming defeat. In closing, we argue that we must &quot;put race back on the table&quot; in order to highlight civil rights as an Asian American issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. Background History of the Case<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The events of the Quincy 4 case started around 12:45 a.m. on April 30, 2006 along a major thoroughfare in the City of Quincy near Wollaston, a neighborhood that is home to many Asian American residents and businesses. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Facts of the Case<BR>&nbsp;<BR> On that fateful morning, six individuals - two of whom had celebrated their engagement with family and friends a few hours earlier - were on their way to their respective homes in two separate cars. One car was &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*76]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  driven by the bride-to-be, Ying Mei Cheung, with the groom-to-be Tat Man Yuen in the front seat and two friends, Karen Chen and Howard Ng, in the back seat. In the other car, Joanna Ng was driving with her boyfriend Quan Thin. During the drive, Joanna and Quan began to argue. Joanna parked against the curb on Hancock Street outside the parking lot of a Chinese supermarket, exited the car, and walked toward a 7-Eleven to get a bottle of water. Still upset, she passed the convenience store, called her friends in the other car, and asked them to pick her up and drive Quan home. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During this time, a state trooper had pulled up behind Joanna's parked car and began a verbal exchange with Quan. The trooper alleged that Quan appeared drunk and was &quot;confrontational&quot; even though Quan had complied with his requests. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few minutes after the trooper arrived, the car driven by Mei Ying Cheung picked up Joanna and pulled up behind the parked cruiser. Joanna and Karen Chen exited the car to investigate the situation between Quan and the trooper. As they approached, Joanna had her driver's license in hand to inform the trooper that she was the driver and owner of the car. Howard Ng also exited the car to stand by Quan on the passenger side of Joanna's car as Karen and Joanna talked to the trooper. While the parties clustered around Joanna's car sorting out the situation, Officer Curtis of the Quincy Police Department arrived. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within a minute or so, he deployed pepper spray on the faces of Quan, Howard, and Karen &quot;in a sweeping motion&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> without warning or provocation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Howard and Karen immediately &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*77]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  moved away from the car and into the parking lot. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quan was moved to the front hood of Joanna's car and handcuffed by the trooper. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point, at least two other officers from the Quincy Police Department arrived. One, Officer Folan, blocked Tat from approaching Joanna's car as his friends were dispersed and crouched on the ground. By then, Karen began to wail in pain as she felt the pepper spray's effects in her eyes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An officer told Karen not to rub her eyes and threatened to arrest her if she did not keep quiet. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within seconds, three police officers tackled Karen to the ground, ripped her jacket off, tore her blouse, and handcuffed her. Tat, who tried to come to her aid, was knocked to the ground unconscious. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Howard and Tat were then arrested also. Quan, Howard, Tat, and Karen were taken to the Quincy Police Department for booking. Before returning the keys and car registration to Joanna, Officer Curtis twice questioned her as to where she was from. When she did not &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*78]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  respond as he expected, Officer Curtis told her, &quot;Go back to Somerville, they might do things differently there.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of this encounter, Karen received a black eye and sustained bruises on her head, elbows, and lower back. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her blouse was torn at the neck and on the sides. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tat suffered a concussion. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On top of inflicting these injuries, the Quincy Police charged Karen, Quan, and Tat with two offenses each </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: disorderly conduct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and resisting arrest. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Howard, who remained quiet throughout the incident, was charged only with disorderly conduct. All four were arraigned at the Quincy District Court on May 1, 2006. In the ensuing fourteen months, five pre-trial hearings took place. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. The Trial<BR>&nbsp;<BR> On June 18, 2007, nearly fourteen months after the incident, a jury trial occurred. At the outset, presiding judge Mary Orfanello urged the parties to resolve the case. The prosecutor made a tentative offer to dismiss the case if the parties would agree to a mutual release, which would have protected the Quincy police from potential civil claims in exchange for a pre-trial probation disposition on the criminal case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The offer was rescinded, however, when Quincy's Corporate Counsel rejected the compromise because she believed that it left the city open to future lawsuits by the parties. The only outstanding offer was to dismiss Howard's case if he would provide a written apology to the Quincy Police and waive all &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*79]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense rejected the offer and chose to proceed to trial for all four defendants. Jury selection took one and a half days. Of the thirty-seven potential jurors in the pool, only one was a person of color. The final jury consisted of three men and five women; the lone Black juror was the only person of color. The prosecution's case consisted of the testimonies of six police officers, two of whom were involved only post-arrest. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite Judge Orfanello's jury instructions that the defendants' post-arrest conduct could not be used to prove the resisting arrest allegation, she allowed the two officers to testify to the defendants' alleged unruly behavior during the transportation and booking processes. Obviously, the jury would have taken in all the allegations - jury instructions given at the end of the trial would have been too late to remedy any prejudicial impact created during the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense's witness, Joanna Ng, was one of two people at the scene who faced no criminal charges. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joanna corroborated the trooper's testimony that the parties were at peace when Officer Curtis arrived. She contradicted Officer Curtis' claim that he had to deploy pepper spray because the parties were &quot;out of control.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, she testified that Karen was sitting on the ground screaming because her eyes hurt, that Karen was neither unruly nor threatening, and that Karen was not screaming at the police or interfering with the police action. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joanna also told the court that for a split second, she lost sight of Karen but saw three officers piling on top of the spot where Karen had been only seconds earlier. She pointed out that the picture showing her crouching on the ground depicted the moment when she lost sight of Karen behind the pile of officers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She indicated that, immediately following, she saw Karen being pulled up by the handcuffs behind her back. Joanna also noticed that Karen's jacket was &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*80]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  wrapped around her ankle and tripping her. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the officers admitted that the photograph depicted their actions that night. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officer Folan, who was standing a few feet away from the commotion, claimed that he was so focused on Tat, whom he knocked unconscious to the ground, that he did not notice the officers jumping on Karen. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State trooper McGrail, on the other hand, claimed that he was so focused on Quan - already handcuffed, pepper-sprayed, and pressed face-down on the hood of the car - that he did not see or hear anything happening a few feet away. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial ended around noon on Friday, June 22, 2007. The jury was charged to deliberate around 2:40 p.m. that afternoon, after almost an hour of jury instructions. At around 4:50 p.m. the jury returned to the court room with an acquittal for Howard and guilty verdicts for the other three defendants. Quan was found guilty on both charges, Tat was found guilty of disorderly conduct, and Karen was found guilty of resisting arrest. The prosecutor asked for probation periods of up to two years for the three convicted defendants but did not seek jail time. After a round of appeals by the defense, the judge issued sentences much harsher than what the prosecution recommended. The judge sentenced Quan to a six-month suspended sentence at the house of correction, of which he was immediately to serve ten days; two years of probation; attendance in an Alcoholic Anonymous program three times a week through his probationary period; and random urine testing. The judge also instructed the court officer to handcuff Quan and remove him from the court in front of a roomful of stunned supporters. After learning that Karen was a tenant services coordinator at a public housing development in Boston Chinatown, the judge sentenced her to eighteen months of probation. For a conviction of disorderly conduct, Judge Orfanello sentenced Tat to six months in the house of correction, of which he was immediately to serve ten days, and two years of probation. The court officer handcuffed Tat as well and removed him from the court immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. Asian American Demographics in Quincy<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The case of the Quincy 4 must be examined in the context of a growing Asian American population in Quincy, Massachusetts, a city roughly seven miles southeast of Boston. Based on the 2000 U.S. Census, Quincy has a population of about 88,000, of which Asian Americans comprise 15.7% and Whites comprise 81%. The Asian American population in Quincy grew from 5,554 in 1990 to 13,546 in 2000: an &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*81]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  increase of 143.9%. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historically, Quincy was built on its granite quarrying and ship building industries. The economic downturn of both industries led to a focus on expanding the retail and commercial sectors with an emphasis on the building of residential neighborhoods. Quincy - with its proximity to Boston, cheaper real estate, and easy access to public transit and major highways - became a magnet for Asian immigrants in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The influx of Asians via immigration and refugee resettlement in the late 1970s and early 1980s reflected a nationwide trend. Like many other racially homogenous cities experiencing a surge of new immigrants, Quincy had its share of growing pains. By the late 1980s when Asians were attempting to establish roots in their new homes, hate crimes became a major issue. Several cases of anti-Asian violence surfaced across Massachusetts. A surge of hate crimes against Southeast Asians occurred in Boston, Dorchester, Revere, Chelsea, and Lynn, as well as Quincy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Quincy boasts a growing Asian population, with Asian Americans comprising 15% to 20% of the population. Twenty years have passed since the tumultuous 1980s, but it remains to be seen whether Quincy has learned to address its Asian American residents' civil rights concerns and to provide accessible service to this community'. An examination of the case of the Quincy 4 can shed light on these issues as pertinent not only to Quincy, but also to other cities facing a growing Asian American population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Review of Anti-Asian Violence in the 1980s in Quincy<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Before discussing the Quincy 4 case, it is instructive to present some historical background. A 1989 Patriot Ledger </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> report focused on the arrival of Asian Americans into Quincy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and highlighted many related social issues. One section discussed the numerous hate crimes committed against Asian Americans in Quincy, including tire slashing, window &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*82]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  smashing, egging of windshields, physical assaults, and verbal assaults (&quot;gook&quot;; &quot;chink&quot;; &quot;Go back to China&quot;). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a newspaper poll of 400 white and Asian American residents of Quincy, supplemented with over 200 interviews, almost one-third of Asian Americans polled experienced racial discrimination. On two particular streets, &quot;seven of eleven Asian American families reported smashed car windows, spray-painted racial slurs, or house windows hit by snowballs or rocks. One window was shattered by BBs from an air gun. The homes or cars of five families have been vandalized more than once.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the astoundingly high rate of victimization, few incidents were reported. 82% of Asian Americans polled by the Patriot Ledger said that, regardless of whether the crime was racially motivated, they did not notify the police. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This meant that for every reported anti-Asian incident, six went unreported. This report further stated: &quot;Since September [1988], [Sergeant Thomas] Casey has investigated 16 cases of vandalism, assault and harassment against Asian Americans. He determined that 14 were civil rights violations. He has made no arrests. A clerk-magistrate declined to issue civil rights charges in Quincy District Court against one suspect.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when victimization is reported, deeper institutional problems exacerbate the problems outlined by the Patriot Ledger report; these problems will be elaborated below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Police Officer Cannot Find Racial Motivation in a Crime<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In April 1998, a North Quincy Asian woman was driving home around midnight when a group of teenagers banged their fists against her car. When she stopped to ask them why, four female teenagers proceeded to beat and kick her until neighbors finally came to her aid and she was taken to the hospital. The woman later reported to police that her attackers directed &quot;discriminatory words&quot; towards her during the beating. However, a police investigation by a civil rights officer revealed no racial motivation behind the attack. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is peculiar, since most hate crime experts understand that racial epithets (i.e., &quot;discriminatory words&quot;) are key indicators of hate crimes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most troubling is that a police officer trained in recognizing &quot;civil rights&quot; violations failed to identify the racially oriented &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*83]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nature and motive of the crime. This failure kept the police from understanding the true nature and scope of the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, the State Attorney General's Office stepped in, secured temporary restraining orders against the perpetrators, and prosecuted the four teenagers on hate crime charges. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the restraining orders were issued, the police officer in charge of the Quincy Police Department's Civil Rights Unit - the officer who had denied hate crime motives in the case - was quoted as saying, &quot;this sends a message to those thinking of this type of activity that it will not be tolerated. This policy will be enforced by this department, and you can rest assured this injunction will be reinforced by this department.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One can only speculate as to why the officer changed his opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Clerk Magistrate Will Not Issue Civil Rights Charges<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In a 1998 case involving a white youth's harassment of a group of Asian Americans on Halloween, the district attorney and the police sought to prosecute a 17-year old Quincy High School senior for hate crime violations. The defendant, along with four friends, allegedly threw eggs and yelled racial slurs at two Chinese American youths while driving through a neighborhood. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In January of 1989, the Clerk Magistrate in Quincy District Court determined that there was insufficient evidence to issue a hate crime warrant against the white youth, despite the defendant's admission that he threw eggs at the Chinese American's car and kicked in a car window. Charges were dropped in exchange for the defendant's agreement to write a letter of apology to the two victims. This outcome frustrated the efforts of the District Attorney's office and the police to address an ongoing problem. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One can only wonder in how many other instances had local court personnel thwarted hate crime prosecutions by wielding discretionary powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Prevailing Attitudes of Police Officers<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The Patriot Ledger report also included interviews of six Quincy police officers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though not representative of the police department as a whole, this report provides a window into police attitudes. The Quincy &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*84]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police Department had been known for its innovative approach to civil rights issues. In addressing the rise of anti-Asian violence, the police chief appointed a civil rights officer, persuaded the Norfolk County District Attorney's Office to draft a policy that prioritized civil rights cases, and brought in experts to conduct sensitivity training of all officers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One officer's view of these initiatives was that the city had turned Asians Americans' civil rights into a cause celebre: &quot;First it was battered woman [sic], then it was drunk driving, now it's civil rights. A guy yells &quot;gook' and they put him behind bars. Let's be careful we don't screw up someone's life just because they yelled &quot;gook'.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regarding language barriers, some officers believed that Asian Americans feign ignorance of English in order to avoid charges: &quot;They play that no-speaky-English game ... you don't know it for sure, but you feel it. You know when they're driving the Volvo and the lady's dressed in clothes from Lord and Taylor that gives you some cause to wonder.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether or not these sentiments signify an institutional problem in Quincy, they cast negative light on the Police Department. The apparent situation is one of white officials overlooking cases of Asian American victimization and exercising leniency in cases where Whites were the perpetrators. All things being equal, city officials should have been concerned with such tendencies and investigated whether there was a pattern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Justice System's Inability to Prosecute Civil Rights Violation<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In addition to institutional intransigence, further barriers have prevented hate crime prosecutions, as a Northeastern University study illuminates. The study used data from the Boston Police's Community Disorders Unit (&quot;CDU&quot;), whose purpose is to investigate crimes involving racial overtones. Of 452 cases recorded from 1983 to 1987, thirty-eight were tried, eighty-three were deemed unsupported by sufficient evidence, one hundred and twenty-seven were dropped when victims declined to move forward, one hundred and thirty involved no arrested suspects, and twenty-two involved victims declining to press charges. Of the thirty-eight cases tried, six involved civil rights charges, with assault and battery or vandalism allegations comprising the other charges. Of the four hundred and fifty-two cases, only five perpetrators were sent to jail, and only one was convicted of a civil rights violation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asian American victims face multiple hurdles to attaining justice: reluctance to report crimes; lack of cultural and linguistic resources in the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*85]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  police department; inability of police to find the perpetrator or identify the nature of the crime; negative attitudes of some police officers toward Asian Americans; and court personnel's discretion and possible biases in handling these cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IV. The Organizing Strategies<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The Quincy 4's organizing strategy was heavily influenced by our collective experience with anti-Asian violence cases and with community organizing generally. Five essential devices emerged from the onset: community meetings, rallying, petitioning, filling of the courtroom, and media outreach. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Support Committee was formed within two weeks of the incident to centralize the organizing of strategies and to carry out discrete campaigns. As this was a criminal proceeding, we knew that overall efforts must be coordinated with the defense team's legal strategy, with the Support Committee serving a clearinghouse function. As such, co-author Lai helped secure defense lawyers who were open to community organizing. Organizing tactics were assessed through the lens of the liberty interests that the defense sought to protect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Influences of Earlier Anti-Asian Violence Cases<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Most participants in the organizing effort knew of the tragic Vincent Chin case, in which an Asian man was beaten to death in Detroit in 1982, during a time of animosity toward Japanese automobile production. The two white defendants, Ronald Ebens and Michael Nitz, never served a day in jail. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, not a single family member of the victim was notified of the court date of the criminal sentencing; the family had to learn through a friend about the lenient sentence of two years' probation and a $ 1,500 fine for each defendant. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boston area activists were also familiar with a local 1985 police brutality case in which a man, Long Guang Huang, had been beaten by a Boston detective who mistakenly accused him of propositioning a white prostitute. Huang was charged with assault, battery, and resisting arrest. After three months of community-based outcries, the 56-year-old Huang was acquitted of all criminal charges and won an $ 85,000 settlement in his civil rights suit against the Boston Police Department. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Significantly, the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*86]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Huang case occurred at the height of publicity surrounding the federal civil rights prosecution of Chin's murderers. The Huang case was thus an opportunity for the Boston community to organize against anti-Asian violence by galvanizing the Asian American community and uniting local political forces. Although the Chinese Progressive Association </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> led the organizing effort, other Boston community organizations supported the campaign wholeheartedly on the premise that an attack on one Asian is an attack on all Asians. These groups included mainstream service organizations such as Boston Chinatown's Josiah Quincy School Community Council and conservative organizations such as the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lesson from the Chin case, which saw neither family nor community involvement in the initial criminal trial, is that community members cannot sit by and expect the court to deliver justice. The Huang case proved that if we would mobilize and stay vigilant, the court would take notice. The positive outcomes of the Huang case were echoed and reinforced a few years later by another anti-Asian incident in Lowell, Massachusetts, in the case of Prem Suksawat. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, the lessons of recent history called for us to organize, mobilize, and be vigilant in the Quincy 4 case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Putting the Organizing Strategies to Work<BR>&nbsp;<BR> A few hours after release from the police station, Karen contacted her &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*87]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  employer and also her former supervisor, co-author Lai. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The immediate task was for the victims to undergo medical evaluation and treatment. On the evening of April 30, 2006, the six of them met with co-author Lai to discuss the incident - and only then did the parties realize that they been beaten by the police for no reason, that they had been charged with crimes, and that their arraignment was scheduled for the following morning in Quincy District Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the Huang case, this incident took place at a volatile time - in the context of a nationwide conversation about legalizing an estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants. In fact, the incident occurred the morning before &quot;The Great American Strike 2006,&quot; when advocates called for all immigrants to boycott work and commerce in order to demonstrate the economic impact of immigrant communities in the United States. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given this backdrop, the police officer's words to Joanna - &quot;Go back to Somerville&quot; - indicate that anti-immigrant sentiments played a role in the police's treatment of the Quincy 4 that evening. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the arraignment on May 1, 2006, the defendants had hoped that the prosecutor would drop the charges, as they believed they had done no wrong. If the police intended to teach them a lesson for talking back, it seemed that the pepper spray, physical battery, and four-hour detention had been more than sufficient. Besides, none of the defendants had criminal records, and the charges here were minor. No pre-trial disposition, however, was forthcoming. The case was scheduled for a pre-trial hearing on June 27, 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It became clear after the arraignment that this case was not simply about the liberties of four individuals. It was a case to challenge anti-Asian violence, to combat anti-immigrant sentiments, and to test the ideals of equality under the law. The question for us became how we could arouse the sleeping giant that was the growing Asian American population in Quincy. We faced two immediate tasks: securing counsel for all the defendants, n61a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>nd</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> establishing a Support Committee to coordinate the campaign. A third, loftier goal was to organize the community to secure justice. The first task proved far easier to accomplish than the other two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*88]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Community Meeting<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Within a week of the incident, the core group that included co-author Lai and key Chinese Progressive Association personnel had met with the group of six to understand the facts of the case and to explore the legal terrain of both the criminal prosecution and possible civil claims against the police. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group also discussed filing civilian complaints against the police and developing a media strategy. Although Karen suffered personal and physical injury, she made it clear from the onset that her battle went beyond personal vindication. At the May Day Rally at the Boston Commons, she stated, &quot;If this can happen to me, imagine how much more likely that this can happen to other immigrants who do not speak English!&quot; In that spirit, the organizing and community mobilization began. But unlike Karen, who had been active in the community for a decade, the other five victims did not choose to be activists. They wanted only justice. As Quan put it, &quot;How can they take away my freedom just like that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The location of the first community meeting on the Quincy 4 case was critical. There were discussions about holding the meeting in Boston Chinatown where we enjoyed a base of supporters from years of community organizing. This was dismissed in favor of a location in Quincy, even though organizers knew they were entering uncharted territory without a robust support base. The Support Committee made this decision for several reasons. First, the incident took place in Quincy, and if we sought to activate the Quincy Asian American community, we needed to be on their &quot;turf.&quot; Second, if we wanted to explore how many people of color had experienced similar incidents in Quincy, and if we wanted to build a coalition across racial and ethnic lines, we needed to step beyond our Chinatown comfort zone and work with other potential constituents and organizations. Finally, as Asians were a racial minority in Quincy, the Asian American community had to begin to assert itself by collectively organizing and maintaining a physical presence in Quincy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial contacts with Asian American social service organizations in Quincy proved lukewarm. These organizations were reluctant to lend either space or support to the Support Committee. Potential reasons for this situation will be explored later. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the end, the Support Committee found an initial organizing space in a Chinese church in Quincy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Filling the Courtroom<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Between the arraignment on May 1, 2006 and the trial that &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*89]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  commenced on June 18, 2007, five pre-trials took place. The Quincy 4 Support Committee made it a priority to organize large crowds of people to attend these hearings. The purpose of these court attendances was twofold. First, the Committee wanted to ensure that the defendants felt supported. Second, the Committee wanted to demonstrate to the court and city officials that the community was concerned about this case and was watching it closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first pre-trial hearing occurred on June 26, 2006, two days after a rally was held in front of Quincy City Hall, calling for the District Attorney's office to drop the charges. Approximately seventy people attended this hearing, including members of the Quincy Human Rights Commission. As this was a pre-trial hearing, the case was scheduled simultaneously with at least twenty other cases. The courtroom was too small to accommodate all the community observers, and most stood, filling the back and sides of the room. The court personnel, surprised by the overwhelming interest, suggested that a larger courtroom be used for the next hearing. When the second pre-trial hearing took place on July 26, 2006, an estimated 120 people attended. Many could not secure standing room and had to wait outside. Because it was time-consuming to usher in and locate space for the participants - many of them elderly - court personnel began to show resentment toward the community members. The judge admonished the crowd for making noise, and others in the courtroom made snide remarks about our presence. When yet another pre-trial hearing was set, some attendees, including members of the Chinese press, began to doubt the effectiveness of the organized court attendances. To allay these doubts, the co-authors debriefed the community members on what had occurred at the end of every hearing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in order to educate the community not only about the case, but also more generally about the American criminal justice system. By comparing the disposition of other cases before the court and the Quincy 4 case, these debriefings also allowed community members to judge for themselves the injustice of the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the case continued well into the winter, thirty to fifty members of the community consistently attended the next three pre-trial hearings. The attendees included members of the Chinese American community, as well as students, professors, labor organizers, clergy, workers, politicians, candidates for political office, teachers, supporters of the Somerville 5 case, and activists of all stripes spanning racial and ethnic lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Rallies and Petitions<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Over the course of the Quincy 4 case, the Support Committee organized two rallies in Quincy. Public rallies were a central component of the Support Committee's strategy; they signified unity of purpose not just &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*90]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  regarding the Quincy 4 case, but also in the cause against police brutality. For instance, we invited members of the Somerville 5 to speak at one rally. These rallies also facilitated outreach to other communities or groups whose members learned of the case and attended to show their support. One group, Militant Labor, attended our first rally in June of 2006 and remained as a consistent presence throughout the case. In addition to attending all court hearings and public events and reporting the case in its international newspaper, Militant Labor was instrumental in connecting the issues of immigrant rights and police brutality through its newspaper and its monthly forum held in Boston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to promoting outreach, rallies also served as venues to educate people about the facts of the case. Because of the pendency of the criminal prosecution, the defendants were under their counsel's advice not to speak publicly about the case. As a result, tension developed between the public's desire to hear from the defendants and the defendants' need for protection in the legal proceedings. The compromise solution of having members of the Support Committee speak on their behalf was less than ideal since the news media preferred first-hand information. Some community members also wondered whether the defendants had something to hide. As the case proceeded to trial, the decision to protect the defendants from public exposure proved to be prudent. The prosecution subpoenaed the Chinese Progressive Association's Executive Director as a witness, seeking to introduce into evidence flyers that the Support Committee had distributed and e-mail messages obtained in order to attribute statements to the defendants for impeachment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second rally took place in front of the Quincy City Hall around noon on a weekday following the second pre-trial hearing. 120 attendees at this hearing marched from the courthouse to City Hall. The protest was highly visible to passersby, since the site had heavy automobile traffic and was near a subway stop. This was probably the first instance in which an Asian American group made a public impact in Quincy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to holding rallies and protests, the Support Committee also circulated petitions with seven demands, including the dismissal of all criminal charges against the Quincy 4. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The petitions allowed those who could not attend court hearings to show their support. The Quincy 4 Support Committee gathered over 1,000 signatures urging the Mayor of Quincy, the Quincy Police Chief, and the Norfolk District Attorney to exonerate the victims and to investigate the police misconduct. Although these actions helped boost the spirits of the four defendants, they ultimately &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*91]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  did not change the outcome of the criminal case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Reaching Out to Politicians and Public Officials<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Experience has taught us that a successful campaign must carry both &quot;sticks and carrots.&quot; While petitions, protests, rallies, and court-packing could be interpreted as &quot;sticks,&quot; meetings with city officials would be &quot;carrots,&quot; representing our desire to reconcile and find an acceptable disposition. We wanted to first connect with members of the Quincy Human Rights Commission, some of whom attended the first community meeting at the church. These members invited Support Committee members to attend a Commission meeting. Although the Commission did not have jurisdiction to deal with the case, it was reassuring to know that there were people in Quincy who cared about Asian American residents and about the defendants' mistreatment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the pre-trial hearing on July 26, 2006, the Support Committee had notified the Mayor's office about the post-hearing rally and asked to meet with the Mayor. By that point, the Support Committee had collected over 1,000 petitions and letters asking the City to drop the charges and to investigate police misconduct. The Support Committee decided to pressure the Mayor regarding the demands and to find out more about a report stating that the City had referred Karen and Joanna's civilian complaints to an outside law enforcement agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the march, seventy-five protesters entered Quincy City Hall and asked to meet with the Mayor. On seeing the crowd, the Mayor's receptionist indicated that only one person from the group might see the Mayor. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within seconds, five to six Quincy police officers appeared in the lobby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This encounter with the receptionist was problematic on many fronts. First, her abrasive attitude may reflect the way city gate-keepers interact with the public. It is little wonder that Asian Americans rarely set foot in &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*92]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  City Hall. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, her demand that only one person meet with the Mayor forced us to choose a single representative, which contradicted the Support Committee's non-hierarchical organizing principle. We wanted all supporters to participate in any such meeting. After a quick consultation, we decided that the co-authors would go to the Mayor's office as intermediaries, bringing along the Chinese press. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The co-authors informed the Mayor that many other community members were waiting to speak with him but were barred by the receptionist. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mayor instructed his assistant to invite all supporters to his office. To the fifty to sixty supporters, the Mayor explained that he could not discuss the case itself, but that he had referred the civilian complaints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that the Department of Justice would investigate. Some supporters questioned the impartiality of such an investigation and reiterated the Committee's demand for an open and public investigation, while others raised the prospect of a civilian review board to investigate police misconduct. The Mayor dismissed these ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the meetings with the Human Rights Commission and the Mayor produced no breakthroughs, they were positive events. These meetings brought the supporters to the table for once and held elected officials accountable to the entire community, especially those portions not proficient in English. Despite having to climb three flights of stairs, everyone, including many elderly supporters, drew energy from this small but significant victory. The experience of sitting across the table from the Mayor and questioning him was inherently empowering for community members. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Quincy 4 were also empowered by their ability to tell their story to the Quincy Human Rights Commission. On this front, the Support Committee surely remained true to democratic organizing values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">V. Mobilization of Community and Its Challenges<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Although the Chinese Progressive Association has hundreds of members who live in Quincy, it does not have an office or an established base in the city. Recognizing that outsiders, no matter how well intentioned, cannot just parachute into the community and dictate action, the small, ad hoc committee comprising of co-author Lai and Lydia Lowe of the Chinese Progressive Association solicited community leaders for support. By doing so, the committee hoped to educate them about the Quincy 4 case before rumors obscured the truth in the community, and to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*93]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  solicit their sponsorship of a community meeting in Quincy. The initial response was interesting. One community leader suggested postponing the community meeting until after a meeting with community leaders could take place. His ostensible concern was that in order to achieve a high turnout for the community meeting, community leaders must first be convinced to support the event. The ad hoc committee interpreted this as a retreat to back door dealings between &quot;leaders&quot; and politicians, which was not our model of community empowerment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another community leader who supported the meeting believed that this incident could not be swept under the rug. He felt that while it was important to respect community leaders, the community voice was important. With their lukewarm blessing, the committee set out to organize the community meeting in Quincy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Internal Quincy Challenges<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The community meeting of May 21, 2006 gave the Quincy 4 Support Committee its first taste of organizing in Quincy. The Chinese Progressive Association staff phone banked its Quincy members to ask them to attend the meeting. Some members questioned the defendants' integrity, whereas others felt sympathy for the victims and indignation at the violence perpetrated on fellow Asian Americans. Most telling was the debate over Chinese wording in the flyer among CPA staff before the meeting. Some felt that the term &quot;police brutality&quot; (that is, its Chinese equivalent) was too inflammatory because not all police officers were bad. Other community leaders in Quincy found the initial flyer, which summarized the facts </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and presented the seven demands, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> too polarizing. Still another community leader felt that the predominant representation of Chinese Americans on the Support Committee was problematic and would be seen as pitting the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*94]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese against the Quincy police. Most doubted that the Asian American community or the Quincy community at large would be ready to support the defendants at the community meeting. Given the time sensitive-nature of criminal proceedings, the Committee chose to proceed with the meeting and to map out future plans based on the community's reaction at the meeting. To alleviate concerns about Chinese wording on the flyer, the Committee used a relevant Chinese newspaper article with a caption for the notice of the community meeting. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the outreach process, volunteers distributed hundreds of flyers at the North Quincy and Wollaston subway stations. Many people began telling volunteers about their own experiences with the Quincy police. These stories recounted conduct ranging from discourtesy and threats to abuse of authority and use of excessive force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the community meeting on May 21, 2006, organizers prepared the room for about 100 people. People began to arrive half an hour beforehand. It took only a few minutes for the seats to fill up. When the meeting began, there was a standing-room-only crowd of 140 people. Before the meeting, co-author Lai spoke to a few attendees. Two middle-aged Chinese men took the few minutes before their restaurant shifts to attend because they felt they had waited long enough for someone to expose Quincy police misconduct. They relayed how some Quincy police officers, in uniforms or in plain clothes, often showed up at their restaurants around closing hour, then ate and drank without paying. One man recalled the community's response to the Huang case and felt strongly that the community had to be organized to tackle the current case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attendees of the meeting represented a wide spectrum of supporters, including Quincy residents; the Executive Secretary of the Mayor of Quincy; representatives from the Quincy Human Rights Commission, the Massachusetts Alliance of Portuguese Speakers, and various unions and immigrant groups; others who had worked with Karen on campaigns, and still other concerned citizens, including many Whites. The community meeting's goals were three-fold: (1) to inform the community about the Quincy 4 incident, (2) to hear from the community about similar incidents involving the Quincy Police, and (3) to rally the community around the goals set forth by the Support Committee. By a show of hands, a majority of those in attendance supported the seven demands. The sheer number of attendees at the meeting, and the enthusiasm expressed by some attendees to join task-oriented sub-committees, belied the community leaders' prior perception of Quincy as apathetic and unready to push for changes. The Support Committee hoped to build on this momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*95]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Lack of Participation from Asian Americans in the Struggle<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The timing of this case could not have been worse. The main (if not only) organizing capacity in the Asian American community rested with the Chinese Progressive Association, which was on its last leg of a campaign to buy office space on the hard-fought Parcel C. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n78At</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this time the CPA was planning its office relocation and raising funds for the building; moreover, key personnel were on summer vacation. Hence, organizing capacity was vastly diminished. Even worse, CPA's lead organizer was Karen who, as a defendant in this case, was in many ways hampered in her efforts to lead the organizing. Still, absent other organizing resources, Karen continued to play a role in organizing, both within the defendant group and within the community. Meanwhile, some community leaders, rather than support the struggle for justice, undermined the defendants' cause by challenging their claims based on the police's report. While the case was pending, another racial incident occurred in Quincy involving Asian American middle school students who were tied to a schoolyard fence and stoned by white students. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Community leaders who knew of the incident refused to share information with the Quincy 4 Support Committee, claiming that the incident was merely one of &quot;bad kids&quot; misbehaving rather than racial in nature. The leaders did not believe that the middle school incident was linked to the Quincy 4 case, or that both incidents reflected an underlying problem of anti-Asian hostility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To situate the Quincy 4 case within a long history of anti-Asian violence, the Support Committee screened a made-for-television documentary, produced in the late 1980s, entitled &quot;Violence Against Asians.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The film depicted a surge of anti-Asian violence in Massachusetts throughout the 1980s, highlighting the Huang case in Boston Chinatown as well as incidents in Chelsea, Revere, and Quincy. The screening was intended to inform a generation that was too young to have known of these events at the time, to portray anti-Asian violence as a theme linking the past to the present, and to energize younger activists in training. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About thirty people attended the screening and discussion. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*96]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, the enthusiasm following the May 2006 community meeting and screening proved short-lived. One community meeting attendee, a religious leader in Quincy, decided based on his own research that the police action was justified. In the week after the meeting, he sent out a lengthy e-mail enumerating his analysis, alleging factual errors, and asked to be removed from the listserv. Many others who signed up to join the sub-committees did not follow through. By the end of the summer, the Support Committee had no more support than it had at the outset of the case. Other young Asian American activists who had showed initial enthusiasm now attended events sporadically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&quot;Let's Not Make Waves!&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Both the &quot;blame-the-victim&quot; mentality and the lack of follow-through may be attributed to a cultural reluctance to &quot;make waves.&quot; This attitude, like anti-Asian violence in Quincy, has a long history. According to the 1989 Patriot Ledger report, Asian American victims often sought only an apology from their perpetrators, rather than invoking the law to hold them accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August of 1988, a fight erupted between Vietnamese refugees and white youths at the Welcome Young Playground, resulting in the hospitalization of three white and three Vietnamese youths. By October, four Vietnamese youths and two white youths involved were charged with assault and battery; no civil rights complaints were filed. A month later, the presiding judge at the Quincy District Court found the Vietnamese defendants not guilty. Subsequently, the Vietnamese youths decided to drop all charges against the white defendants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the Vietnamese youths, Kim Dang, who was hit by a rock, stated, &quot;I didn't care about a conviction. All I want is to change their understanding. I want to ask them, &quot;Why don't you like me?' Afterward, the kid said thank you and we shake hands. I felt like something was released - something really heavy. All I want is to walk down the street and be able to play in the playground. That's freedom.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sam Lee, a 16-year-old eleventh grader, was passing through a turnstile at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (&quot;MBTA&quot;) subway station when a toll collector, believing that he had evaded payment, chased him and yelled derogatory remarks. As Lee recalled, the man had yelled: &quot;I should send you back to your rice paddies; you ruined our lives in Vietnam.&quot; The collector detained Sam and locked him in the tollbooth for forty-five minutes. At a departmental hearing, the MBTA determined that the collector had erred and should be fired. Sam's mother agreed with the dismissal and refused to press charges against the MBTA. She &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*97]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reasoned, &quot;If I go to court, they will make a record for the collector ... . I don't want to punish the man.&quot; She only wanted the MBTA to publish an apology in the newspaper, and to print fare signs in Quincy in Chinese. Sam himself preferred a harsher punishment: &quot;That's not enough ... .. I'm not mad at what he called me, I'm mad he touched me. The guy's like 6-feet tall.&quot; Sam's friends were also surprised that he did not take the perpetrator to court: &quot;They say, &quot;How can you let him do that to you?'&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Asian Americans, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> like Sam's mother, have tended to downplay incidents of discrimination and racism and to allow perpetrators to get away with lesser punishments. Some are motivated by fear of retaliation. This fear, combined with the common self-perception of first-generation immigrants or refugees as not &quot;full Americans,&quot; might explain the prevailing tendency among Asian Americans to &quot;just let it go.&quot; The Sam Lee case reflects a contrasting mentality among second-generation Asian Americans who acculturate to a different sensibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our experience in the Quincy 4 case indicates that the first-generation attitudes persist. Because Asian Americans remain a minority in Quincy, fear of retaliation is legitimate. After a post-verdict community meeting in Quincy, co-author Leong, while driving in Quincy in the late afternoon, received racial taunts from white drivers and pedestrians on three occasions. Another Support Committee member, on coming from the MBTA station to the same community meeting, was ignored by several individuals whom she asked for directions, and then was called &quot;chink&quot; as she exited the station. The Quincy 4, and Karen in particular, defied the prevailing &quot;let's not make waves&quot; mentality by refusing to let the incident dissipate through the passage of time. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Lack of Civil Rights Within the Asian American Community<BR>&nbsp;<BR> As soon as the Quincy 4 incident hit the news, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rumors abounded. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*98]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some assumed that the defendants must have been culpable because they were out at midnight. Many also reflected a heavy presumption that the police action was justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the name of the Support Committee was debated. Some suggested &quot;Quincy 6,&quot; since six Asian Americans were involved. In the end, to avoid confusion, we settled on &quot;Quincy 4&quot; to reflect the number of defendants formally charged. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The use of Quincy 4 was intentional, meant to build solidarity with other minority victims of police brutality and racism. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such name association would allow for easy identification as an incident involving the police, and signified multi-racial and multi-ethnic solidarity. However, not everyone agreed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Assumptions of Guilt and Trust in Authority<BR>&nbsp;<BR> At the May 2006 community meeting, a young Asian American man voiced the view that the defendants had to prove their innocence. He &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*99]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  questioned the presence of the six individuals on the roadside during early morning hours and doubted that police would have used pepper spray or tackled them unless they had engaged in illegal behavior. Bespeaking faith in the police, he expressed incredulity at the notion that the officer could have pepper sprayed the victims without provocation and that three officers would then tackle Karen to the ground for no reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Interplay Between the Model Minority Myth and Asian Americans' Inability to Recognize Racism<BR>&nbsp;<BR> During the fourteen months between arrest and verdict, the co-authors and other activists visited college campuses and talked to Asian American students about the case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of these gatherings were small and predominantly comprised women. Unfortunately, these gatherings did not arouse collective outrage. There were certainly expressions of concern about Karen and questions about the criminal proceedings and the potential for civil claims. However, these events failed to arouse the students to connect the Quincy 4 case with broader challenges of anti-immigrant attitudes, anti-Asian violence, and racial tension, or to inspire campus activism. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This lack of response perhaps reflects acquiescence to the model minority myth enshrouding Asian Americans. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Statistics show that Asian Americans, relative to other racial groups, have high household incomes, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a high proportion of degree holders, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> high representation on selective &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*100]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  college campuses, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and high representation in management, professional and related occupations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These statistics, however, mask the diversity among Asian Americans and do not account for household size, education level, immigration history, and English-language proficiency. Nevertheless, Asian Americans have become the socially acceptable minority group, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> having overcome challenges that persist for other groups, even without external assistance. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asian Americans have been cast as a role model for other minority groups to emulate. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given this placement on a pedestal, many Asian Americans cannot fathom the notion of anti-Asian sentiment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The implication, then, is that those who face the wrath of police, such as the Quincy 4, must deserve it due to individual misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Going Beyond Black and White: Asian Americans Have Civil Rights Too<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The Quincy 4 originally faced difficulty in securing legal counsel for their criminal matters. Within a week of the incident, co-author Lai contacted the local Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, various criminal &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*101]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defense lawyers from the National Lawyers' Guild, and a criminal defense firm known for its challenges of police brutality. None followed up or offered referrals. The authors speculate that their inaction reflects failure to recognize the civil rights implications of the case and its significance to the Asian American community. The only civil rights group to offer assistance to the Support Committee was the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The established civil rights community may be slow to recognize that victims of civil rights violations are not always Black. This tendency is not surprising; most of the existing civil rights literature assumes a Black/White paradigm, mentioning Asian Americans in passing, if at all. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asian Americans share this tendency to forget that Asian Americans, too, have civil rights and that those rights are routinely violated. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the studies that discuss Asian Americans civil rights issues, most are authored by Asian Americans and published in Asian American-focused journals. This trend of civil rights issues in separate tracks is troubling; it tends to drive a wedge between different communities of color and fosters a &quot;zero-sum&quot; mentality, diminishing what should be a collective conversation into an argument over whose suffering has been greater. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anger that might be focused by a collective understanding of systemic injustice, and hence channeled into collective action toward racial justice for all, is instead squandered in internal bickering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VI. Examining the Media Coverage<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The Long Guang Huang case and subsequent community organizing have demonstrated that media coverage can influence the outcome of a case'. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than fifty print media news reports featured the Quincy 4 case between May 2006 and July 2007; 70% of these appeared in the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*102]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese press. The case was also reported on various blogs and websites. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A majority of these online postings </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> consisted of information posted by the Support Committee on its listserv </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Quincy 4 websites. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No mainstream broadcast media covered the case, and only one Chinese-language cable access program covered the May 2006 community meeting. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Exploring Coverage Between Chinese Press, the Militant and the Mainstream Press<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Coverage by mainstream English press and Chinese press differed significantly. Sampan, a bilingual community newspaper, first reported the incident. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sampan reporter was one of the few journalists who actually met Karen, interviewed her, and personally witnessed her black eye and bruises. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A second account was reported by the World Journal, a Chinese newspaper with a worldwide circulation. It provided more details about the night of April 30, 2006 but lacked reference to an official police &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*103]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  report. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the major Chinese press attended the May 2006 community meeting, but no English-language media were present. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nor did the mainstream English media cover the June 2006 rally. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only two mainstream English newspapers in the Boston region, the Boston Globe and the Patriot Ledger, covered the case; together they published fourteen reports on the Quincy 4. Beyond the Boston area, one other English-language newsweekly, the Militant, covered the case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the Support Committee's efforts to circulate details of Karen and Tat's physical injuries, none of the Ledger's nine news accounts mentioned harm sustained by the defendants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, in a parallel article on the July 2006 meeting with the Mayor, the Ledger included nearly the entire police report of the incident. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports filed during trial were also silent about Karen and Tat's injuries, even though the defense entered relevant photos into evidence. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further, in covering the trial, the Ledger did not indicate that Officer Curtis's testimony was contradicted by the other five officers who testified. Nor did it report on the racial composition of the jury, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which is &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*104]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  often a crucial factor in cases where race is an issue. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the Ledger, the Boston Globe took a more neutral, even sympathetic approach. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the Globe did publish a long letter by a state trooper who suggested that the defendants and their supporters were un-American, and condemned the supporters for playing the race card. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, while the case was pending, the Globe gave front-page treatment to Quincy's public relations event - a police outreach to elder Chinese residents accompanied by a photograph of a roomful of elderly Chinese proudly displaying their certificates. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without any reference to the Quincy 4 case, the article failed to reveal that it was the tension between the Quincy police and the growing Asian American community that spurred such community outreach in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Militant's coverage provided a stark contrast to the mainstream English-language coverage. One reporter followed the case from June 2006 until the end. Unlike the Ledger, which depicted the Mayor's meeting with Quincy 4 supporters as conciliatory, the Militant reported the contentious meeting that actually took place. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such candid reports, however, had limited circulation because its readership remains small in number. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*105]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Compared to the English press coverage, the Chinese press coverage was more frequent and detailed. Because all three major Chinese-language newspapers were present at community meetings, rallies, and court hearings, the Chinese press coverage invariably contained more details about events, which gave readers a greater understanding of the proceedings. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Differences in Chinese and English-language press were particularly apparent during the trial. The reporter from the Chinese newspaper Sing Tao, covered the trial from start to finish, often arriving at the courthouse at the same time as the defendants and remaining until everyone had left. Her reports provided details that Ledger articles omitted, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> including descriptions that undercut the officers' claims that they felt threatened during the encounter. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her reports also pointed out contradictions in Officer Curtis' testimony during cross-examination. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her foreboding about the lack of impact of key defense strategies, such as the introduction of the turret tape, photographs taken at the scene, and the booking sheets, captured the mood of those present though the trial. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further capturing the case's ultimate impact on the Asian American community at large, Sing Tao wrote on day five of the trial: &quot;police put fear in the people who will from now on be afraid to enter Quincy.&quot; Similar accounts of the trial were reported in other Chinese-language newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detailed Chinese press coverage enabled the readers to understand the injustice of the verdict and sentencing. One reader, in response to the articles, even showed up in front of the Quincy District Court to protest. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*106]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In contrast, readers who had access only to the English press believed that the three who were convicted deserved the harsh sentences, as evidenced by electronic messages sent to the Support Committee. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VII. The Trial Revisited<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The Quincy 4 case was decided by a jury of five Whites and one African American. The jury pool was drawn from Norfolk County, a larger geographic area than Quincy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the Support Committee were concerned that on the first day, there was not a single person of color in the jury pool. At the conclusion of jury selection on the second day, when one African American woman joined the jury, the Support Committee concluded that one person of color was better than none. This seeming imbalance is reminiscent of the 1854 California Supreme Court decision People v. Hall. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Jury Selection: Echoes of People v. Hall<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In People v. Hall, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n136</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the California Supreme Court nullified the testimonies of Chinese witnesses in an earlier conviction of a white defendant's murder of a Chinese man. As a matter of public policy, the Hall Court was concerned that &quot;the same rule which would admit [the Chinese] to testify, would admit them to all the equal rights of citizenship, and we might soon see them at the polls, in the jury box, upon the bench, and in our legislative halls.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n137</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Court continued,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The anomalous spectacle of a distinct people [i.e. the Chinese], living in &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*107]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  our community, recognizing no laws of this State, except through necessity, bringing with them their prejudices and national feuds, in which they indulge in open violation of law; whose mendacity is proverbial; a race of people whom nature has marked as inferior, and who are incapable of progress or intellectual development beyond a certain point, as their history has shown; differing in language, opinions, color, and physical conformation; between whom and ourselves nature has placed an impassable difference, is now presented, and for them is claimed, not only the right to swear away the life of a [white] citizen, but the further privilege of participating with us in administering the affairs of our Government. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n138</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> More than 150 years since the Hall decision, the Quincy 4 case came down to weighing the veracity of one Chinese female witness against that of six white police officers. Furthermore, with the exception of the one African American juror in the Quincy 4 trial, the racial composition of the jury had not changed. The four Asian American defendants in this case were tried by a jury that did not reflect their racial diversity. This gives rise to questions of the degree to which racial stereotypes played a part in the police and prosecution's strategies, as well as in the jury deliberation room - and how such stereotypes might have impacted the outcome of this case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n139</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Strategies of Police and Prosecution<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The police reports and the officers' testimonies strongly suggested that the four defendants were aggressors who compelled Officer Curtis to use pepper spray and forcibly restrain Karen. For instance, Officer Curtis testified that he stood by the open car door, caught the door with his foot, and trapped Quan between the door and the car. Curtis then grabbed Quan's wrist and used the pepper spray in his face. Seconds later, as he was pulling Quan from behind the car door, he saw Karen leap in and hit her with his hip as she tried to grab Quan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n140</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the stand, Officer Curtis justified his use of force by claiming that he became fearful when Tat and Howard put up a &quot;fighter stance&quot; to challenge him. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n141</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Officer's claims invoked the stereotype that all Asians know kung fu and are thus dangerous even when unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*108]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Kuan Chung Kao and the Kung Fu Fighter Stereotype<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Asians have long been stereotyped as dangerous &quot;kung fu fighters&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n142</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who need to be restrained by police force. In 1997, in Rohnert Park, California, Kuan Chung Kao fell victim to this stereotype when he was shot in the chest by a deputy while waving a broomstick. The Sheriff's Department issued a press release to justify the police officer's action on the grounds that Kao was &quot;brandishing a stick in a threatening martial arts fashion.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n143</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This nine-page press release contained many references to martial arts, including a neighbor's claim that Kao had been spinning the stick &quot;in a manner consistent with a &quot;Ninja Fighter'&quot; and had been standing in a &quot;Samurai warrior-type stance.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n144</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The officers involved in the Quincy 4 incident, in a similar vein, described (in the police report and on the witness stand) the Quincy 4 as unreasonably dangerous, thus justifying their use of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">i. Depictions of the Quincy 4 as Asian Kung Fu Fighters at Trial<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Quincy Police Officer Curtis wrote about the incident in the following manner:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The males took positions on each side of Karen Chen. Karen Chen had Tat Yuen to her right and Howard Ng to her left. All three, Tat Yuen, Karen Chen and Howard Ng started to surge forward towards me. I was threatened by their actions and in fear of being attacked. I held up my pepper spray in my left hand and pointed it at Tat Yuen, Karen Chen, and Howard Ng ... . Tat Yuen had both fists clenched and up in front of him. His facial expressions were wild and angry. He got into a fighters [sic] stance, straight on and approached me. Karen Chen, with Tat Yuen at her side, was screaming, &quot;&quot;fuck you, you sprayed me!&quot;&quot; Karen Chen's facial expression was also wild and angry. She too approached me in a threatening manner. Howard Ng had both arms extended with his fists clenched. He also got into a fighters [sic] stance. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n145</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Although portions of the above statement were inconsistent with Officer Curtis' report and testimony, as well as with the other officers' descriptions, all accounts depicted the defendants as wild-eyed kung fu fighters. Another common theme is the implicit notion that just one Asian fighter, even if hurt or incapacitated, can overcome numerous armed opponents:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>...Patrolman Wilbur and I completed handcuffing Karen Chen. Upon arrival of the ambulance that I had called, I escorted Karen Chen over to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*109]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the EMT's to have her treated for exposure to pepper spray. As I walked her over to the ambulance, Karen Chen continued to yell, swear and threaten to &quot;get me!' She was yelling to the others who were not under arrest to help her. Karen Chen was acting violently and she was very unpredictable. I felt that having her treated at this time was a physical risk to the ambulance personnel. The transport wagon was on scene. I told the EMT to respond to the police station cell block where they could treat Karen Chen more securely. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n146</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> During the trial, Officer Curtis repeated this description. Another officer agreed with Curtis in his report, explaining why it took three police officers to handcuff a petite Asian woman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>I then grabbed Chen by the arm and she went crazy, Chen began violently kicking and trying to punch me. Officer Curtis came over and grabbed Chen to assist me. Officer Curtis and myself brought Chen to the ground to immobilize her. Officer Curtis had gotten a handcuff on her right wrist and she pulled her arm away and locked her arms together in front of her body and began kicking towards us as she was on the ground. I placed my knee on her shoulder blade and attempted several times to break her grip without hurting her arm. Chen was actively resisting and we were still unable to break her grip on the handcuffs. Officer Mahoney came over to assist us as Chen violently struggled with us. Finally after several moments Officer Curtis managed to get her to release her grip and she was handcuffed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n147</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> The over-dramatized depiction of the Quincy 4's supposed violent tendencies indicates a prosecutorial strategy to sell this &quot;kung fu fighter&quot; stereotype to a non-Asian jury. This stereotypical image served to justify the need for three police officers to take down Karen Chen, as she was only half cuffed - she might have used the metal handcuff as a weapon. Neither the police nor the prosecutor mentioned that Karen weighed under 100 pounds, stood just over five-feet tall, was untrained in martial arts, and that Curtis was more than twice her size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VIII. The Verdict and the Aftermath: Silencing of the Asian American Community<BR>&nbsp;<BR> When the case was handed over to the jury on a Friday afternoon, we correctly feared that the defendants would fall victims to &quot;speedy justice.&quot; Around 3:30 p.m., the jury returned to the courtroom to seek instructions on the many confusing statutory elements of each charge. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n148</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*110]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the verdict came in at 4:45 p.m., we were collectively relieved by Howard's acquittal. He was released and led from the courtroom. Supporters of the Quincy 4 were quickly stunned, however, by the convictions of the other three defendants. Quan was convicted on both charges, Karen of resisting arrest, and Tat of disorderly conduct. The court then moved to sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the Assistant District Attorney's recommendation of probation for all three defendants, the judge ordered ten days of jail time each for Quan and Tat, to begin immediately. Quan was handcuffed and whisked away by a court officer. When he came out of the room he held up his cuffed hands so the supporters in the hallway </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n149</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could witness the injustice. Tat followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten days, in a criminal justice system that has issued far harsher punishments on other victims, is nothing. Yet given our knowledge of the Quincy 4's innocence, it was difficult to contemplate a guilty verdict, much less jail time. Furthermore, based on our legal knowledge of the typical sentence in similar cases, and witnessing the lenient disposition of other misdemeanor and simple felony cases in the same court by the same judge, most of us expected the usual probation and fines, as the Assistant District Attorney recommended. It was clear to us that by sentencing Quan and Tat to jail, the judge intended not only to punish these two, but also to punish and silence their supporters in attendance. If there was some logic behind the sentencing and the judge's use of discretion to exceed the prosecution's requests, it was not made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community had come full circle. Twenty years earlier, presiding Judge Albert Kramer of the Quincy District Court had encouraged Asian Americans to come forward as witnesses and participants in the judicial process. In commenting on why they should do so in hate crime cases, Judge Kramer said, &quot;[Asian Americans] find living with these things is far more dangerous than attempting to deal with it ... . [by not coming forward,] it sends a message that attacking them is fine because you won't get caught.&quot; Suggesting that Asian Americans can play a role in securing strict court sentences, he added, &quot;If you come to court, we have to show you the experience is worth the risk.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n150</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, the Asian American community was more than highly visible. The Quincy 4 supporters came out en masse, made themselves visible in protests and rallies, and attended the trial and hearings religiously. These were not the docile, unassuming Asian Americans to which Quincy's white inhabitants were accustomed. The harsh sentences given to the Quincy 4 &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*111]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  might be viewed as a statement by the court to future Asian American litigants: do not waste the court's time with a trivial case; take the plea bargain or take a settlement; if you do not cooperate and you are unlucky enough to come before me for sentencing, be forewarned. The harsh sentences were deterrents for future defendants seeking justice through the criminal process. As with the initial criminal matter in the Vincent Chin case, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n151</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Quincy court seemed primarily concerned with the administrative efficiency of its docket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Attempt to Tell Our Story Through a Public Letter: Fiasco with the Quincy Sun<BR>&nbsp;<BR> One post-trial resolution adopted by the Quincy 4 Support Committee was to publish a letter in the mainstream media to voice our outrage regarding the case's outcome. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n152</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only news outlet in which the Support Committee could afford to publish was a local newspaper that circulated within Quincy. The letter, to be published as an advertisement, read:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>For fourteen months, we have supported four Asian Americans (Karen Chen, Howard Ng, Quan Thin and Tat Yuen) in their quest to clear their names after being pepper-sprayed and beaten up by several Quincy police officers and then prosecuted for crimes that they insisted they did not commit.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>On June 22, 2007, after a five-day trial, the jury cleared the charge against Howard Ng, but found the other three guilty of either disorderly conduct, or resisting arrest, or both. We disagree with the guilty verdicts returned by the jury. The four remain adamant that they were falsely charged after being victims of police brutality in the early hours of April 30, 2006.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>We are outraged by the disproportionately harsh sentences that Judge Orfanello handed down. Judge Orfanello issued sentences that far exceeded the prosecutor's recommendation, which did not include any jail time for anyone. Despite the fact that Thin and Yuen have no prior criminal records, Judge Orfanello ordered their immediate incarceration to serve 10 days of the six-month suspended sentence and two years' probation for resisting arrest and/or disorderly conduct. They were not even allowed a moment to speak to their family members who were waiting in court. Likewise, Judge Orfanello placed Chen under a lengthy 18-month probation for her first conviction. In delivering the above sentences, Judge Orfanello provided no basis or reasoning to support such harsh punishment that did not fit the crimes alleged. We see this as a punishment of these individuals for exercising their constitutional right to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*112]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  have their day in court.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>We stand by these four individuals in their proclamation of their innocence and we demand no retaliation against them or their families, or any others in the Asian American community, for standing up for their rights. We will not tolerate any unfair treatment toward any Asian Americans.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The morning after the Support Committee placed the advertisement, co-author Lai received a call from the paper's advertising sales agent, who asked that the Support Committee omit &quot;being pepper sprayed and beaten by&quot; because, according to her, this was inconsistent with the police reports. The sales agent further asked that the CPA be listed as the entity that paid for the advertisement complete with its contact information, since CPA was the source of the check used to pay for the advertisement. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n153</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Co-author Lai pointed out that the police report was only one version of the account and that the police officer himself testified in court that he had used pepper spray and physical force. The sales agent then claimed that the individuals were pepper sprayed only after they attacked the police, and that the newspaper's legal counsel strongly suggested removal of those references. She also insisted that the entity placing the advertisement was legally required to list its full identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-author Lai protested, defending the accuracy of her version of the incident and explaining that the advertisement was paid for by the Quincy 4 Support Committee, with the Chinese Progressive Association acting as its fiscal agent. Ultimately unwilling to publish an advertisement with censored content, the Support Committee withdrew the placement. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n154</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This censorship attempt itself was troubling. Even more troubling was the fact that this small newspaper went to the trouble of studying the police reports &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*113]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and seeking clearance with its lawyer within twenty-four hours of receiving the placement; this suggested that the Quincy 4 incident was far more significant to the City than the level of mainstream media exposure suggested. Regardless, the controversial nature of the case revealed the latent tensions between Quincy's Asian American and white residents. It also suggested that Asian American residents who claimed otherwise were deluding themselves. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n155</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Would the Verdict be Different Had We Not Organized?<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The proper question is whether we were right to organize around the case at all. We believe the answer is an unconditional &quot;yes,&quot; stemming from lessons learned from our collective history as Asian Americans fighting injustice. Discrimination inherent in law does not disappear simply because legal or political decision makers suddenly realize what is right and fair. Legal changes entail the exercise of advocacy skills: litigation, lobbying, organizing, and education. To overlook the need for such activism is to remain mentally locked, hoping for the best while doing nothing to work toward progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another question to ask is whether the sentences would have been more lenient if the community had not organized. The answer here is &quot;yes.&quot; Based on our collective legal experience, we have surmised that the court prioritizes efficiency. Therefore, had the defendants apologized to the officers who brutalized them and signed away their claims, the case would have been resolved. The defendants rejected this compromise, however, based on their conviction that they had done no wrong and owed no apology. Admitting guilt would have been easier for the individual victims, but not necessarily better for the collective good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*114]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What if Yick Wo </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n156</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had not sued the City of San Francisco? What if Rosa Parks had simply moved to the back of the bus? Progress is incompatible with &quot;the easy way out.&quot; And if one were concerned about being convicted and having a criminal record, the Quincy 4 would have role models in Fred Korematsu, Min Yasui, and Gordon Hirabayashi to follow. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n157</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IX. Lessons for the Asian American Community in Organizing for Change<BR>&nbsp;<BR> As previously discussed, the Quincy 4 case occurred at an inopportune moment. Various circumstances conspired to create a vacuum of leadership from the community in the Support Committee. Co-author Lai took it upon herself to chair the Support Committee during the summer of 2006, coordinating the campaign until the CPA and others could take over. Throughout the campaign, the Support Committee had a fluid membership, with CPA personnel becoming de facto campaign staffers. This decentralized structure made it difficult to map out strategies or to make decisions. Unlike the organizers in the Long Guang Huang case, who rallied supporters from across the political spectrum by depicting the incident as an attack on all Asian Americans, the Quincy 4 Support Committee failed to convey that message. In this case, there was no unity among Asian American constituencies, nor any agreement within the Support Committee on broader systemic issues that should be challenged. As a result, the Support Committee became a task-oriented operation focused only on planning rallies and court hearings; the campaign lacked any full strategy discussion or contingency plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Mobilizing Groups<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Throughout the Quincy 4 case, the Support Committee used a variety of methods: old-fashioned literature drops, notices in organizational newsletters, and phone banking; as well as mass e-mails, websites, and blogs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial goal of the campaign was to challenge inequality and racial discrimination in Quincy. Another goal of the outreach was to build a cross-racial and ethnic coalition focusing on misuse of police authority and to demand better accountability and racial justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*115]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Essentially, four groups were consistently present during the yearlong ordeal, most notably a group of elderly Chinese immigrants, based in Chinatown, who knew Karen and had a long history of working with the CPA - namely in struggles for community preservation, tenant rights, immigrant rights, worker rights, and voting rights. More importantly, these Chinatown-based supporters understood the history of discrimination, knew of the Long Guang Huang case, and readily perceived the Quincy 4 case as yet another incident of anti-Asian racism. Hoping that the American legal system would dispense justice for the four victims, these supporters maintained a strong courtroom presence throughout the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other consistently supportive community partners included lawyers from Greater Boston Legal Services, organizers from the Center to Support Immigrant Organizing, members of the Institute for Asian American Studies and the Asian American Resource Workshop, and various labor groups and organizers. As part of the local social justice network, these groups were naturally invested in the case's outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Support Committee made a special concerted effort to reach out to Asian American youth - from high school students to young professionals - through e-mail listservs, websites, and blogs. Involving this constituency was crucial because its members represented the future of the progressive movement, and because the issue of police harassment of young people of color should resonate most strongly with them. However, this demographic proved to be the most skeptical and least engaged in the cause. Aside from those college students affiliated with the CPA youth program and the Coalition of Asian Pacific American Youth, including a handful who drove through the night to attend the court hearing in the morning, most local college students were apathetic. The young people became more active after the verdict; they began attending Support Committee meetings, helping to develop the agenda, facilitating small group discussions, and participating in long-term strategy discussions. But even then, the enthusiasm was short-lived; it lasted only through the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Quincy 4 case drew additional support from groups beyond the Asian American community - most notably from the supporters of the Somerville 5. Also, candidates for state and local offices made brief shows of support during the ordeal. Their numbers were small, but their presence was noted in media coverage of the case. Representatives from Militant Labor also participated. Various individuals who learned of the case through e-mail or by word of mouth also lent support, including a Catholic nun from Quincy who heard about the case through the Support Committee's outreach for the May 2006 community event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notably absent from this support network were community leaders from the Quincy Asian American community, mainstream civil rights organizations, Chinatown social service organizations, and Asian American &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*116]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  politicians. Their absence cannot be explained by ignorance of the case or inadequacy of notice; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n158</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> many voiced opinions about organizing or legal defense after the verdict. Indeed, the absence of these groups during crucial moments of the struggle made their post hoc offers to help appear self-serving and hollow. The lack of support from these mainstream groups suggests that perhaps civil rights is still viewed as a Black and White issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Use of Internet: Its Limitation as an Outreach Strategy<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Much more so than in the case involving Long Guang Huang, information technology played a key role in outreach and organizing around the Quincy 4 case. However, the core supporters of the Quincy 4 turned out to be the elderly, whom the Support Committee organized through old-fashioned phone banking. Though notifications about the rally and court hearing were sent to hundreds of listserv recipients, overall, outreach to young Asian Americans by electronic means was not particularly effective. Young Asian Americans were far less consistent in event attendance and overall support than were older supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Lack of Asian Americans Serving Jury Duty<BR>&nbsp;<BR> As experienced legal services attorneys, the authors have helped numerous Asian immigrants seek waivers from jury duty service based on limited English-language proficiency. However, Norfolk County, which encompasses Quincy, is home to many Asians who are not limited in English proficiency. Norfolk includes more than 50,000 persons of Asian descent who collectively represent 7.7% of the county's population. Given these statistics, the utter lack of Asians in the jury pool of thirty-seven for this case was suspect. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n159</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many immigrants wish to be naturalized so they can enjoy the full rights of citizenship. The desire to sponsor their families may be pertinent for most, but we have also encouraged many immigrants to become citizens in order to &quot;get out the (Asian) vote,&quot; and even urged citizen members of our community to run for public office. Yet, we at times had forgotten to remind these prospective American citizens that full political participation includes jury duty. Recognizing that Asian immigrants are often intimidated by the language barrier, we must develop a national initiative for Asian America that embraces jury duty as a component of civic participation. We must keep in mind the Hall court's racist language &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*117]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as a call to full political engagement by Asian Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Realities That We Cannot Overcome<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In previous organizing attempts - i.e., around land use, voting rights, immigrant rights, tenants' rights, and workers' rights - filing suit, or threatening to do so, was a tool of last resort, which the community could invoke upon exhaustion of other conflict resolution channels. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n160</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Quincy 4 case, not only was the lawsuit filed at the onset of organizing, but it was also a criminal prosecution that proceeded swiftly and held the potential of great detriment to those involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the community's previous experiences organizing around Long Guang Huang, gathering support for the Quincy 4 presented novel challenges. First, there were no third-party non-Asian witnesses to the incident </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n161</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who could corroborate the Quincy 4's account; this situation pit the police's version against that of the defendants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n162</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, being young Asian Americans, the victims did not necessarily evoke as sympathetic an image as the elderly Mr. Huang did.. Third, Karen's position as a CPA organizer worked against her. Within the Asian American community, this affiliation turned away some who felt that CPA was too radical in its approach (even though it had won many campaigns for workers, tenants, and voters in the Chinatown community). Beyond Asian American and progressive communities, Karen's work as an organizer could be perceived as troublemaking. Such perceptions led some to believe that she had either provoked the attack or played the race card to malign the City of Quincy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n163</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the Quincy Asian American community and the City of Quincy were not ready to tackle the issue of local racial tensions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n164</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*118]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite our determination not to let litigation drive community organizing, the Quincy Asian American community needed a moral victory in the criminal case before attempting to address more fundamental issues. However, the drawn-out process eventually sapped the community's optimism and, as a result, the Quincy Asian American community settled back in where it began - sitting on the sidelines, waiting for lawyers to deliver results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Trying to Serve Two Masters: Community Versus Defendant Interests<BR>&nbsp;<BR> On many occasions, the interests of individual members of the Quincy 4 differed and even clashed with those of the Asian American community as a whole. For example, although many community members supported the Quincy 4, many others doubted their innocence. To the extent that the latter questioned the Quincy 4's intent in pursuing the case and even their truthfulness, it would have been easier for members of the Quincy 4 to &quot;take a deal&quot; with the prosecution rather than face public scrutiny. A principal goal of the Support Committee was to balance these two interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To protect their own interests, the Quincy 4 defendants retained separate lawyers, each of whom was charged with promoting his or her client's best interest. As a result, the defense team collectively had little interest in the community's stake. Yet, in the Support Committee's perspective, this case had to be approached from both an individual and a community front. The defendants met with their respective lawyers, but these meetings were usually preceded or followed by discussion, debriefing, or strategizing amongst the Quincy 4 and a subset of the Support Committee. Further, the co-authors often explained legal processes and the impact of various strategies to the defendants, reviewing court documents with them and preparing them with trial scenarios when they could not meet with their lawyers. Through these group sessions, the Quincy 4 tried to reach common understandings as to the next steps in collective action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Support Committee's task of balancing the community's and the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*119]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendants' individual interests was difficult. In cases of conflicting interests, we usually decided in favor of the individuals who faced potential conviction. In turn, defendants had to consider the actions and strategies according to their own personal beliefs on what would be best for them individually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One particular instance aptly exemplifies this conflict. The day after the convictions were handed down, a scheduled event to commemorate Vincent Chin's death occurred; clips of &quot;Who Killed Vincent Chin?&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n165</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were shown and key parts interpreted to a packed room consisting primarily of Chinese-speaking audience. Dismay at the Quincy 4 outcome, combined with outrage at the injustices of the Chin case, led to discussions about holding a protest in front of the courthouse to demonstrate to the judge that, though she might incarcerate individual Asian American defendants, she could not silence the Asian American community. The Chinese press were present and published this announcement in the newspapers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n166</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, we were forced to cancel this protest out of concern for the safety of Quan and Tat, who remained in jail. Their families were concerned that the protest may cause the court to punish them further by increasing their sentences. Apparent ties between the police and correctional facility personnel contributed to the fear that Quan and Tat would be mistreated. Since we had no means of directly contacting Quan or Tat, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n167</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> we had no idea whether they would favor such a protest. Thus, we decided to postpone the protest to assuage their families' fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this situation, serving the immediate needs of Quan and Tat did not serve those of the community. Clearly, the Asian American community was silenced by the convictions and the sentences, and they desired a quick outlet to demonstrate their anger, frustration, disbelief, and distrust in the judicial system. By putting off the protest, we lost critical momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">X. Lessons for Community Lawyers<BR>&nbsp;<BR> As lawyers, we have worked on many occasions with organizers to support the community's struggle for justice and equality. We are proud to lend our legal training and knowledge to support mobilization for causes such as equitable land use, environmental justice, and immigrant rights. However, the Quincy 4 case presented us with new challenges and new &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*120]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lessons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Organizer Versus Lawyer - Where Do Our Skills Lie?<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Although it was necessary for co-author Lai to assume the organizer role, leading the Support Committee violated a cardinal rule of community lawyering: a lawyer should not organize, let alone lead, a campaign or chair a Support Committee. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n168</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As is generally the case, the dual role of lawyer and organizer was problematic since organizing strategies often conflicted with legal considerations. For example, from an organizer's perspective, it would have helped organizing efforts for the victims to share their stories with the community; however, a lawyer would counsel the defendants to stay silent on details so as to avoid damaging their case. The lawyer's role is to protect the defendant's and not community's interests. Such conflicts persisted throughout the Quincy 4 case. We have learned that we cannot effectively serve two masters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the Support Committee often spoke to the community and press on behalf of the defendants who could not do so on their own. As chairperson during the pivotal initial months of the campaign, co-author Lai assumed this responsibility. This violated yet another important rule of community lawyering: never do for people what they can do themselves. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n169</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Resisting the Seduction of Power: Playing the Supporting Versus Lead Role<BR>&nbsp;<BR> On many occasions, the co-authors could have led the campaign in various ways. The community often looked to us to lead because we are lawyers and speak English. As professionals, we have been trained to lead and act as spokespersons. The potential for self-aggrandizement could have led us astray from the basic principles under which we have practiced for so many years: community lawyering is about empowering ordinary people to speak and act. We believe that, given the opportunity, people can speak for themselves. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n170</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On many occasions, it would have been easier and more efficient for us to speak or act on behalf of the community and then report back, but we consciously resisted this temptation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A case in point was the meeting with Quincy's Mayor. The co-authors were thrust into a situation as unelected delegates to speak with the Mayor. We could have easily met with him as representatives of the group and relayed the message to the community afterward. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n171</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, we steadfastly communicated that the supporters were waiting downstairs to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*121]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  meet with the Mayor. In the end, a room full of community members and diverse supporters all conversed with him. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n172</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To accentuate the co-authors' role as only facilitators, co-author Lai stepped away from the table and interpreted for many who had limited English proficiency. In such a situation, others employing a different model of empowerment might have met alone with the Mayor, thus silencing the supporters' voices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As community lawyers, the co-authors believe that one of our main roles is that of a facilitator who allows the community to speak for itself. We knew that the community had been through multiple struggles and that its voice was as eloquent as ours if given the opportunity to exercise its power. This is the essential difference between the community lawyering model and an approach in which lawyers assume power to &quot;speak on behalf of the community&quot; on the implicit premise that the community is not sophisticated enough to address the issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, in brokering this meeting, we emboldened community members to realize that they had the right to be there and express their opinions to the Mayor. The Mayor's invitation for the group to come to his office was an affront to the receptionist who would have barred the community, and to the waiting Quincy police who expected to enforce the blockade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Conducting Impromptu Community Legal Education About the Legal Process Through Court House Debriefing<BR>&nbsp;<BR> One key organizing principle was to support the defendants in the legal processes. For many observers, pre-trial hearings were their first exposure to the American court system. Prior to the first pre-trial hearing, the Support Committee briefed community observers on what to expect and advised them of courtroom etiquette. Yet, even for those who spoke English, the courtroom exchanges between the judge and the lawyers proved unintelligibly technical. Thus, after the first hearing, the Support Committee held bilingual debriefing sessions and began a series of impromptu bilingual community trainings on the American justice system. These sessions not only provided updates on the Quincy 4 case, but also explained how the court handled the other calendared cases witnessed by supporters. In these sessions the community learned about civil versus criminal systems, plea bargains, sentencing, and the limits of the criminal system's endeavors to punish and rehabilitate. These debriefings became the most valuable form of community legal education used during the Quincy 4 case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n173</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*122]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. Ensuring Access and Protecting Rights by Bridging Linguistic and Cultural Gaps<BR>&nbsp;<BR> As community lawyers, the co-authors are often called upon to bridge language barriers between the English-speaking world and limited-English-proficient clients and community members. The mantra of allowing ordinary people to speak for themselves is meaningless if they cannot communicate with the audience or understand the situation in which they must speak. As well, inability to understand rules and regulations governing the courtroom can cause misunderstanding and undue embarrassment for the limited-English-proficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Quincy 4 case, co-author Lai had, on numerous occasions, interpreted the instructions from the court officers and judge. Basic instructions prohibiting cellular phones, beverages, gum chewing, newspaper reading, and wearing of hats would have been missed and could have led to unnecessary furor or punishment from the bench, had co-author Lai not been there to interpret. These are minor details that the English-speaking public would not consider barriers to the courthouse, but they were important considerations for the Quincy 4 supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, bridging the communication gap involves interpreting cultural nuances beyond linguistics. During post-hearing debriefings, we addressed everything that transpired in court to provide a holistic perspective on how the system works. For instance, community members wondered why police officers who came to support their own case were allowed to stand despite the judge's &quot;no standing&quot; order. Or, more bewilderingly, why police officers were allowed to sit in front of the lawyer's bar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n174</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> next to the prosecution. Our answers to these questions dispelled idealistic views about American equality. Explanation of these minute issues helped reinforce the notion that the justice system does not just dispense equal justice unless people monitor and challenge it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&quot;Putting Race Back on the Table&quot;: Civil Rights is an Asian American Issue<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In the twenty-five years since the Vincent Chin case, the Asian American community has developed tremendously. Most notably, it has organized and developed its political clout. With the emergence of Asian Americans as players on the political front, and as well on multiple public policy fronts, issues that most immediately impact community members, such as anti-Asian violence, have taken a backseat. We must revisit the recommendations made over twenty years ago regarding anti-Asian violence. These recommendations include: (1) local and state government &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*123]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  review of whether their laws adequately protect Asian Americans' rights; (2) concerted efforts by the media to raise public awareness of incidences of anti-Asian violence, (3) restraint by political leaders from using &quot;race-baiting&quot; tactics in election campaigns; (4) coordinated national efforts to promote understanding of Asian Americans and to ensure the successful implementation of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, (5) training of local law enforcement to properly implement the Hate Crimes Statistics Act; (6) an increase in Asian American representation on police forces; (7) availability of interpreter services to limited-English-proficient Asian Americans in police departments; (8) establishment of police department and civilian review boards to actively monitor allegations of police harassment and brutality; and (9) police departments' adoption of community policing methods to build trust with Asian American community. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n175</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Americans still approach civil rights issues within a Black/White paradigm; unfortunately, it takes a tragedy like Vincent Chin's murder for mainstream society to link civil rights with Asian Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Need for Dedicated Resources to Tackle Anti-Asian Violence<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Following the Vincent Chin case, Asian Americans experienced an alarming increase in anti-Asian hate crimes. Finally, in this context of heightened violence, the Asian American community united to organize around hate crimes and related issues. Advocacy efforts arose on local, state, and national fronts to establish watch groups, hold hearings, enact legislation, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n176</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and to place civil rights officers in law enforcement positions ranging from those of local police to district attorney, attorney general, and other federal offices. On a community level, organizations such as the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence (&quot;CAAAV&quot;) in New York City were established to mobilize the Asian community. Over time, reflecting a broader trend across Asian America, CAAAV transformed into an organization fighting broader systemic injustices. This expansion of focus into other pressing policy issues naturally siphoned off resources from the issue at hand. Moreover, an exclusive focus on Anti-Asian violence may not have been financially feasible for these community-based &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*124]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  organizations, given their reliance on private foundations for support. Private donors interested in providing seed money to launch anti-hate crime initiatives may have been reluctant to devote too many resources over time to hate crime-related issues given the statistical trends For example, the 2002 hate crime audit report by the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium (&quot;NAPALC&quot;) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n177</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> noted a drop in hate crime rates. This drop arguably reflected not a decrease in incidents but less reporting by victims who feared anti-terrorism government policies. As a result, fewer resources have been devoted to tackling anti-Asian violence. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n178</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the late 1980s, the Norfolk County District Attorney's Office heralded a Civil Rights Office that had an Asian American liaison, but this position disappeared by the late 1990s. The ebb and flow in resources for addressing anti-Asian violence, locally and nationally, suggest that when we identify certain conditions as an emergency, mainstream authorities will respond with services or resource; however, once the incident fades into the past and community pressures slacken, programs and remedies are eliminated by cost-cutting measures. It has been suggested that, to counter the decline in resources allocated for hate crime prevention, we need to focus on increasing Asian American presence in the system through an increase in the number of Asian American police officers, political officials, and legal professionals. Such increase in representation is desirable, but it is an indirect and long-term solution for an urgent problem. In addition, no increase in Asian American personnel will automatically sensitize and change the flawed system. An adequate solution should incorporate not only this long-term indirect systemic approach, but also the programs initiated in the late 1980s that provided for staff experts on hate crimes. Moreover, in view of the link between anti-immigrant sentiments and anti-Asian hate crimes, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n179</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> staff should be trained in immigration issues as well. As we struggle for these changes, we must keep our discourse focused on the underlying racial animus that drives hate crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">F. Defining Success in the Face of Failure<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In the wake of disappointing verdicts and excessively harsh sentencing, it has been difficult to find success in the Quincy 4 case. Yet, as community lawyers and activists, we know that success is not solely defined by the immediate outcome of a case. As lawyers for Japanese American internees and for initial civil rights claimants did not see immediate results, we may not see success spring from the Quincy 4 case &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*125]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for many years. What is important in movement building is for participants to understand that if it were not for them and their supporters, many more Asian Americans might have been victimized. The hope is that the next time police officers stop an Asian American, they will think twice about their behavior and its consequences before they act. A pessimist might conclude that this case's outcomes would embolden police to terrorize the Asian American community. But the case's aftermath indicates otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the rally planned for the Tuesday after the trial was cancelled, the notice did not reach everyone. The Chinese press publicized the rally and reported that some people showed up. One photograph published by the Chinese newspaper showed a middle-aged Asian man in front of the Quincy Court House </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n180</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> engaging in symbolic protest by taping his mouth and &quot;handcuffing&quot; his hands in duct tape. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n181</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This man's actions evidence the community's refusal to be silenced and the way in which the Quincy 4 case has bolstered the community's protest against injustice. Even more significant is that this man had the courage to protest alone. Prior to the Quincy 4 incident, nothing like this show of bravery would have even been fathomable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, a few weeks after the decision, the CPA received a complaint from an Asian American homeowner in Quincy about discrimination from her condominium manager, who demanded that she secure unnecessary permits, including an elevator use permit (she lived on the ground floor), before she could move in. Meanwhile, her white husband (the manager was unaware of their relationship) was given free rein to move in without hassle. The incident raises several questions: (1) Why did the victim not report the incident to any Quincy Asian American organizations; and (2) Why did she contact the CPA instead? The fact that she came forward indicated that she was willing to fight this injustice, and her approaching the CPA in Boston suggested that she knew the organization would advocate for her as it had for the Quincy 4 - in ways that Quincy Asian American organizations might not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both examples indicate that the Quincy 4 case has raised consciousness about racial discrimination suffered by Asian Americans. Further, such awareness led to direct action in both instances. But for the visible courage of the Quincy 4, these instances and many more might not have happened. Taken together, these instances indicate progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">XI. Conclusion<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Today, twenty-five years after the Vincent Chin case, anti-Asian &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*126]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sentiments persist. A simple sign written in a non-English-language, intended as a service to linguistic minorities, is seen by the Whites as a threat. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n182</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This language issue has been complicated by feelings and displays of cultural pride. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n183</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One 2006 incident continues to plague an organization that flew a People's Republic of China flag alongside an American flag at its office. The issue stirred controversy from veteran groups who opposed the sight of a communist flag next to the American flag. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n184</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ward 6 Councilor Brian McNamee remarked during a city council hearing, &quot;If you want to live in America, don't be a hyphenated American, don't keep one foot planted in your country of birth and another in this country. Put both feet firmly in America.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n185</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Responding to the news that the Chinese flagpole had been hacked, one resident wrote in a letter to the editor, &quot;But for the people who lost their flagpole to what is called vandals and continue to fly the Communist banner over Beal and Hancock Streets in Quincy, they call it vandalism. I call what the people did, Patriots. This country is known as a democracy, not a doctoral [sic] state, as is China. If the Chinese United Association wants to fly the Communist banner, let them fly it over their home property - China - not here in the United States of America.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n186</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These comments by white protesters reveal aversion to local diversity. Whereas it may be acceptable to describe European Americans as Italian Americans or Irish Americans, the same cannot be said for Asian Americans. Meanwhile, Irish flags are commonly found hanging in Quincy pubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Mary Orfanello's sentence may have been a blessing in disguise. Had she accepted the Assistant District Attorney's recommendation for probation and no jail time, the case would have &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*127]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  disappeared and the cause for further organizing would have vanished. Instead, her excessive sentences outraged the Asian American community, just as the decision in Vincent Chin's criminal trial did. Even people who were unfamiliar with the judicial system found it extraordinary that defendants who were being convicted for minor infractions, and who had no prior records, were given jail time. Moreover, the harshness of the sentences may have awakened to action some Asian Americans who were previously skeptical about the defendants' innocence or about the Support Committee's strategies. Hopefully these skeptics have realized that silence, inactivity, and capitulation do not wear out injustice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although three of the Quincy 4 were convicted, the great achievement in the case has been the collective realization that standing up to challenge the powers that be - and the white establishment - is the beginning of victory for our community. It is our hope that if similar situations recur, the police in Quincy and beyond will act differently toward Asian Americans. This case is not merely about four individuals; it is about America's attitude towards Asian Americans involved in the criminal justice system, and it is about Asian America's attitudes towards people of color - including our own. Our community must realize that when one individual is wrongly incarcerated, we are all wrongly incarcerated. Though the Quincy 4 might have &quot;lost&quot; their case, we must remain vigilant in pressing on toward victory in the fight for equal justice.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c30"><SPAN CLASS="c31">n2. &quot;&nbsp;The Great American Boycott&quot; - El Gran Paro Americano in Spanish, and also known as &quot;the Great American Strike,&quot; and &quot;a day without an immigrant&quot; - was a one-day boycott of schools and businesses by immigrants, both legal and undocumented. It followed the million person march that took place in late March of 2006 during which immigrants and immigrant rights advocates called for humane immigration reform that included legalization for the estimated 12 million people lacking an immigration status in the United States. The date of the boycott was selected to coincide with International Workers' Day, which although not officially recognized in the United States, is celebrated in most parts of the world. The organizers of the strike called for supporters to refrain from buying, selling, working, and attending school in order to demonstrate the economic contribution and impact of both documented and undocumented immigrants. In Los Angeles alone, an estimated crowd of one million took to the streets. Similar demonstrations took place in many cities across the United States. In Massachusetts, there were small scale protests across the state, with an estimated 8,000 Latino students boycotting school.

I told them that I was going to spray them... . [Tat] had both clenched fists up in front of him. The others were right there with him and surging forward. I sprayed these people with a sweeping motion trying to spray all of them.&quot; Robert Curtis, Quincy Police Department Incident Report #620600, at 1-2 (April 30, 2006). The second report filed by Officer Curtis more than five months after the incident contained a more embellished account of that night. In that account, Tat, Karen and Howard were all portrayed as &quot;wild and angry,&quot; as they &quot;surged forward towards [him]&quot; in a &quot;threatening manner,&quot; especially because the two men &quot;got into a fighters stance,&quot; thus forcing him to spray them &quot;using a sweeping motion&quot; after Quan was already sprayed and handcuffed on the hood of the car.

Officer Curtis testified that he only sprayed Quan because Quan swung his fist at him. He also testified that Karen was affected by the pepper spray in the manner she was because she &quot;jumped in the fray&quot; and smudged her face on Quan in the area where he was sprayed. In court, Officer Curtis testified that he used his right foot to tilt open the car door, pinning it onto Quan while he used his right hand to grab Quan's left wrist, holding his pepper spray in his left hand and swaying his hips to the left to bump Karen off him. Officer Curtis claimed that he had warned the individuals that he was going to spray and sprayed a second time only because Tat and Howard approached him in fighters' stance, screaming at him that he had &quot;sprayed a girl,&quot; challenged him to fight, which made him fear for his life. See Trial Notes, supra note 5, at 15. In truth, Tat was still sitting in the second car as Quan, Howard, and Karen were pepper sprayed by Officer Curtis. Tat was not near Joanna's car where the mayhem occurred. See id. at 4-7, 28-30, 36-37. Howard, on the other hand, was positioned between Quan and Karen behind an open car door of the car, and was not in a position to approach Officer Curtis from his back, as the officer claimed. See Joanna Ng, Citizen Complaint of Police Misconduct, at 1-2 (June 6, 2006) (on file with authors) [hereinafter Joanna Ng Complaint]; McGrail Report, supra note 6, at 2 (stating that Karen and Howard were attempting to keep Quan in the car and were still near the passenger door with Quan as Curtis arrived at the scene). </SPAN></P>

Second, they are said to be intelligent and highly educated, though a large number of them are dismissed as math and science geeks. Third, as a group they are seen as economically successful, especially compared to other ethnic minorities, even though they faced severe discrimination in the past and may encounter some (fairly minor) discrimination now. In other words, a regrettable history of past discrimination has not kept them down - and indeed may have spurred them on. Fourth, Asian Americans are described as &quot;assimilating&quot; into mainstream American life - living in the suburbs and intermarrying with whites - well, mostly assimilating, but not entirely ... .<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Id. </SPAN></P>

Larger household size, immigration paths and history, socioeconomic background, and English-language proficiency also play a role in these statistics. In dissecting the discussions that pitch Asian Americans as the &quot;model minority,&quot; one should question whether Asian Americans are being used to malign other groups and to dismantle programs that aim to eradicate the impact of generations of structural racism.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c30"><SPAN CLASS="c31">n155.&nbsp; To help the Quincy 4 Support Committee evaluate the racial environment in Quincy, we conducted an informal survey targeting the residents and users of services in Quincy. Half of the surveys were conducted during Quincy's August Moon festival in 2006, while the other half were distributed and collected through other community venues. The Support Committee collected a total of fifty-six completed surveys, thirty-nine of which were completed by Quincy residents. Forty-eight of the respondents claimed they got along with their neighbors, while five stated that they did not get along with their neighbors because of language or cultural barriers. When asked how often the respondents visited certain public facilities (public library, City Hall, City Council, public school/parent council, police department, public housing authority, and human resources office), the most visited place was the public library, where sixteen respondents said they visited. The least visited places were the City Council and the human resources offices, where only 1 respondent visited with some frequency. Some respondents indicated they had never visited certain public places because they perceived they would be treated either with hostility or be ignored. Six of the thirteen respondents who reported having occasionally visited the police department reported unwelcoming treatment, ranging from being ignored to being treated with hostility. In another part of the survey, thirteen of the respondents reported witnessing police discrimination. In response to the statement, &quot;In Quincy, I feel that I am treated differently because of my race, ethnicity, immigrant status, or English proficiency,&quot; twelve of the respondents answered &quot;agree&quot; or &quot;strongly agree,&quot; while nineteen responded &quot;disagree&quot; or &quot;strongly disagree.&quot; Surveys of Quincy residents (on file with authors). </SPAN></P>

The first involved five Chinese American middle school students who were reportedly attacked by a white student at school. When the co-authors' intern began to investigate, the advocacy group that received the initial complaint, the pastor who ran youth program, and a school guidance counselor who were privy to the facts all refused to discuss the matter. They claimed that the children's parents did not want to publicize the event and that because the attacker was a well-known bully, no racism was involved. The second incident involved the flying of the national flag of the Peoples' Republic of China by a newly-formed organization in Quincy. Although the organization could legally fly the flag, it needed a permit from the City before doing so. The City Council met to discuss how to discourage the organization from flying the flag because it was &quot;a symbol with unfavorable associations for some military veterans and Asian immigrants who fled China's Communist government.&quot; Robert Knox, Flag That Sparked Protest Comes Down: Quincy Awaits Forum on New Chinese Group, Boston Globe, Oct. 22, 2006, at 13; see Christopher Walker, Officials Would Like China Flag Taken Down, Patriot Ledger, Oct. 6, 2006, at 9.
