SOME COLLEGE STUDENTS are organizing protests of the 
 shooting and today's verdict with inflammatory images on the Internet.
A Facebook.com forum created by Jah-Ree Bolivar, 23, of Jackson Heights, Queens, demands "real justice" and includes a photo with the scrawled threat: "Kill KKKops Dead!"
Bolivar, a senior at John Jay College, said his group will peacefully protest at the Queens district attorney's office and local police precincts even if the cops are found guilty.
"Enough's enough," said Bolivar, who is of Colombian descent.
