<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal legislation could follow the acquittal of three detectives who fatally shot an unarmed black man in Queens last year, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan is suggesting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nadler was among eight members of the House of Representatives who joined the Reverend Al Sharpton in a visit to the site of the shooting yesterday afternoon in an effort to pressure the Department of Justice to bring federal charges against the detectives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will be moving on all avenues, in all lanes, to seek justice in this matter,&quot; Rep. Gregory Meeks, who called the meeting, said. &quot;One of those avenues is the federal government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nadler, who called the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;absolutely senseless,&quot; said the group would &quot;be looking to see what we can do - if it's a matter with the Justice Department, if it's a matter of perhaps changing the law so that this tragedy will not have occurred in vain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in the group was the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. John Conyers Jr., who said he had spoken about the case with Attorney General Mukasey yesterday. The Department of Justice has opened an investigation into the case to determine whether to bring charges against the detectives under federal civil rights laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an important moment in the history of the criminal justice system in America,&quot; Mr. Conyers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local officials including a possible mayoral hopeful, Comptroller William Thompson Jr., also joined the meeting, and Senator Clinton reportedly spoke to the group via conference call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Sharpton again promised nonviolent demonstrations across the city this week, although Mayor Bloomberg yesterday downplayed suggestions that protests would &quot;shut down the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The city is doing fine,&quot; the mayor said, adding that he was &quot;proud&quot; of the peaceful reaction so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reverend also disputed the assessment of some civil rights experts who have suggested that federal charges are unlikely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are confident we can beat the odds here,&quot; Rev. Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
