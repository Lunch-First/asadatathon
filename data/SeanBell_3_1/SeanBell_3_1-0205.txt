ANGRY demonstrators protested and a federal review was promised after three New York City police detectives were acquitted of killing an unarmed black man who was shot at least 50 times on his wedding day.
A judge cleared two officers of manslaughter and a third of reckless endangerment in the death of 
 23.
Bell was shot, along with two friends, after a bachelor party at a strip club in November 2006.
Federal authorities said they would consider civil rights charges under a review by the Justice Department, federal prosecutors and the FBI.
They will ``take appropriate action if the evidence indicates a prosecutable violation'' of federal civil rights laws, the Justice Department said.
After the verdict, hundreds of demonstrators yelled, pushed and shoved as police, reporters and spectators packed the footpath outside the court building in Queens.
About 1000 people later marched to the site of the shooting, shouting ``Justice for 
 NYPD go to hell''.
