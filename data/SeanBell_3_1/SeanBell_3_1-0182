<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three US detectives were acquitted of all charges in the 50-shot killing of an unarmed groom-to-be on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman delivered the verdict in a New York courtroom packed with spectators including victim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fianc&eacute;e and parents, and at least 200 people gathered outside the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high-profile case put the New York Police Department at the centre of another dispute involving allegations of excessive firepower </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict provoked an outpouring of emotions. Bell's fianc&eacute;e immediately walked out of the room; his mother cried and gasps were heard throughout the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shouts of &quot;No!&quot; and &quot;Not guilty!&quot; erupted in the crowd outside the courthouse, and dozens of people began crying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, a 23-year-old black man, was killed in a hail of gunfire outside a strip club in Queens on November 25 2006 - his wedding day as he was leaving a stag party with two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers Michael Oliver, 36, and Gescard Isnora, 29, stood trial for manslaughter while Officer Marc Cooper, 40, was charged only with reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other officers were not charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver fired 31 shots; Isnora fired 11 rounds; and Cooper shot four times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers, complaining that pre-trial publicity had unfairly painted them as cold-blooded killers, opted to have the judge decide the case rather than a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge indicated that the police officers' version of events was more credible than the victims' version.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people have not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant was not justified&quot; in firing, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A conviction on manslaughter could have brought up to 25 years in prison; the penalty for reckless endangerment, is a year behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case brought back painful memories of other NYPD shootings, such as the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo - an African immigrant who was gunned down in a hail of 41 bullets by police officers who mistook his wallet for a gun. The acquittal of the officers in that case created a storm of protest and demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mood surrounding this case has been muted by comparison, although Mr Bell's fianc&eacute;e, parents and their supporters have held rallies demanding that the officers - two of whom are black - be held accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse, many in the crowd began weeping after hearing the verdict. Others were enraged, swearing and screaming &quot;Murderers! Murderers!&quot; or &quot;KKK!&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence had painted the victims as drunken thugs who the officers believed were armed and dangerous. Prosecutors sought to convince the judge that the victims had been minding their own business, and that the officers were inept, trigger-happy aggressors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the officers took the stand. Instead, Justice Cooperman heard transcripts of the officers testifying before a grand jury, saying they believed they had good reason to use force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge also heard testimony from Mr Bell's two companions - Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman - who insisted the incident erupted without warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Benefield and Mr Guzman were both wounded; Mr Guzman still has four bullets lodged in his body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victims and defendants were set on a fateful collision course by a pair of innocuous decisions: Mr Bell's to have a last-minute stag party at Kalua Cabaret, and the undercover detectives' to investigate reports of prostitution at the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the club closed around 4am, Sanchez and Isnora claimed they overheard Mr Bell and his friends first flirt with women, then taunt a stranger who responded by putting his right hand in his pocket as if he had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Guzman, they testified, said: &quot;Yo, go get my gun&quot; - something Mr Bell's friends denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora said he decided to arm himself, call for back-up and tail the trio as they went around the corner and got into Mr Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed that after warning the men to halt, Mr Bell pulled away and rammed an unmarked police van with Oliver at the wheel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detective also alleged that Mr Guzman made a sudden move as if he were reaching for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Benefield and Mr Guzman testified that there were no orders. Instead, Guzman said, Isnora &quot;appeared out of nowhere&quot; with a gun drawn and shot him in the shoulder - the first of 16 shots to enter his body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's all there was - gunfire,&quot; he said. &quot;There wasn't nothing else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
