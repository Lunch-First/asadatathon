After speaking to reporters in Manhattan about the protests he's organizing in response to the 
 verdict, Al Sharpton was asked about a separate issue: Barack Obama's denunciation of Jeremiah Wright.Sharpton, a politician and reverend, said, "What Barack Obama did was a profile in courage," and said it demonstrated the kind of leadership "I not only respect, but support."
This, a day after Sharpton blasted Obama for "grandstand[ing] in front of white people." Go figure.
