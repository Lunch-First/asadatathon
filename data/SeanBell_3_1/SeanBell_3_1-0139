<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY now, with all the talk of outrage over the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> verdict, you would think the jails would be filled with protesters, traffic would be tied up in every direction and the judge who acquitted the defendant shooters would at least be hanged in effigy.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the sun rose over a peaceful city yesterday, a day after deep disappointment for many, New York was no more on edge than it was when the Giants won the Super Bowl.       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community leaders promised peace - and delivered. But even that wasn't necessary to curtail an explosion. There was never any powder in the keg.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A riot, like the one that hit Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict, needs a little time to build. Tensions simply don't exist the way they did when Rudy Giuliani was mayor.       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was no surprise - not even to Bell's most ardent supporters - that Judge Arthur Cooperman would acquit the cops who killed Bell on Nov. 25, 2006, when they fired 50 shots at Bell's car.       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most cynics - that is, most of the black community - knew what the verdict would be before the first witness was called.       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had the expectations been higher, the outrage would have certainly been greater, although most of us are grateful that the city is not engulfed in flames.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we expected nothing, and got even less.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, an adviser to Bell's family and friends, vowed yesterday to &quot;shut the city down&quot; in protest, but he didn't say when.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's like striking while the iron is cooling off and being placed on a shelf in the closet.  </SPAN></P>
