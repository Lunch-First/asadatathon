Assemblyman Ruben Diaz, Jr. told me just now, "Once again it's a travesty of the judicial system where it seems like this verdict is going to have black and Latino communities feel like the system works for some but not for all."
"What do we do now? What do we do now? What now?" Diaz asked rhetorically.
Referring to the 1999 Amadou Diallo shooting, which took place in his Bronx district, Diaz added, "When there are 41 shots or 50 shots, the system continues to condone-through their verdicts-that this is an OK way to police black and Latino communities."
