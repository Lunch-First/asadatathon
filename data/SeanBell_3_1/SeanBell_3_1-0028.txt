THE FEDS pledged yesterday to look into charging the detectives who killed 
 with civil rights violations, but history strongly suggests they won't act.
A statement issued by the Justice Department and the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York said the feds "have been monitoring the state's prosecution." 
The feds promised to "take appropriate action if the evidence indicates a prosecutable violation of federal criminal civil rights statutes."
The feds rarely charge cops with civil rights violations - and almost never act in cases where the officers have been acquitted in state court.
"I think it's very unlikely" any new charges will be brought, said Anthony Ricco, the lawyer for cleared Detective Gescard Isnora.
Prosecuting cops under federal civil rights statutes can be hard because authorities must prove the officers intended to deprive a victim of his or her civil rights.
A Syracuse University report found that federal prosecutors declined to file charges against virtually all - 98.7% - cases of alleged civil rights violations by officials, but it happens.
In 1996, NYPD Officer Francis Livoti was acquitted in the Bronx of charges that he killed a man with a choke hold. Federal prosecutors then indicted him on civil rights charges. He was convicted in 1998 and served six years.
The feds have asked the NYPD to delay departmental proceedings until they decide whether to pursue the case against the three cops cleared of criminal charges yesterday. Once it gets the go-ahead, the NYPD will have 18 months to probe whether the cops violated department rules.
The cops are on modified duty, stripped of their guns. NYPD insiders say it's unlikely they'll ever patrol the streets again.
