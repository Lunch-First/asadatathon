The NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating a cruel prank call to the family of 
 fiance that originated from the Manhattan offices of a prominent police union, The Post has learned.   
"Ha, ha, ha," someone said in a 1:15 p.m. Friday phone call to the home of Nicole Bell's father Les Paultre, according to a police source.  
The number for the Sergeants Benevolent Association came up on the caller ID.  
"It was just horrible to get that phone call after coming back from the cemetery," said Nicole Bell.  
Her father said, "The guy was taunting us, laughing. It was horrible because we had just come back from the court and the cemetery."  
The president of the union, Edward Mullins, said, "If the accusations are true, we will deal with it."
