<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilman Leroy Comrie is taking a hard line against the police officers and officials involved in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters after a press conference in Jamaica, Comrie said the Police Department should &quot;remove the lieutenant, the commanding officer, the head of the division. They all need to be, I think, fired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, he added, &quot;We cannot look for the commissioner to do anything less than the full intent to show that he wants to have a professional Police Department with the best tactics and the best resources available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comrie's reaction is notable politically because his likely opponent in the Queens borough president race next year, Councilman Peter Vallone Jr., came to the defense of the Police Department today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement from Vallone, who is head of the City Council Public Safety Committee, said, &quot;Officers have a very difficult job, and in this instance something went terribly wrong. But the court has decided that these officers are not criminals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's Vallone's full statement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a tragedy for everyone. No verdict would bring back the life of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and heal the pain of his family.Officers have a very difficult job, and in this instance something went terribly wrong. But the court has decided that these officers are not criminals,&quot; Vallone said. &quot;We have already begun to learn from this tragedy and improve. My Public Safety Committee has already had three hearings-on undercover training, police monitoring, and community policing-and we have one on stop and frisk policy to come. The important thing now is to make sure something like this doesn't happen again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
