 family has been harassed with taunting phone calls and hate e-mails and will now be protected by security guards, the Rev. Al Sharpton said yesterday. 
Bell's pal Joseph Guzman, who testified about being shot by police the night Bell was killed, has also felt threatened - saying he's been followed by strange people.
"Tell me how we explain why we must get security for Mr. and Mrs. Bell's home because for some people, it's not enough to take their child," Sharpton said.
The revelation came as law enforcement sources confirmed that the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau was investigating taunting phone calls made to Bell's fiance, Nicole Paultre Bell, that may have originated from the offices of the Sergeants Benevolent Association.
Rachel Noerdlinger, a spokeswoman for Sharpton, said Paultre Bell has received "hate e-mail" and both she and Guzman have been tailed.
Noerdlinger said the e-mails have been given to cops.
NYPD brass declined to comment on the matter.
Meanwhile, the president of the sergeants group denied yesterday that his staff was the source of prank calls.
Edward Mullins said the taunting calls to Paultre Bell's family were made between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Friday when "there were not many people in the building."
"Those who were [in the building] are all mature professionals who wouldn't do something like that," Mullins said.
