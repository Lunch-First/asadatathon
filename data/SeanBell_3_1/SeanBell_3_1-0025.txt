NEW YORK - Anguish poured into the streets of New York on Saturday as hundreds of protesters expressed anger at Friday's acquittal of three police officers who gunned down a black man on the eve of his wedding.
Demonstrators took to the streets of Harlem, shouting "No justice, no peace," and holding up numbered signs, one for each of the 50 bullets fired at the unarmed man.
After weeks of hearing testimony, Justice Arthur Cooperman pronounced not-guilty verdicts against three police detectives who had opened fire in November 2006 on 
 23, as he left a nightclub in the borough of Queens after celebrating his stag night.
