<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FISTFIGHTS ERUPTED OUTSIDE the Queens courthouse after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> verdict was read yesterday - but the fury on the streets did not spread to the rest of the city. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops quickly contained the first firestorm after the three cops who killed Bell were acquitted, but many New Yorkers - especially African-Americans - were still seething.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Nicole and the parents had not asked us to be calm, we'd be burning the city now,&quot; said protester Lloyd Nelson, referring to Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre Bell, and the slain man's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is as calm as we are going to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could be my son tomorrow!&quot; chimed in a woman who identified herself as Cynthia, one of the dozens wearing Bell's face on hats, T-shirts and buttons. &quot;That judge is more guilty than the officers who shot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorrow and sadness were widespread across Bell's neighborhood in Jamaica - and was clearly visible in the red-rimmed eyes of Bell's pastor, Lester Williams, who had led a march to the courthouse steps before the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We accept the verdict, but this is not the end,&quot; Williams said. &quot;I have never seen an injustice like this before. Fifty shots and no one is being held responsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was killed on Nov. 25, 2006, on what would have been his wedding day. He was sitting in his car with two buddies around the corner from Kalua Cabaret, a strip joint where he had his bachelor party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 300 protesters chanting, &quot;No justice, no peace,&quot; marched last night from the courthouse to the spot where Bell was killed. The club shut its doors for the night &quot;out of respect for the community,&quot; a man inside said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York City needs to be outraged,&quot; said demonstrator Jesse Ehrensaft, 31, a social worker from Jackson Heights. &quot;People do not agree justice was served. Fifty shots is clearly murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the color line, many white New Yorkers expressed sympathy for the Bell family but many gave the detectives the benefit of the doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I'd been on the jury, I wouldn't have known what to believe,&quot; said Steffan Aletti, who lives in midtown. &quot;There was too much conflict and confusion in the witnesses testimony. . . . I think the acquittal was warranted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joan Boyle, who lives in Tudor City, said, &quot;We should respect the verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope there's not an effort to denigrate the system, even though you may disagree with the verdict,&quot; she said. &quot;I try to put myself in the place of those cops who are there night after night after night outside a well-known drug and strip joint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
