<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover detective who fired 31 of the 50 shots at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he was &quot;totally devastated&quot; when he learned two of his bullets had killed the Queens groom on his wedding day.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Michael Oliver told his lawyer, James Culleton, that he &quot;felt horrible&quot; about having been the one to fire the fatal shots on Nov. 25, 2006.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said, 'I just can't believe it,' &quot; Culleton said Oliver told him.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the trial, Queens prosecutors presented forensic evidence that showed one of the fatal shots entered Bell's right chest and another ripped through his liver.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver &quot;has to live with this for the rest of his life,&quot; the lawyer said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Culleton said Oliver told him &quot;he hadn't even seen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the car&quot; and was focused on Bell's friend Joseph Guzman, who was sitting in the front passenger seat. Guzman was shot and survived.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops thought Guzman was armed because Gescard Isnora, another plainclothes detective acquitted of manslaughter in the case last week, had heard Bell's friend say, &quot;Yo, go get my gun.&quot; The comment was overheard during a dispute outside a nearby strip club in Jamaica moments earlier.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see [Guzman] lifting his arms,&quot; Oliver told a grand jury last year. &quot;I didn't want to die. I reloaded the gun, and I continued to fire, and the shots still are going on around me.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Culleton said Oliver was &quot;extremely nervous&quot; throughout the two-month trial over the possibility of facing 25 years behind bars if convicted of manslaughter.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Culleton, 59, has had experience successfully defending everyone from police officers to mobsters.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He successfully represented Officer Richard Murphy, accused with three other cops of firing 41 shots in 1999 that killed African immigrant Amadou Diallo.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Culleton, who entered private practice in 1985 after a 12-year stint with the Bronx DA's Office, also defended Vincent &quot;Chin&quot; Gigante, the Mafia boss famous for wandering the streets in his pajamas as he feigned madness.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about his success at defending police officers, Culleton said, &quot;For the most part, cops accused of crimes really aren't criminals.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of Oliver, he said, &quot;Michael wants to move on with his life.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may be easier said than done.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton last night privately huddled with scores of local officials and community leaders at the Manhattan headquarters of the United Health Care Workers' Local 1199 - to which Bell's mom belongs - to plan protests that would include &quot;civil disobedience, boycotts and a major march on the Justice Department,&quot; Sharpton said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wouldn't give specifics, saying only that he and his supporters would make their move within the next 10 days.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We agreed we have many different tactics,&quot; he said, flanked by Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre-Bell, Guzman and another pal who was shot in the police fusillade, Trent Benefield.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers said teachers-union chief Randi Weingarten also was at the meeting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health-care-union President George Gresham vowed, &quot;We will be working . . . to make sure we educate people.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's dad, William, urged, &quot;No violence, but whatever it takes.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the detectives union, Michael Palladino, later issued a statement saying, &quot;The same legal system that grants people the right to lawful assembly has found our three detectives not guilty.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
