A Brooklyn designer said he created the stylish 

 black T-shirts worn by many of the tragic groom's supporters on the day of the verdict to make sure no one forgets the heartbreak of that day.  
Curtis Franklin, 26, said the shirt has been selling online to customers from as far away as Maryland. 
"As young black people, we feel the same pain," said Franklin. 
He said he never met Bell, but they had mutual friends. 
One of those friends asked Franklin to create a shirt honoring the late father of two, who died in a fusillade of bullets just hours before he was to be married. 
Franklin was happy to lend a creative hand, especially since the friend who approached him was supposed to have attended the fateful bachelor party in which Bell and two of his pals were shot. 
"It could have been any one of us in a situation like that anytime," said Rensford Montrose, who co-owns the design firm Eflat with Franklin. "We're black. It could've happened to us."  
The shirts, worn by many Bell supporters and shooting victim Trent Benefield at Friday's verdict, are for sale on their Web site, fashionhurtz.com for $25. 
On the back of the shirts, "

 R.I.P. 1983-2006" is written in script, above "50 SHOTS ISN'T JUSTICE."
