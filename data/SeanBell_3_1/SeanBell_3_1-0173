<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mother collapsed at the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre-Bell, rushed from the courtroom stricken with grief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father, William Bell was just plain angry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a slap in the face and a kick in the ass,&quot; he told WABC/Channel 7 outside Paultre-Bell's Far Rockaway, Queens, home. &quot;Here's a judge that says he didn't care about the law. All he care about is what he felt . . . To me, what's that supposed to mean, we're back in Alabama?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After learning at 9 a.m. that the three officers charged in the 2006 death of her son would go free, mom Valerie burst into tears in court. She and William left the courthouse a short time later and made their way though a wild crowd of protesters to a small motorcade waiting to take them away.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearby, fistfights broke out, as people held signs with slogans: &quot;50 Shots. 50 More Reasons We Need Revolution.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trent Benefield, a friend of Bell who was also shot outside club Kalua, yelled, &quot;Not guilty. Not guilty. It's real.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mass of protesters, cops and media was so thick that the Bells were forced to walk on the street. At one point, Valerie - wearing a pin with her son's face on it - fainted, and was caught by supporters. Bell's family made no statement after the verdict, but Nicole's mom, Laura Harper Paultre, later said she was disappointed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is upset. We were hoping for a guilty verdict but we're not surprised,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uncle of one of Bell's friends injured that night was outraged at the decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They got away with murder,&quot; said Joseph Guzman's uncle Elliot Hankerson, who was with them at the club on Nov. 25, 2006. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you empty your gun and reload it and start shooting again? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's mother and about two dozens family and friends - including the Rev. Al Sharpton - gathered at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> grave at Nassau Knolls Cemetery in Port Washington, LI, later in the morning. For 90 minutes, they prayed and mourned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paultre-Bell, who was to be wed to Bell on the day he was killed, was the last to leave, kneeling and saying her good-byes alone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group left behind a vase filled with flowers, including a rose, orchids and lilacs.     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the day, police were called to Paultre-Bell's after the family received prank phone calls.     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about the same time, the family learned they would get their wish for federal prosecutors to look into the case as a civil-rights violation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[We] will conduct an independent review of the facts and circumstances surrounding the Nov. 25, 2006, shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and two others,&quot; the Department of Justice said in a statement yesterday. </SPAN></P>
