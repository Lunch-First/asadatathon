<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baseball pitching great Roger Clemens may have more problems than whether or not he took steroids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Daily News is reporting that the former major leaguer had a 10-year affair with country singer Mindy McCready beginning when she was 15 and he was 28 (starting around 1990).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mindy, country's equivalent of Britney Spears, is trying to get her life and career right after some problems in both areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Roger confirmed through his lawyer that he and Mindy had a relationship but that it wasn't sexual, reports the NYDN. He considered her a family friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, the two reportedly met at a bar in Florida where Mindy was singing and Roger and some of his Red Sox teammates were hanging out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know we haven't heard the last of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of folks we haven't heard the last of, Britney's baaaack!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know it was only a matter of time before our favorite tarnished pop-star mom was back filming another episode of &quot;How I Met Your Mother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show got much hype and big ratings the first time around, so her return was a no-brainer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive producer and co-creator Craig Thomas said, &quot;We're all so thrilled to have Britney joining us once again. And just to head it off at the pass this time around: Yes, Mom, Britney's very nice, and no, I can't get her autograph for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Jennifer Aniston getting her groove back with John Mayer?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know we don't know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the two were seen enjoying each other's company in Miami last week. They dined together for lunch and dinner and seemed a little cozy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both have had their share of high-profile romances, so this might not be much of anything, but we are always cheering for our girl Jen. We'll just have to wait and see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also want to know: What's up with Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two have been hanging pretty tight lately, and Ms. Carey is sporting a huge rock on the ring finger of her left hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know Nick had a widely publicized engagement to Victoria Secret model Selena Eubanks, but the two never made it to the altar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, everybody's buzzing about Nick and Mariah, especially after seeing them hold hands at the party after the premiere of her new flick, &quot;Tennessee,&quot; reports People.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the mag asked Nick what he loved about Mariah, he said, &quot;Everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sounds like love to us!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither star's reps could be reached to answer questions about a possible engagement, so, as with Jen and John, we can't hurry love, we'll just have to wait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seems Heidi Montag and her boyfriend/manager/whatever Spencer Pratt did get somebody to ante up enough perks to get them to the Washington Correspondents Association Dinner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seems they were the guests of Fortune magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We happened to catch the red-carpet arrival of The Jonas Brothers on C-Span. You can bet Dick Cheney didn't get the kind of girl-squealing, flashbulb-popping response those dudes got.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congrats to &quot;Baby Mama&quot; star Amy Poehler and her hubby, Will Arnett. They are expecting their first child this fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lots of folks have been speaking out about the acquittal of three NYPD officers in the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but rappers have been putting their feelings in song.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Game has a tune called &quot;911 Is a Joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm outraged and speaking out for my generation that are afraid to speak out against police brutality and murder,&quot; said The Game. &quot;I grew up in Compton and had to stay silent because of the fear that was prevalent in my community, but now that I have a voice I'm speaking out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;911 Is a Joke&quot; features Black Wall Street artist Clyde Carson and is scheduled to debut today on thisizgame.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other artists rapping and speaking out include Cormega, Lee and Prodigy, who also has a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> song on his album called &quot;Field Marshal P.&quot;</SPAN></P>
