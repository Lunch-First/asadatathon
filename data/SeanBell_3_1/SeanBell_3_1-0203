<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANGRY chants of ''KKK'' and ``murderers'' rang out in New York yesterday as three detectives were acquitted of killing an unarmed black man in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict in the racially-charged </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case -- which raised questions about whether the New York police were trigger-happy -- placed the city on high alert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg appealed for calm saying ``we don't expect violence or law-breaking, nor is there any place for it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city remained calm with protests limited to minor but angry scuffles outside Queens County Court when the verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was delivered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, a 23-year-old father of two, died in a hail of 50 bullets outside the seedy Kalua Cabaret strip club in Jamaica, Queens on November 25, 2006 after leaving his bachelor party with friends. The three undercover detectives, who were at the club investigating reports of prostitution, claimed they believed one of the men was armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No gun was ever found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman found the officers not guilty, and suggested the prosecution witnesses had been unreliable. He found the shooting was careless but not reckless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``At times, the testimony of those witnesses just didn't make sense,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The people have not proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that each defendant was not justified in firing,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cries of ``shame on you'' filled the courthouse.</SPAN></P>
