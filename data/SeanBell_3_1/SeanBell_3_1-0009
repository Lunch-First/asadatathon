<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">SEAN BELL'S</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wounded buddy yesterday gave a powerful Michigan congressman a guided tour of a New York tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days after a trio of detectives were cleared of killing the young groom in a 50-bullet barrage, Joseph Guzman led Rep. John Conyers through the pouring rain from the Kalua Cabaret - the Queens strip club where Bell had held his bachelor party - to the spot where he died. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We walked down the corner here, we turned the corner,&quot; Guzman, who was shot 16 times and leaned heavily on his cane as he walked, told Conyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They stopped when they got to the spot on Liverpool St. in Jamaica where Bell was killed - and where dozens of bouquets and candles lay soaking in the rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With them were Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre Bell, his parents and Trent Benefield, the other survivor of the Nov. 25, 2006, shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to make sure justice is served, and we send a message not just to law enforcement but to young people that these types of tragedies have to end in this country,&quot; Conyers told them earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Conyers, a Democrat and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told them as they huddled under umbrellas was out of the earshot of reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Conyers turned to go, Ken Frydman, a spokesman for the Detectives' Endowment Association, approached him and said, &quot;I'd like to respectfully request a meeting with the chairman on behalf of the [association].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are who you say you are, I accept,&quot; replied Conyers, who had been asked by the Rev. Al Sharpton to visit the shooting scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton is trying to pressure federal prosecutors into trying the detectives for violating Bell's civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African-American community is still seething after Detectives Marc Cooper, Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora were acquitted Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper apologized for the shooting after the verdict; the other two haven't. All still face departmental hearings and civil suits and remain on modified duty, deprived of their guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, who fired 31 of the shots, is riding a desk at the Manhattan Detective Borough. Cooper is doing clerical work at Detective Borough Bronx, and Isnora is performing similar duties at Detective Borough Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three other members of the undercover unit that was conducting a prostitution sting at the Kalua Cabaret - and who were involved in the shooting but not charged with a crime - also remain on modified duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, a 23-year-old father of two, was killed on his wedding day. While legal experts said it's unlikely the feds would intervene, Sharpton and the Bell family aren't giving up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're the shot, not the shooters,&quot; Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other civil rights leaders have joined Sharpton's calls for peaceful demonstrations in the coming weeks to protest Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman's verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, former New York Civil Liberties Union head Norman Siegel and members of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, an advocacy group for black cops, proposed a permanent state special prosecutor with the power to investigate allegations of police brutality and corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said there was no need for a special prosecutor. Many in the African-American community believe prosecutors made a half-hearted attempt to convict the cops.</SPAN></P>
