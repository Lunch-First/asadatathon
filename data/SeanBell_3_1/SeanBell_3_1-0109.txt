NEW YORK -- The fiancee of an unarmed black man shot dead by police on his wedding day said the justice system ``let me down'' by acquitting the three detectives.
The slaying fuelled allegations of racism and excessive force by police, although two of the officers charged were black.
``They killed Sean all over again,'' Nicole Paultre Bell said. ``That's what it felt like to us.
``I'm still praying for justice, because it's not over.''
Relatives of the victims have sued the city, and the officers also face possible departmental charges.
Ms Bell stormed out of court after the NYPD detectives were cleared of charges over 23-year-old 
 killing in a hail of 50 gunshots outside a Queens strip club in 2006.
Later, more than 300 people marched through Harlem; 50 carried white placards bearing numbers for the shots fired at Mr Bell and his friends.
The Rev Al Sharpton lambasted the judge who acquitted the detectives, saying a jury should have decided. He's threatened to ``shut the city down''.
Justice Arthur Cooperman said inconsistent evidence, the demeanour and rap sheets of the prosecution witnesses -- mainly Mr Bell's friends -- ``had the effect of eviscerating'' their credibility. None of the officers took the stand.
Detective Michael Oliver, who fired 31 shots, wept as did Mr Bell's mother.
Shouts of ``Murderers! Murderers!'' and ``KKK!'' rang out outside court.
Mr Bell was killed as he left his bachelor party. The undercover cops said they thought one man had a gun; no gun was found.
