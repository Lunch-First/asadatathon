<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three US detectives have been acquitted of all counts in the 50-shot killing of an unarmed man on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper from the New York City Police Department were charged with manslaughter, reckless endangerment and assault in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman delivered the verdict in a Queens courtroom packed with spectators, including the victim's fiancee and parents. The ruling ended a two-month trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell was killed outside a strip club in Queens on November 25 2006 - his wedding day - as he was leaving his stag party with two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora and Oliver faced the most serious charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shouts of &quot;No!&quot; and &quot;Not guilty!&quot; erupted outside the courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers, complaining pre-trial publicity unfairly painted them as cold-blooded killers, opted to have the judge decide the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers Oliver, 36, and Isnora, 29, stood trial for manslaughter while Officer Cooper, 40, was charged with reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other shooters weren't charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver squeezed off 31 shots; Isnora fired 11; and Cooper shot four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case brought back painful memories of other NYPD shootings, such as the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo - an African immigrant who was gunned down in a hail of 41 bullets by police officers who mistook his wallet for a gun. The acquittal of the officers in that case created a storm of protest, with hundreds arrested after taking to the streets in demonstration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mood surrounding this case has been muted by comparison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Bell's fiancee, parents and their supporters, including the Reverend Al Sharpton, have held rallies demanding that the officers - two of whom are black - be held accountable.</SPAN></P>
