<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THREE New York City detectives were found not guilty yesterday in the shooting death of an unarmed black man killed in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day, prompting angry reactions and a federal review of the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New York state judge cleared two police officers of manslaughter and other charges and a third of reckless endangerment in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23. Bell was shot, along with two friends, after a bachelor party at a strip club in November 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But federal authorities said they would consider civil rights charges in a review of the case to be conducted by the Justice Department, federal prosecutors and the FBI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will &quot;take appropriate action if the evidence indicates a prosecutable violation of federal criminal civil rights statutes&quot;, the Justice Department said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, hundreds of demonstrators, some carrying placards reading &quot;Jail Racist Killer Cops&quot;, marched on the courthouse. There was pushing and shoving in the crowd as police, reporters and spectators packed the footpath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader Al Sharpton, who has been highly critical of police and is influential in New York's black community, called for wider protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They want us to act crazy so they would have an excuse to do more,&quot; Mr Sharpton told listeners of his radio show. &quot;[But] we are going to close the city down in a non-violent, effective way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael Bloomberg called for calm after the verdict, saying: &quot;We don't expect violence or law-breaking, nor is there any place for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has outraged New York's black community, but police said they did not expect violence because previous demonstrations against the perceived police brutality had been peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shows that there is no justice in America for the black man. This is telling us the cops can do whatever they want and get away with it,&quot; said B.M. Marcus, a community organiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers gave brief statements thanking their friends and family. &quot;I'd like to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,&quot; said Detective Marc Cooper, who had been charged with reckless endangerment. The other detectives, Gescard Isnora and Michael Oliver, had been charged with manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants chose to have the judge, rather than a jury, decide their guilt or innocence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyers said jurors in the borough of Queens were likely to be biased against the detectives due to intense media coverage of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Supreme Court Judge Arthur Cooperman said the charges could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge gave credibility to the detectives' statements that they believed they were in danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of the shooting, Detective Isnora, the undercover officer who fired first, followed Bell and his two friends to Bell's car believing they went to fetch a gun to settle a dispute at the club. He opened fire after being grazed by Bell's car as Bell tried to drive away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other officers said they believed Detective Isnora was being fired at from inside the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
