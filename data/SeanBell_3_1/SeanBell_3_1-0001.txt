A GROUP of demonstrators carrying placards numbering each time 
 was shot by the three acquitted NYPD detectives blocked a portion of Seventh Ave. and 34th St. last night before moving in front of Madison Square Garden.
The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been calling for displays of civil disobedience after last Friday's verdict, was not at the demonstration and said he did not organize it. Bell's parents - William and Valerie - also did not attend.
