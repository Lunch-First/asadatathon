<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicole Paultre-Bell choked back tears yesterday as she blasted a judge's decision to clear three NYPD detectives in the slaying of her fianc&eacute; -  saying it was like &quot;they killed Sean all over again.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The justice system let me down,&quot; she said, speaking for the first time since Detectives Michael Oliver, Marc Cooper and Gescard Isnora were cleared of all criminal charges in the Nov. 25, 2006, shooting that left </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, dead on his wedding day.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paultre-Bell received a standing ovation from hundreds attending a standing-room-only rally at the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network headquarters in Harlem.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On April 25, 2008, they killed Sean all over again,&quot; she said. &quot;That's what it felt like to us.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paultre-Bell, the mother of Bell's two young children, was &quot;devastated&quot; by the decision, said her father, Les Paultre, and barely slept Friday night.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm still praying for justice, because it's not over,&quot; she said. &quot;Every protest, every march, every rally. I'll be right up front.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the rally, about 150 Bell supporters flooded the streets and marched 20 blocks through Harlem, chanting, &quot;No justice, no peace,&quot; stopping briefly outside the 32nd Precinct station house.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no arrests, and another march is planned for today.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the National Action Network rally, Sharpton urged people to protest Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman's verdict in nonviolent ways, and announced he was meeting with labor and civil-rights leaders Tuesday at 1199 SEIU headquarters on West 43rd Street to discuss a day of civil disobedience to take place in the next two weeks.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strategically know how to stop the city so people stand still and realize that you do not have the right to shoot down unarmed, innocent citizens with no probable cause,&quot; he said to chants of &quot;Shut it down.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton, who had tears in his eyes at times, demanded a law requiring officers to get tested for alcohol after any shooting and a special prosecutor to deal with police cases.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said also said he and the Bell family plan to meet with congressional judiciary committees tomorrow in Washington to discuss possible action.      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the exonerated detectives kept low profiles yesterday, mostly staying behind closed doors and drawn curtains.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper -  clad in jeans, sunglasses and a white, striped polo shirt -  came out of his upstate home to cut his grass.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to mow my lawn at least,&quot; he said. &quot;I haven't had any privacy.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A friend who visited the cop told reporters, &quot;He's doing wonderful.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman, meanwhile, stayed mum inside his home in Kew Gardens, Queens, which was watched by cops in two unmarked cars.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional reporting by John Doyle and Matthew Nestel    </SPAN></P>
