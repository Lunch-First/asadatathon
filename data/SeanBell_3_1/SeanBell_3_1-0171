<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FROM Day 1, I was on my own.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I alone in the media saw the case against the cops who shot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as an absolute stinker - a trial that pitted three men who tried to protect innocent lives against every stripper, crackhead and thug in the borough of Queens.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it turns out, I was right. And I wanted to feel good about the verdict.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then, I spoke to Detective Marc Cooper. And the heart of this cop was with the family of the man he killed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're hurting,&quot; he told me, his voice gentle as tears. &quot;Everybody is different. We are not robots.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These last two months, Cooper was painted as the sympathetic figure standing trial in the fatal police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> one dank and desperate night at the Queens club Kalua.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet he defended his colleague, Detective Michael Oliver, who has been tarred, featured, tried and convicted in the press of extreme arrogance. Of being a &quot;robot.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the second this loser of a trial was over, and Justice Arthur Cooperman made it clear to everyone - save perhaps Al Sharpton and Michael Bloomberg - that no crime was committed in the tragic death of Bell, Oliver did something remarkable.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The iceman melteth. He cried. Openly and uncontrollably, for all to see.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's over.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the acquittal, the first words out of Cooper's mouth were for the Bell family.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,&quot; he said, choking up.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With yesterday's decision, perhaps this city may start to heal. Detectives Cooper, Oliver and Gescard Isnora are not going to jail. Why they went on trial in the first place is a mystery steeped in politics and ill will from which this city has to recover.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Cooper, it's not finished. Not for any of these men.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper, acquitted of reckless endangerment, is the only man who stood trial in Bell's death who is a husband and father. Cooper understands dread in ways others can only imagine.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm hoping to get my family back,&quot; he told me.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These last two months have been stressful on Cooper's wife and children, ages 13 and 5.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked Cooper if he was going to celebrate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going home to sleep,&quot; he said. &quot;I've been sleeping two hours a night for months.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, Oliver regained his composure. But first he thanked me for seeing this case for what it was.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My family appreciates your articles,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank me? You put your life on the line and nearly lost everything, because you did your job. I thank you.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's death, sadly, was caused by a potent mixture of booze and bravado. It represents a dark period in this city that began when Mayor Bloomberg declared Bell's shooting &quot;excessive&quot; and &quot;unacceptable&quot; - before any investigation was done.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But prosecutor Charles Testagrossa put on a half-assed show trial, in which his own witnesses continually tripped themselves up and made it clear they were looking for big civil judgments from the city.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This city will recover. It always does. But I fear one thing:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor - how many will fear to join the police force now? </SPAN></P>
