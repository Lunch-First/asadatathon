THE WOMAN who would have been 

 mother-in-law prayed yesterday that the three cops who gunned him down in a 50-bullet barrage are convicted. 
Laura Harper Paultre said she also prayed there will be peace in Queens "no matter what."
"No matter what the verdict is, it won't bring Sean back," she said. "I just prayed for justice. But no matter what it is, Sean is dead. Guilty or not guilty, Sean is dead."
Harper Paultre spoke at the Community Church of Christ in Jamaica, Queens, where about a dozen Bell supporters gathered for a 24-hour prayer vigil.
Bell's mother, Valerie, stopped by a few hours later after work. "It's in God's hands right now," she said.
Bell's fiance, Nicole, and the Rev. Al Sharpton spoke later in the evening.
"We have no hate. We have no malice. We seek no revenge," Sharpton said. "We put it in God's hands."
This morning, Bell supporters will march from the church to Queens Supreme Court, where Justice Arthur Cooperman will read his verdict shortly after 9 a.m.
"Miraculously, I don't feel any anxiety," Harper Paultre said. "I'm very optimistic about tomorrow. I have faith in Judge Cooperman and in God."
Bell, 23, was killed on his wedding day, Nov. 25, 2006, around the corner from a Queens topless club where he'd just had his bachelor party. Two of Bell's buddies who were in his car, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, were badly wounded.
Shortly afterward, Bell's fiance legally took his last name. She is the mother of Bell's two daughters.
"I feel like a person who has been sentenced to die in an electric chair, and this is my last day on Earth," said Bishop Lester Williams, who was supposed to preside at the wedding and was at the vigil.
"This has been a burden on the community," Williams said. "Today is the eve of the unknown. . . . Our prayers here are that the citizens will respect the decision of the judge."
