A judge will announce his verdict today in the trial of three police officers charged in the shooting death of 
 23, outside a Queens, strip club. 
Detectives Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper have been on trial since Feb. 25 for the shooting on Nov. 25, 2006. Two of Bell's friends, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, were wounded and testified against the officers. Bell and his group had just left his bachelor party at the Club Kalua when the fatal 50-shot encounter with the police happened.
Isnora and Oliver are charged with manslaughter and Cooper with reckless endangerment.
As part of police precautions, scores of officers will be posted outside the Queens courthouse where the three detectives will learn their fate.
Other officers will be assigned to Club Kalua and the Baisley Park Houses, the Queens housing project that was the scene of tensions after the shooting.
Rev. Al Sharpton, who has advocated on behalf of the victims, denounced the preparations, calling suggestions that rioting may result from an acquittal insulting.
"We never participated in or engaged in violence," Sharpton said. "Maybe you ought to ask people who believe it's all right to shoot 50 times at unarmed men how they are going to react."
