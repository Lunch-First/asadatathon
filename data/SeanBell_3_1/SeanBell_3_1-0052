<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ballistics evidence:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of deformed bullets, bullet shards and shell casings - including the deadly lead pieces removed from Bell's body and the projectiles that injured his friends. Prosecutors also showed pictures and video of the AirTrain station, where passengers scattered at the moment Detective Marc Cooper's bullet flew through the glass. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injuries:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors included a closeup snapshot of Detective Gescard Isnora's skinned shin, where he said Bell drove into his leg, which the defense used to claim that he had reason to fear for his life. Prosecutors used illustrations, X-rays and MRIs to describe the damage from Guzman's wounds, which ran from his neck to his ankle. Medical experts testified about Guzman's injuries, including intestinal damage and nerve damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Car:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of photos depicted the massive damage to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> car, which included shattered glass inside and out, deep gashes in the metal and the seats, and blood-spattered interior. In one, multicolored crime scene rods marked the damage to the passenger side of 1999 Nissan Altima, where cops said they were aiming. There were also photos of the undercover officers' van, damaged from the two collisions with Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statements:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the cops never took the stand, their testimony from the grand jury - in which they described their decision to open fire after fearing for their lives - were introduced by the prosecution, and will be a key factor in the judge's decision. Defense lawyers tried to erode the credibility of survivors Benefield's and Guzman's in-court testimony.</SPAN></P>
