<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CIVIL rights leaders demanded a federal investigation and vowed to march through the streets in protest after three police officers were cleared of all charges in the killing of an unarmed black man cut down in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict by Justice Arthur Cooperman elicited gasps as well as tears of joy and sorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Michael Oliver, who fired 31 of the shots, wept at the defence table, while the mother of victim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cried in the packed courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shouts of ``Murderers! Murderers!'' and ``KKK!'' -- a reference to the Ku Klux Klan -- rang out on the courthouse steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, was killed outside a seedy strip club in the New York suburb of Queens in 2006 as he was leaving his bachelor party with two friends. The officers -- undercover detectives who were investigating reports of prostitution at the club -- said they thought one of the men had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slaying heightened tensions in the city and stoked long-standing allegations of racism and excessive use of force on the part of New York City's police, even though two of the officers charged are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing his verdict in the non-jury trial, the judge said the inconsistent testimony, courtroom demeanour and rap sheets of the prosecution witnesses -- mainly Bell's friends -- ``had the effect of eviscerating'' their credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``At times, the testimony just didn't make sense,'' the judge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police had assigned extra officers to the courthouse and had helicopters in the air to help deal with any unrest. But within an hour, the angry, weeping crowd of about 200 people outside the courthouse had scattered, and despite a few scuffles, no arrests were made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver and Gescard Isnora were acquitted of charges that included manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment. The third officer, Marc Cooper, faced lesser charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict does not entirely resolve issues surrounding the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US attorney's office said it would look into the case and ``take appropriate action if the evidence indicates a prosecutable violation of federal criminal civil rights statutes''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, relatives of the victims have sued the city, and those cases could either go to trial or be settled out of court with the potential for multimillion-dollar payouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the officers still face possible departmental charges that could result in their firing.</SPAN></P>
