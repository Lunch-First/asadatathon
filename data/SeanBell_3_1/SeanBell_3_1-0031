<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NIGHTMARE that began on Nicole Paultre Bell's wedding day spawned more heartache yesterday as she fled court in tears, knelt at her fianc&eacute;'s grave and returned home to taunting phone calls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clad in black, the young mother of two did not put her emotions into words, but her family said she was crushed that no one would pay for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody would be devastated,&quot; her father, Les Paultre, said outside his Far Rockaway home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paultre Bell, 23, began the day with a tearful prayer with the Rev. Al Sharpton at a diner near the courthouse in Kew Gardens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They walked into the courtroom together, but when Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman announced the not guilty verdict, she broke away and ran out in tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was soon followed by Trent Benefield, who was with Bell at the Kalua Cabaret and was wounded in the hail of gunfire that killed his buddy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tears streamed down Benefield's face as he spoke with disgust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They did a crime, they should pay the price. It's unfair,&quot; he said. &quot;If I did it, I'd be doing 25 to life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield, 24, said he planned to &quot;keep fighting&quot; for justice for his friend and said he was sure the acquitted cops would face a day of reckoning at some point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the end, they have to deal with God, like all of us,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavy security enveloped Bell's parents, Valerie and William, as they left the courthouse with their slain son's fianc&eacute;e.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They headed for the Nassau Knolls Cemetery &amp; Memorial Park in Port Washington, L.I., where Bell's grave is marked with a simple granite slab bearing the epitaph &quot;See you later.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weeping, Nicole knelt on the ground and placed flowers next to the marker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterward, she returned to her parents' home, where police were called to investigate a series of callous, crank calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicole's father said when they answered the phone, they heard laughing or the line went dead. The number on the caller ID came back to the Sergeants Benevolent Association, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SBA President Edward Mullins said the NYPD was investigating the phone calls. &quot;We'll cooperate with any investigation. If . . . it came from here, I want to know,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Les Paultre said he was stunned by the verdict. He called it &quot;ridiculous,&quot; but said the family was not discouraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not going to give up,&quot; he said. &quot;We're going to keep pushing forward because Sean did not die in vain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's parents echoed that message. After returning from the cemetery, they locked arms with 10 supporters, some in T-shirts with Bell's picture on the front and the slogan &quot;Never Again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today I felt like I was reliving the death of my son all over again,&quot; Valerie Bell said. &quot;We are going to fight this to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though their anger was palpable, the Bells were calm and urged supporters to follow suit. The message was mostly heeded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse, family friend Lloyd Nelson yelled: &quot;This is as calm as we are going to be! If Nicole and the parents had not asked us to be calm, we'd be burning the city now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
