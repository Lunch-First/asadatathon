<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ERIC Munkman's legs gave out on him three years ago, but seated in a wheelchair for Sydney's Anzac Day parade brought him eye-to-eye with its youngest participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the 89-year-old World War II veteran says he likes what he sees: A generation of Australians shining with pride in their nation's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">servicemen and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday an estimated 230,000 spectators cheered as more than 21,000 marchers from home and abroad took to the streets of Sydney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd was up by about 40,000 on last year and the number of marchers by 1000 -- and their spirits were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">higher than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``It's very emotional. The blokes really appreciate the people standing on the sidelines and cheering them on,'' Mr Munkman's daughter Beryl Dodds said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She pushed her father's wheelchair for the first time yesterday and admitted to a few tears during the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I had a little cry ... everyone came together as one to support those who served their country,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Mr Munkman said he had ``quite enjoyed'' the occasion, which saw him high-fiving the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the family and friends of the 645 sailors who perished on HMAS Sydney in 1941, yesterday's march was particularly emotional, coming just a month after the wreck was finally located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I was only nine years old when my Uncle Leonard was killed in action,'' 76-year-old Grace Russell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I remember I came home from school and my father was crying in the bedroom. He'd just received a telegram from the War Department.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> whose grandfather David Shepherd died when the ship was sunk, made the journey from Perth to represent his family: ``None of us fought for our country but we know how to honour those who did,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar sentiments were voiced at the dawn service at Martin Place hours earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A record attendance, estimated at 35,000, became a rainbow vista of umbrellas, hats and anything from bin liners to plastic coats worn to deflect the rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Land Commander of Australia Maj-Gen Mark Kelly told the crowd that the word ``Anzac'' referred to more than a military campaign: ``It has transcended the physical meaning to become a spirit, an inspiration which embodies courage, discipline, sacrifice, self-reliance and, in Australian terms, mateship and a fair go,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the state, Dawn Services were held in numerous regional centres, including Newcastle, Bathurst, Lithgow and Albury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Gosford, 88-year-old former bomber pilot John Leeuwin-Clark said it was gratifying so many had braved the weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We all have stories and this is a nice time of year to think back on your old friends,'' said Mr Leeuwin-Clark, who served in East Africa and the Middle East in World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Sadly a lot of the boys didn't come home. It's important to remember them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One woman doing just that was Legacy widow Gwen Miller from Liverpool, who attended the Sydney parade alone for the first time since her husband Gordon's death last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She felt he was nonetheless there in spirit: ``He's with me today -- he's always with me. I've got his medals on and I'm wearing his picture in a locket around my neck,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By mid-morning, Narrabeen resident Lisa Smith, 21, had barely any voice left -- the result of cheering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I went to the Dawn</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Service so I've been up since 3.45am,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
