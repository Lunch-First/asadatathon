I just got back from Michael Bloomberg's press conference at a job center in Jamaica, not far from where 
 was killed in 2006.
Bloomberg said he doesn't expect any violence in response to today's verdict, and added that there is room for peaceful dissent and possibly legal action.
Also there were Queens Borough President Helen Marshall, Council Speaker Christine Quinn, Council members Leroy Comrie and Tom White, and State Senate Democratic leader Malcolm Smith.
Quinn said the city now has to "peacefully move on" and "do more work" to make sure this never happens again.
