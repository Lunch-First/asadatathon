Justice Arthur Cooperman delivered a fair verdict in the 
 shooting case, setting aside both emotion and victims' conflicting accounts, top criminal lawyers said yesterday.   
"Based on the facts, this case was going to be extremely difficult to develop from a prosecutor's perspective, with proof beyond a reasonable doubt, given the chaos that preceded the moments when the shots were fired," defense lawyer Benjamin Brafman said.  
"This case was just headed for disaster when the facts began to crystallize."  
Many said the key witnesses' criminal pasts and inconsistent stories only added to the difficulty in proving that the officers fired without justification.  
"Based upon what I understand of the testimony, it was easy for a judge to say there was reasonable doubt," said Ronald Aiello, a former Brooklyn judge now in private practice. "A jury would never have decided this case. You would have had a hung jury."  
Kenneth Montgomery, a former Brooklyn prosecutor who is now a defense lawyer, said, "The judge seemed to have been the perfect juror."  
"That judge did what was right, based on the evidence."
