<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's &quot;D-Day.&quot; That means decision time for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trial, in which three NYPD detectives are accused of killing the groom-to-be and injuring his two friends in a hail of bullets outside a Queens strip club last November.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell supporters yesterday said they expected the community to react peacefully no matter the verdict today - but the NYPD, state court officials and the club at the center of it all prepared for the worst. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow is like D-Day - decision day,&quot; Bishop Lester Williams, spiritual adviser to Bell's mother, Valerie, said yesterday. &quot;I pray for calm. I pray for the Police Department and the city of New York.&quot; Meanwhile, the Kalua club, where Bell, 23, was celebrating his bachelor party, planned to shut down today in the event of an unfavorable verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The boss is worried that people will bum rush the place if the cops get off and tear it apart,&quot; a bouncer told The Post. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora face up to 25 years in prison for manslaughter. Detective Marc Cooper is charged with reckless endangerment and could avoid jail time altogether. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Court officials said other cases would be postponed until after Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman renders his verdict and all the parties are out of the building. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD is also buckling down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One source said cops were &quot;hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst&quot; as they pulled in resources from around the city to focus on the area around the courthouse and the Jamaica site where Bell, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman were shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's fianc&eacute;e and the mother of his two daughters, Nicole Paultre-Bell, had her hair done yesterday at Impulse Salon on Jamaica Avenue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her exact words were she's 'very sad,' &quot; said her stylist, Ayanna Dossantos, 28. &quot;She just wants justice. She's not the same, happy person she used to be. She's here, but she's not here.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bell family, meanwhile, held a 24-hour vigil at the Community Church of Christ, in Jamaica, where Bell would have been married, but was instead eulogized.  Additional reporting by Kavita Mokha and Larry Celona    </SPAN></P>
