It's been a rough year for prosecutor Charles Testagrossa.  
On Friday, the Queens counselor lost the 
 case. In February, his 26-year-old son, Robert, was locked up for five years in one of the city's most bizarre cases in recent memory.  
Along with two pals, the young man ambushed his girlfriend's former lover and, using a homemade branding iron, burned a letter "R" into his skin.  
Robert Testagrossa pleaded guilty to assault.  
The elder Testagrossa said the Bell trial was "possibly the most difficult case I've ever had to try."
