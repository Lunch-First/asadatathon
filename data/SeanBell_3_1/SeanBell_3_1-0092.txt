The first time House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers came to New York to hector cops, it was 1984.  
He returned Monday, after the acquittal of three city detectives in the 
 case, to again cast a gimlet eye on the men and women in blue.   
The intervening 24 years saw the Diallo and Bell cases, among others where New Yorkers died in arguably preventable confrontations with the police.  
Also over that time, exactly 100 members of the New York City Police Department were murdered in the line of duty.  
That's a powerful number.  
We cite it not to excuse whatever errors of training or judgment occurred in the Bell tragedy - again, a judge disposed of the criminal charges - but to add context to the continuing debate.  
Conyers' 1984 visit was part of a 17-month inquiry into what the then-chairman of the House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice termed racism and police brutality here and in other big cities.  
Nothing much came of that probe, and no surprise there - then (as now) Conyers' concerns had a certain rhetorical resonance, but not much substance.  
One hundred murdered police officers, on the other hand, is a very substantial number indeed.
