<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">SEAN BELL'S</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family has been harassed with taunting phone calls and hate e-mails and will now be protected by security guards, the Rev. Al Sharpton said yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's pal Joseph Guzman, who testified about being shot by police the night Bell was killed, has also felt threatened - saying he's been followed by strange people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tell me how we explain why we must get security for Mr. and Mrs. Bell's home because for some people, it's not enough to take their child,&quot; Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelation came as law enforcement sources confirmed that the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau was investigating taunting phone calls made to Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre Bell, that may have originated from the offices of the Sergeants Benevolent Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rachel Noerdlinger, a spokeswoman for Sharpton, said Paultre Bell has received &quot;hate e-mail&quot; and both she and Guzman have been tailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noerdlinger said the e-mails have been given to cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD brass declined to comment on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the president of the sergeants group denied yesterday that his staff was the source of prank calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward Mullins said the taunting calls to Paultre Bell's family were made between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Friday when &quot;there were not many people in the building.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who were [in the building] are all mature professionals who wouldn't do something like that,&quot; Mullins said.</SPAN></P>
