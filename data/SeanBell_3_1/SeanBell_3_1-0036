<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">blew out everything yesterday morning for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> verdict, then almost audibly held their breath while waiting to see if the blanket acquittals would trigger an explosive aftermath. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their sigh of relief at the largely orderly response among Bell supporters stood in sharp contrast to the tone at black radio stations, where many hosts and callers immediately expressed frustration and fury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't go tearing your neighborhood up,&quot; said Ed Lover, morning host on WWPR (105.1 FM). &quot;But I'm so mad I don't know what to do. This is a travesty of justice. It's like black life in New York don't matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These families wanted some justice,&quot; said Bob Slade, news director of WRKS (98.7 FM). &quot;They didn't get any.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WBLS (107.5 FM) morning host Steve Harvey said, &quot;We're sick and tired. This country needs to be repaired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a caller to WQHT (97.1 FM) talked about &quot;channeling our anger to something positive,&quot; morning host Miss Jones said, &quot;Maybe this isn't the time to suppress our anger,&quot; though she added that she wasn't advocating violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With neither the acquitted officers nor the families of victims making public statements (even the Rev. Al Sharpton held off), television's coverage after the verdict felt muted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the local stations sent reporters to the scene, but often stayed with crowd shots from helicopters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters assessed the verdict with analysts, who generally agreed that the prosecution was not able to make a case that was convincing enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hosts on talk-radio WABC (770 AM) were more sympathetic toward the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his homeboys were doing, they didn't deserve to die,&quot; said WABC's Curtis Sliwa. &quot;But anyone who thinks a police officer goes into any situation looking to pull his gun and shoot somebody is insane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
