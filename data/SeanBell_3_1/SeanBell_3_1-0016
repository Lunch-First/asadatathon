<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFTER BEING indicted for manslaughter, Detective Michael Oliver infamously dined at celebrity restaurant Nello's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his acquittal, the 31-shot cop quietly prayed in an orthodox Christian church. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver traveled Friday from a Queens courtroom to a Holy Week religious service in Little Falls, N.J., where he was welcomed by fellow parishioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were all praying for Mike,&quot; a parishioner said yesterday at the St. George Antiochian Orthodox Christian Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, 36, is a regular at the parish just off Route 46 in suburban Passaic County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday evening, the 13-year police veteran participated in the parish's Holy Week service; the Orthodox church marks Easter one week after Passover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver and two fellow detectives were acquitted hours earlier of charges in the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One day after his March 2007 indictment, Oliver infuriated Bell's parents - and some of his own supporters - by enjoying a $4,200 dinner at Nello's. The tab included $180 pasta with truffles and $575 bottles of wine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the New Jersey church yesterday, Father Elias Bitar said the trial was hard on Oliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the night of the Bell shooting, Oliver - who is credited with making more than 600 arrests on the job - had never fired his weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's difficult for everyone involved when there's a loss of life,&quot; Bitar said yesterday. &quot;There's a sadness. You pray for everyone involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You pray everyone gets a fair shake.&quot; lmcshane@nydailynews.com</SPAN></P>
