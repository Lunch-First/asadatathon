<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - Hundreds of angry people marched through Harlem on Saturday after the Rev. Al Sharpton promised to &quot;close this city down&quot; to protest the acquittals of three police detectives in the 50-shot barrage that killed a groom on his wedding day and wounded two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strategically know how to stop the city so people stand still and realize that you do not have the right to shoot down unarmed, innocent civilians,&quot; Sharpton told an overflow crowd of several hundred people at his National Action Network office in the historically black Manhattan neighborhood. &quot;This city is going to deal with the blood of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton was joined by the family of 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - a black man - and a friend of Bell who was wounded in the 2006 shooting outside a Queens strip club. Two of the three officers charged were also black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally at Sharpton's office was followed by a 20-block march down Malcolm X Boulevard and then across 125th Street, Harlem's main business thoroughfare, where some bystanders yelled out, &quot;Kill the police!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty of the marchers carried white placards bearing big black numbers for each of the police bullets fired at Bell and his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton urged people to return for a meeting this coming week &quot;to plan the day that we will close this city down&quot; with the kind of &quot;massive civil disobedience&quot; once led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They never accused </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of doing anything. Then why is he dead?&quot; Sharpton asked, his voice roaring with anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities &quot;have shown now that they will not hold police accountable. Well, guess what? If you won't, we will!&quot; Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton vows to 'close this city' after officer acquittals</SPAN></P>
