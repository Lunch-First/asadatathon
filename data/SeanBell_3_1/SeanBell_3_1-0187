<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 74-year-old judge known for his no-nonsense approach will deliver one of the most important bench-trial verdicts in the city's history today.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman, slated to render his decision in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trial, once threatened to eject a rape victim from his courtroom for crying too loudly.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he must decide the fate of three detectives accused in the slaying of Bell, who was shot in a hail of 50 bullets on Nov. 25, 2006, in Jamaica.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora face up to 25 years in the slammer for manslaughter. Marc Cooper is charged with reckless endangerment and faces up to a year.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman is no stranger to cop trials.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1986, he presided over the trial of NYPD Sgt. Richard Pike and Officer Jeffrey Gilbert, convicted of torturing two teens with stun guns.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied a request to throw out the jury's verdict, calling it an &quot;affront&quot; to &quot;honest and honorable police officers.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever today's verdict, Bell supporters have promised peace.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let us be the purveyors of peace so the oppressors will not rob of us our most vital resource, our young people,&quot; Father Darryl James said last night at Community Church of Christ, where the groom-to-be's funeral had been held.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Kalua strip club, where Bell, 23, had been celebrating his bachelor party, planned to shut down today if the cops go free. &quot;The boss is worried that people will bum rush the place,&quot; a bouncer told The Post.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Court officials said other cases would be postponed until after the verdict.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre-Bell, had her hair done yesterday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She just wants justice,&quot; said her stylist, Ayanna Dossantos, 28, &quot;She's not the same, happy person she used to be.&quot; </SPAN></P>
