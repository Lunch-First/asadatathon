<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in 1999, then-state Sen. David Paterson was arrested on disorderly conduct charges during a series of demonstrations against the cop-shooting death of unarmed African immigrant Amadou Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, almost a decade later - no longer a rabble-rousing member of the Senate minority, but rather New York's first black governor - his views on civil disobedience have changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paterson told the Daily News yesterday that he would not approve if the Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized the Diallo days of rage, follows through on his vow to &quot;close this city down&quot; with mass demonstrations in response to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I certainly would not be in favor of that,&quot; Paterson said of any shutdown - even if the protests are peaceful, as vowed. &quot;People are trying to go to work. We're trying to conduct commerce here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the perspective of management of government, you never want your city shut down,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor, who admits to being &quot;surprised&quot; that, given the number of shots fired, the three officers charged in the Bell shooting were cleared, insists things are different in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand the historical significance of civil disobedience, and too many times that was the only way to effect change,&quot; he said. &quot;However, in this case, there is a continuing federal investigation and interdepartmental investigation. . . . We know a judge determined there was no crime. We accept that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reminded that in a previous political life, he likely would have been front and center in the actions Sharpton is planning, Paterson was unmoved. His role now is to &quot;hear what the demonstration is about and recognize the symbolism of it,&quot; he said. To participate as governor would be &quot;a little pretentious,&quot; Paterson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton indicated he was a bit surprised by Paterson's change - but said he still respects the governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sentiment we express is with Dr. King's style of civil disobedience in mind, which is the same sentiment he [Paterson] had in 1999 when he and his dad [Harlem political leader Basil Paterson] joined me in this style of Dr. King civil disobedience at 1 Police Plaza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor's concern about Sharpton's tactics is yet another example of his remaking himself as he puts his stamp on the office he unexpectedly ascended to following the spectacular prostitution-linked fall of Eliot Spitzer last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his days as a senator, Paterson sponsored legislation to require police to shoot to harm rather than kill - a move opposed by Spitzer and one that sparked the ire of police unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has since disavowed the measure and withdrawn his active support for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paterson is widely viewed as a liberal, given his opposition to the death penalty and support of gay marriage and abortion rights, but Sharpton has referred to the new governor as &quot;probably the most conservative of our generation of black leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;David is the one that if there was a police brutality case would say, 'I'm going to call the police unions as well; we must have balance,' &quot; Sharpton said in Albany just prior to Paterson's March 17 swearing-in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't think of an issue that David didn't try to moderate,&quot; the rev said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paterson said he spoke to Sharpton on Friday after Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman's verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor said he called Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre Bell, after the verdict and will meet with her soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As soon as it's desired, I will meet with her,&quot; Paterson said. &quot;Whether or not a crime was committed, she's still a victim. She's a victim because her fianc&eacute; was killed. It may or may not have been a crime, but everyone agrees his death was tragic. He wasn't carrying a weapon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
