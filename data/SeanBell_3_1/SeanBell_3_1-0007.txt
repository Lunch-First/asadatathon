Elvis Duran's Morning Zoo on WHTZ (100.3 FM) continues its long roll in the morning, according to the winter Arbitron ratings released yesterday.
Among its target audience of 18- to 34-year-olds, Duran's squad pulls more than 12% of the audience, meaning about one person in eight is listening to Z100.
The station itself is also having a strong run, reflecting what Senior Vice President of Programming Tom Poleman calls "the 10-year cycle ... when great mainstream pop music comes back around." 
Maybe the best news for Z100 is that the station does even better in the Portable People Meter (PPM) system Arbitron is putting into play this fall.

 AFTERMATH: Hosts and callers on black radio stations remained livid yesterday over the not-guilty verdicts in the 

 trial Friday.
DJ Envy of WQHT (97.1 FM) was one of several who targeted the comment by Mayor Bloomberg and others that "there were no winners or losers."
"I think when you're dead, there was a loser," said Envy. "When your fiance will never seen you again, there was a loser."
Ed Lover of WWPR (105.1 FM) said the only positive thing he could see was that "we didn't burn our neighborhoods down. We kept it under control."
Bob Slade of WRKS (98.7 FM) focused on news developments, including the call by 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement for a permanent special prosecutor to deal with cases of police shootings.
The angriest host was Miss Jones of WQHT, who wished lethal illness on Michael Palladino, president of the New York Detectives Association. She felt he showed a callous attitude toward the victims when he was issuing a statement after the verdict commending the judge.
After she said that, a city police officer called to say that confrontational rhetoric is the path to more bloodshed.
She snapped back, "If you get a hundred, we'll get 50 of you. ... Blue doesn't mean anything here."
