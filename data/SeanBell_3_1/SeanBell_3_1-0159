<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Three New York police officers were acquitted Friday on all charges of gunning down an unarmed black man hours before his wedding, in a verdict that drew cries of shame from the courthouse gallery and muted victory cheers from officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After weeks of hearing testimony, Justice Arthur Cooperman pronounced not-guilty verdicts against three police detectives who had opened fire in November 2006 on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, as he left a nightclub in the borough of Queens after celebrating his stag night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell died on the spot and two of his friends were wounded. An investigation showed that none of the victims was armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the detectives, Gescard Isnora and Michael Oliver, faced up to 25 years in jail on charges of manslaughter while the third, detective Marc Cooper, faced one year in jail on the lesser charge of reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cries of &quot;Shame on you&quot; rang out in the Queens courthouse, packed with spectators including Bell's fiancee and family, when the controversial verdicts were read out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver fired 31 shots in the incident, Isnora fired 11, and Cooper fired four times, according to testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper apologized to Bell's family following the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,&quot; an emotional Cooper. He then gave thanks for his acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to thank the Lord, my savior, for today. This has started my life back,&quot; said Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same news conference, the head of the New York City Detectives Endowment Association, the union representing the officers, hailed the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I stood at this microphone many months ago and said that this union would not blink; we would mount a vigorous defense for these detectives and we did that,&quot; union chief Michael Palladino said.</SPAN></P>
