PLAINCLOTHES COPS and state court officers guarded the home of Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman yesterday, the day after he cleared the three cops who killed 
 in a 50-bullet barrage. 
Two unmarked police cars with tinted windows were stationed outside the brick home in Queens.
Plainclothes officers also kept watch from a vehicle parked in a neighbor's driveway, and a state court officer's car circled the block every few minutes.
Cooperman has become a focal point for Bell's supporters who disagree with his verdict.
While delivering his ruling, the judge said he did not believe the testimony of Bell's two wounded pals, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield.
He cited their inconsistent statements, courtroom demeanor and rap sheets. Benefield's testimony, in particular, "had the effect of eviscerating the credibility of those prosecution witnesses," Cooperman said.
"At times, the testimony just didn't make sense," he said.
His words upset the Rev. Al Sharpton, Bell's parents and his fiance, who have pledged to organize a series of nonviolent protests around the city. On Friday, Sharpton said supporters should be willing to get themselves arrested "whether it is on Wall Street, the judge's house or at 1 Police Plaza."
When asked yesterday about the security for the judge, Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said: "We do not discuss the security arrangements for any individual."
Cooperman, a married father of three, is a 74-year-old former Army lieutenant who has jailed police and criminals alike.
He has spent nearly three years on the bench and overseen more than 500 criminal and civil trials, including 80 homicides, and has a reputation of being evenhanded. He previously served a decade in the state Assembly.
He is slated for mandatory retirement at the end of next year.
