<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOWNPATRICK are being forced to field a tender generation of players - and are suffering the consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young, enthusiastic, snappy and full of bite they may be, but the severe lack of physical power and experience is taking its toll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their time will come but the club's minor players were no match for an ordinary Shamrocks team that made the most of their more physical strength, destroying the match as a contest six minutes into the second half when Eoin Magennis rifled in his side's second goal to open up a nine points lead, 2-09 to 1-03. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This crunching defeat at Pairc Tomas Ruiseil came on the heels of an opening day knock-out by Ballymartin, their staggering start already plunging the RGU into dog-fight territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Peter Telford, Michael McGarrity, Kevin Gracey, Richard Starkey, Peter Robinson, Tony McShane, to name but a few, the final scoreline all too harshly relating the story of a one-sided contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no real support for big Peter Turley who strove majestically to spur his younger team-mates on and who might have snatched a couple of goals in the second half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His younger brother, Damian, is now a full fledged senior player and well worth his place in the side, fired in a goal in the fourth minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karl Oakes and Barry Gracey attempted to add some experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a free flowing Shamrocks were never seriously threatened and as the contest unfolded they continued to rack up the scores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It didn't take them long to register their intentions, opening up a three points lead in the opening three minutes, a Kevin McGuigan free, and a point apiece from Neil Courtney and Marty Rafferty sounding out the warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Turley hammered to the net in Downpatrick's first attack to level the score at 1-00 to 0-03, but that was as good as it got for the Hoops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noel Henney fed Paul Rafferty with a lovely pass and he cracked a left footed beauty to the net to fire his side back in front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further points from Rafferty, following a brilliant scything move, Paul Rafferty and Henney saw Shamrocks soar ahead 1-07 to 1-00 by the 20th minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gareth Trainor grabbed a home point before young James Deeny stood up to Paul Rafferty's fierce shot to make a magnificent save in the 23rd minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An exchange of points between McGuigan and Karl Oakes set the half-time score at 1-08 to 1-02 in favour of Shamrocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young Jarleth Brannigan will undoubtedly become a very good gaelic footballer at senior level in the not too distant future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continually active, packed with enthusiasm and a mischievous raider, he added a new dimension to the stuttering Downpatrick front play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He still looks fragile at this level though but all credit to him for scoring three well-taken points in the second half after entering the match at the interval but with Shamrocks in total control was never any danger to the south down side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eoin Magennis dealt the hammer blow with his snap goal and from then on it was only a matter of how many more scores Shamrocks could pencil in before the final whistle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Rafferty slammed in their third goal and further points from Magennis, Courtney and Marty Rafferty wrapped up a fine victory for Shamrocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RGU: James Deeny, Davy McCauley, Joe Starkey, Michael Breen, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barry Gracey, Liam Kearney, Peter Turley, Damian Turley, Garett Trainor, Caolan Boyd, Gerdie Collins, John Smyth, Karl Oaks, Neil Cunningham, (Subs) Vinnie McDevitt, Peter McKenna, Jarleth Brannigan, Danny Carville.</SPAN></P>
