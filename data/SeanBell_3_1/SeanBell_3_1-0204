<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANGRY chants of ``KKK'' and ``murderers'' rang out in New York as three police detectives were acquitted of killing an unarmed black man in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict in the racially charged </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case -- which raised questions about whether the New York police were trigger-happy and used excessive force -- placed the city on high alert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg appealed for calm after the decision, saying: ``We don't expect violence or law-breaking, nor is there any place for it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city remained calm, with protests limited to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">minor angry scuffles outside the Queens County Court, when the verdict was delivered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, a 23-year-old father of two, died in a hail of 50 bullets outside the seedy Kalua Cabaret strip-club in Jamaica, Queens, on November 25, 2006, after leaving his bachelor party with friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three undercover detectives, who were at the club investigating reports of prostitution, claimed they believed one of the men was armed. No gun was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman found the officers not guilty and suggested the prosecution witnesses had been unreliable. He found the shooting was careless, but not reckless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``At times, the testimony of those witnesses just didn't make sense,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The people have not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant was not justified (in firing),'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cries of ``shame on you'' filled the courtroom after the decision and extra</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">police converged on the courthouse to maintain calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said the three officers could still face internal disciplinary action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But first, the US Justice Department is reviewing the case to determine whether to pursue a federal civil rights prosecution against the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bell family is also considering an appeal and is suing the city in a civil damages claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers Michael Oliver, 36, and Gescard Isnora, 29, were put on trial for manslaughter and faced a maximum 25 years in jail. A third officer, Marc Cooper, 40, was charged with reckless</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Det Oliver, who fired 31 bullets on the night of the shooting, said Justice Cooperman had made a ``fair and just decision''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I'd like to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights activist the Rev Al Sharpton was incensed at the verdict and described it as ``one round down'' and vowed ``the fight is far from over''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He promised protests</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``to demonstrate to the federal government that New Yorkers will not take this abortion of justice lying down''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``They want us to act crazy so they would have an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">excuse to do more,'' Mr Sharpton said on his daily radio show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We are going to be strategic. We are going to close the city down in a non-violent effective way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev Jesse Jackson said: ``An ugly pattern is emerging in New York. This was a massacre. This was not a shoot-out and the US Attorney-General must give America the assurance that we all have equal protection under the law.''</SPAN></P>
