DETECTIVES Endowment Association President Michael Palladino called a press conference yesterday to trumpet the acquittal of the 
 case cops - but banned Daily News reporters and photographers.
Asked by other media outlets why The News was excluded, Palladino claimed the paper had an "agenda" and mentioned its exclusive interview on Thursday with Bell's parents.
The ban was a hollow gesture. The press conference was carried live on several TV channels.
