<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIERRA MADRE, Calif. Firefighters gained ground Sunday against an early season wildfire that slowly chewed its way through dense brush near Los Angeles, forcing more than 1,000 people from homes in the foothills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 500 firefighters attacked the 400-acre fire, aided by two helicopters and water-dropping air tankers, said Elisa Weaver, spokeswoman for the city of Sierra Madre. Residents evacuated at least 550 homes Saturday night and Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crews had the fire 30 percent contained by Sunday evening, Sierra Madre spokesman James Carlson said. Light winds and rising humidity were aiding firefighters, who hoped to have the blaze fully contained within four to seven days, Carlson said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aircraft were also helping fire officials assess the movement of the blaze, which was being pushed northwest into Angeles National Forest, said Batallion Chief Tim Davis of the Forest Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police-shooting acquittal spurs calls for changes </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK A coalition of civil rights advocates on Sunday urged changes in the handling of police misconduct and brutality complaints after the acquittal of three officers involved in the shooting death of an unarmed man on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also called for a permanent state-level special prosecutor to investigate such cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case proves it is almost impossible to successfully prosecute cases of police misconduct, especially in homicide cases,&quot; said lawyer Norman Siegel, former head of the New York Civil Liberties Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict underscores the need for systemic change in the way New York handles these important and at times high profile cases, and to improve community relations,&quot; said Siegel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three city police officers were cleared Friday in the November 2006 shooting death of Bell outside a nightclub where he had just left his bachelor party. Two friends were wounded in the volley of 50 shots fired by undercover officers and colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers charged said they thought they were in mortal danger, but no gun was found in Bell's car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siegel was joined at a news conference outside police headquarters by state Sen. Eric Adams and retired police officer Marq Claxton. Adams and Claxton co-founded 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams, a former police captain, said the state-level special prosecutor's office should be reinstated permanently by law. A previous special prosecutor's office was created by former Gov. Nelson Rockefeller in 1974 but abolished in 1993 by Gov. Mario Cuomo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teen arrested in slaying of four family members </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EASLEY, S.C. A teenager who had recently moved back home after breaking up with his live-in girlfriend is accused of gunning down and killing four family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nathaniel Dickson, 18, was arrested Saturday night at a home in Belton, S.C., about 20 miles from where the bodies of his father, stepmother, stepsister and younger brother were found, authorities said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities would not talk about a possible motive. &quot;I'm going to have this case tried in the courtroom, not out on the streets,&quot; Anderson County Sheriff David Crenshaw said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dickson's father was found shot early Saturday in the yard of his one-story house in a wooded neighborhood just outside of Easley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samuel Andrew Dickson Jr., 46, died as paramedics arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers then went inside and found the bodies of his wife, Martiza Hurtado Dickson, 46; Melissa Giliam Salazar, 19; and Taylor Dickson, 14. All had been shot to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, D.C., to begin bicycle-sharing service </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON More Washingtonians could be pedaling to meetings on Capitol Hill and other appointments when the city launches the nation's first European-style bike-sharing service next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program, called SmartBike D.C., is similar to car-sharing services like Zipcar. Users must sign up for a $40 annual membership to gain access to a network of bikes stored at computerized racks around the city. To unlock the bike, users simply scan their access cards. The bikes can be used for up to three hours at a time and can be returned at any SmartBike station. In the beginning at least, there won't be any hourly charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The District of Columbia program is starting small, with just 10 stations and 120 bikes. In contrast, Paris started its service last summer with more than 10,600 bikes at 750 stations. But D.C. officials are eager to expand it quickly if the response is good. Proponents say the program easily could be expanded to more than 1,000 bikes at more than 100 stations within a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is one more transportation option for residents, visitors and workers,&quot; said Jim Sebastian, who runs the D.C. Department of Transportation's bicycle programs.</SPAN></P>
