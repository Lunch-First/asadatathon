THE WOMAN who would have been 

 mother-in-law prayed yesterday that the three cops who gunned him down in a 50-bullet barrage are convicted. 
Laura Harper-Paultre said she also prayed that there will be peace in Queens "no matter what."
"No matter what the verdict is, it won't bring Sean back," she said. "I just prayed for justice. But no matter what it is, Sean is dead. Guilty or not guilty, Sean is dead."
Harper-Paultre spoke at the Community Church of Christ in the Jamaica section, where about a dozen Bell supporters gathered for a 24-hour prayer vigil.
Bell's mother, Valerie, stopped by a few hours later after work. "It's in God's hands right now," she said.
Bell's father, William, and fiance, Nicole, were expected to take part in the vigil.
This morning, Bell supporters will march from the church to Queens Supreme Court, where Justice Arthur Cooperman will read his verdict shortly after 9 a.m.
"Miraculously, I don't feel any anxiety," Harper-Paultre said. "I'm very optimistic about tomorrow. I have faith in Judge Cooperman and in God."
Bell, 23, was killed on his wedding day, Nov. 25, 2006, around the corner from a Queens topless club where he'd just had his bachelor party. Two buddies who were in Bell's car, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, were badly wounded.
Shortly afterward, Bell's fiance legally took his last name. She is the mother of Bell's two daughters.
Bishop Lester Williams said, "I feel like a person who has been sentenced to die in an electric chair and this is my last day on earth."
"This has been a burden on the community," Williams said. "Today is the eve of the unknown . . . Our prayers here are that the citizens will respect the decision of the judge."
Detectives Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora are charged with manslaughter, felony assault and reckless endangerment. Detective Marc Cooper is charged with reckless endangerment.
