<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elvis Duran's Morning Zoo on WHTZ (100.3 FM) continues its long roll in the morning, according to the winter Arbitron ratings released yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among its target audience of 18- to 34-year-olds, Duran's squad pulls more than 12% of the audience, meaning about one person in eight is listening to Z100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The station itself is also having a strong run, reflecting what Senior Vice President of Programming Tom Poleman calls &quot;the 10-year cycle ... when great mainstream pop music comes back around.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the best news for Z100 is that the station does even better in the Portable People Meter (PPM) system Arbitron is putting into play this fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">SEAN</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">BELL</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFTERMATH: Hosts and callers on black radio stations remained livid yesterday over the not-guilty verdicts in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trial Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DJ Envy of WQHT (97.1 FM) was one of several who targeted the comment by Mayor Bloomberg and others that &quot;there were no winners or losers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think when you're dead, there was a loser,&quot; said Envy. &quot;When your fiance will never seen you again, there was a loser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Lover of WWPR (105.1 FM) said the only positive thing he could see was that &quot;we didn't burn our neighborhoods down. We kept it under control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Slade of WRKS (98.7 FM) focused on news developments, including the call by 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement for a permanent special prosecutor to deal with cases of police shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The angriest host was Miss Jones of WQHT, who wished lethal illness on Michael Palladino, president of the New York Detectives Association. She felt he showed a callous attitude toward the victims when he was issuing a statement after the verdict commending the judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After she said that, a city police officer called to say that confrontational rhetoric is the path to more bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She snapped back, &quot;If you get a hundred, we'll get 50 of you. ... Blue doesn't mean anything here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
