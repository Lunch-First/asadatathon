The governor of New York said he was "surprised" by the acquittal of three police officers who shot dead an unarmed black man on his wedding day in a hail of bullets. 
David Paterson's comments came after a top civil rights leader pledged to "close" New York City with protests over the verdicts.
 23, was killed when undercover officers fired 50 shots at him and his friends as he left his stag party at the Club Kahlua strip bar in New York on November 25, 2006, hours before he was to wed his high school sweetheart.
Three of the officers, who had the club under surveillance for prostitution and drugs, were charged with offences from manslaughter to reckless endangerment for firing 46 of the 50 shots, but were cleared by Justice Arthur Cooperman at the Queens State Supreme Court on Friday.
The defence told the judge, who heard the case without a jury at the defendants' request, an officer confronted Mr Bell and his friends after hearing one of the group say: "Go get my gat," slang for gun.
The officers - Gescard Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper - said they began firing when Mr Bell's Nissan Altima car tried to run over the detective.
Last night Mr Paterson said the verdicts surprised him because of the number of shots fired.
