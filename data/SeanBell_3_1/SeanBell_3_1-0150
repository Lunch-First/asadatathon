<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three New York City police detectives have been acquitted in the killing of an unarmed black man who died in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day. The news prompted angry demonstrations and a federal review.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New York state judge cleared two officers of manslaughter and a third of reckless endangerment in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (23) who was shot, along with two friends, after a bachelor party at a strip club in November 2006. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal authorities said they would consider civil rights charges under a review by the Justice Department, federal prosecutors and the FBI.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will &quot;take appropriate action if the evidence indicates a prosecutable violation&quot; of federal civil rights laws, the Justice Department said in a statement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, hundreds of demonstrators yelled, pushed and shoved as police, reporters and spectators packed the path outside the court building. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're murderers, criminals, and they are going to rot in hell where they belong,&quot; one man shouted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">demonstrators </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, about 1,000 people marched from the courthouse to the site of the shooting, pumping fists, shouting &quot;Justice for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NYPD go to hell&quot; and counting from one to 50.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing has outraged New York's black community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a similar case a decade ago, four officers who fired 41 shots were acquitted in the death of an unarmed West African man, Amadou Diallo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shows that there is no justice in America for the black man,&quot; said BM Marcus, a community organiser. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gescard Isnora, a black Hispanic undercover officer who fired first, said he followed Bell and his friends to Bell's car believing they were getting a gun to settle a dispute at the club. Isnora said he opened fire after being grazed by Bell's car as the men tried to drive away.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other officers arrived after the initial confrontation and said they believed Isnora was being fired at from inside the car.  </SPAN></P>
