NEW YORK: Three New York City police officers were last night found innocent of all charges in the shooting death of an unarmed black man killed in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day.
A New York State Supreme Court judge cleared two officers of manslaughter and other charges and a third of reckless endangerment in the death of 
 23, who was shot, along with two friends, after a bachelor party at a strip club in November 2006.
Shouts of ``No'' erupted in the crowd outside the courthouse as word of the verdict spread.
Undercover officer Gescard Isnora had followed Bell and his two friends to Bell's car believing they went to fetch a gun to settle a dispute at the club. He opened fire after being grazed by the car.
The other officers reached Bell's car after the initial confrontation and said they believed Isnora was being fired at from inside the vehicle.
