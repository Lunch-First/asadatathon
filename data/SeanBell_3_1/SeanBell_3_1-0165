<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four hours after their acquittal, Detectives Gescard F. Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper appeared in a room crowded with reporters and cameras, speaking publicly for the first time since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> died in a hail of 50 police bullets on his wedding day in November 2006. The detectives' remarks were brief and, with the exception of Detective Cooper's, all but stripped of emotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Oliver's face was impassive, and but for his reddened eyes, almost unreadable. Detective Isnora held his mouth in a tight line, and his eyes were bloodshot. But it was only Detective Cooper, the third of the officers to be acquitted on Friday, who offered a telling glimpse of the burden he felt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Cooper had faced the least serious charge, reckless endangerment, in part for shooting through the window of an AirTrain station the night Mr. Bell died. He was the last of the detectives to speak, and when he stepped to the lectern, he gripped it with both hands, dropped his head, and drew a long, shaky breath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'd like to, uh,'' he said, and then stopped. Seconds ticked by. His hands nervously worked the sides of the lectern, back and forth, back and forth, before he raised his head and picked up midstream, ''say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,'' he said. ''I'd like to thank the Lord, my savior, for today. This is the start of my life back.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Isnora, who fired 11 shots and was acquitted of first- and second-degree manslaughter and other charges, spoke first, standing in a packed basement conference room at the headquarters of the Detectives' Endowment Association in Lower Manhattan. ''Hi, good afternoon,'' he said, and then mumbled a bit before continuing, ''I'd like to thank the Lord Jesus Christ.'' He went on to thank his family and the judge in the case, Justice Arthur J. Cooperman. His remarks lasted less than 30 seconds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Oliver, who fired 31 shots and was also acquitted of first-  and second-degree manslaughter and other charges, had wept when the verdict was read, according to his lawyer, James J. Culleton. Yet at the news conference, the detective was largely impassive. ''Good afternoon, I'd like to just say thank you to all my family and friends,'' he said, before thanking the detectives' association, the judge and the defense lawyers in the case. His statement was just 36 words long and was nearly drowned out by the clatter of cameras clicking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The detectives arrived at the courthouse in Kew Gardens, Queens, about 8:30 a.m. to hear Justice Cooperman decide their fate. They used a side entrance, where a cordon of police officers and metal gates held back a throng of reporters and cameramen. They were whisked out a back door seconds after Justice Cooperman read his verdict, shortly after 9 a.m. News of the verdict caused roars of outrage in the crowd out front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is unclear what the future holds for the three detectives, who, according to the lawyers, are all eager to get back to regular police work. All three, who were initially suspended, surrendered their shields and guns and have been on desk duty, and may yet be disciplined by the Police Department. But first the United States attorney's office must weigh whether to pursue federal civil charges against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The lawyers for each of the detectives said that their clients were still reeling from the shock and relief that the verdict had brought, and were not willing to give individual interviews. Each detective had been in deep retreat for the last 17 months, their lawyers said, rarely venturing outside their homes, and finding solace in family members and close friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's been hell for him,'' said Philip E. Karasyk, who represented Detective Isnora. ''He's been a nervous wreck.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Isnora, 29, who is of Haitian and Mexican descent, was born in Brooklyn and lives in Bushwick with his mother. As a youngster he was a solid student, Mr. Karasyk said, attending the High School for Mathematics, Science and Engineering at City College and working as a lifeguard for the city. Mr. Karasyk said the Isnora family had been very proud when he became a police officer. But after the Bell shooting, neighborhood sentiment turned sharply against him, according to Pablo Rios, who lives across the street from the family. Mr. Rios said that Detective Isnora's sister was so routinely harassed as she made her way to work that she moved to Staten Island to get away from the hostility. ''Literally, she was scared,'' Mr. Rios said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Cooper, 40, lives in  Orange County with his wife and three children, said his lawyer, Paul P. Martin. Detective Cooper, who is black, was especially crushed by allegations that racism prompted the shooting, Mr. Martin said, because he had mentored black youngsters, worked to get guns off the street, and had been a member of the Guardians Association, a black fraternal group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's been ostracized,'' Mr. Martin said, ''and he felt betrayed by the African-American community.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Culleton, the lawyer, said that Detective Oliver had been ''vilified since Day 1.'' Since the shooting, Detective Oliver, 36, who grew up in New Jersey and now lives in Manhattan, had been characterized in some media accounts as somewhat of a playboy and bon vivant and was also labeled as arrogant. But Mr. Culleton said that his client was haunted by Mr. Bell's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He is very upset with what happened,'' Mr. Culleton said. ''And he's going to have to deal with it for the rest of his life.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the news conference, Michael J. Palladino, the president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, lashed out at critics of the Police Department and of the three detectives. He said the district attorney's office had omitted critical information when they presented the case to the grand jury, which indicted the three detectives. Mr. Palladino also leveled criticism at Mr. Bell's friends Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, who were both gravely injured in the shooting, and who testified during the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After offering his sympathy to the Bell family, Mr. Palladino quickly followed with a defense of the detectives, and of police work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We have been portrayed as insensitive murderers,'' he said. ''And I can tell you that we are not.''</SPAN></P>
