<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK: Three detectives were found not guilty in the shooting death of an unarmed black man, killed in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day -- prompting angry reactions yesterday and a federal review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New York state judge cleared two policemen of manslaughter and other charges and a third of reckless endangerment in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23. Mr Bell was shot, along with two friends, after a bachelor party at a strip club in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal authorities said they would consider civil rights charges, after a review by the Justice Department, federal prosecutors and the FBI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will ``take appropriate action, if the evidence indicates a prosecutable violation of federal criminal civil rights statutes,'' a departmental statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, hundreds of demonstrators yelled angrily, amid pushing and shoving in the crowd as police, reporters and spectators packed the footpath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader Al Sharpton, who has been highly critical of police, called for wider protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``They want us to act crazy, so they would have an excuse to do more,'' Sharpton told his radio audience. ``We are going to be strategic. We are going to close the city down in a non-violent way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael Bloomberg called for calm, saying: ``We don't expect violence or law-breaking, nor is there any place for it''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case generated outrage in New York's black community, but police said they did not expect violence because numerous demonstrations against the perceived police brutality had been peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``It shows that there is no justice in America for the black man. This is telling us the cops can do whatever they want and get away with it,'' said B.M.Marcus, a community organiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquitted officers thanked their friends and families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I'd like to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,'' said detective Marc Cooper, acquitted of a reckless endangerment charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other detectives, Gescard Isnora and Mike Oliver, were charged with manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three men waived their right to a jury and opted to have a judge decide guilt or innocence. Defence lawyers said local jurors were likely to be biased against the police, with heavy media coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supreme Court Judge Arthur Cooperman said the charges could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt, after some witnesses changed their testimony and may have had motivation to lie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge accepted the police felt in danger, adding: ``Questions of carelessness and incompetence must be left to other forums''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the fateful night, Isnora followed Bell and friends to a car, believing they went to get a gun to resolve a row. He fired after being grazed as Bell drove off. The other two said they believed Isnora was being fired at from inside the car.</SPAN></P>
