ERIC Munkman's legs gave out on him three years ago, but seated in a wheelchair for Sydney's Anzac Day parade brought him eye-to-eye with its youngest participants.
And the 89-year-old World War II veteran says he likes what he sees: A generation of Australians shining with pride in their nation's
servicemen and women.
Yesterday an estimated 230,000 spectators cheered as more than 21,000 marchers from home and abroad took to the streets of Sydney.
The crowd was up by about 40,000 on last year and the number of marchers by 1000 -- and their spirits were
higher than ever.
``It's very emotional. The blokes really appreciate the people standing on the sidelines and cheering them on,'' Mr Munkman's daughter Beryl Dodds said.
She pushed her father's wheelchair for the first time yesterday and admitted to a few tears during the march.
``I had a little cry ... everyone came together as one to support those who served their country,'' she said.
For his part, Mr Munkman said he had ``quite enjoyed'' the occasion, which saw him high-fiving the crowd.
For the family and friends of the 645 sailors who perished on HMAS Sydney in 1941, yesterday's march was particularly emotional, coming just a month after the wreck was finally located.
``I was only nine years old when my Uncle Leonard was killed in action,'' 76-year-old Grace Russell said.
``I remember I came home from school and my father was crying in the bedroom. He'd just received a telegram from the War Department.''
 whose grandfather David Shepherd died when the ship was sunk, made the journey from Perth to represent his family: ``None of us fought for our country but we know how to honour those who did,'' he said.
Similar sentiments were voiced at the dawn service at Martin Place hours earlier.
A record attendance, estimated at 35,000, became a rainbow vista of umbrellas, hats and anything from bin liners to plastic coats worn to deflect the rain.
Land Commander of Australia Maj-Gen Mark Kelly told the crowd that the word ``Anzac'' referred to more than a military campaign: ``It has transcended the physical meaning to become a spirit, an inspiration which embodies courage, discipline, sacrifice, self-reliance and, in Australian terms, mateship and a fair go,'' he said.
Across the state, Dawn Services were held in numerous regional centres, including Newcastle, Bathurst, Lithgow and Albury.
In Gosford, 88-year-old former bomber pilot John Leeuwin-Clark said it was gratifying so many had braved the weather.
``We all have stories and this is a nice time of year to think back on your old friends,'' said Mr Leeuwin-Clark, who served in East Africa and the Middle East in World War II.
``Sadly a lot of the boys didn't come home. It's important to remember them.''
One woman doing just that was Legacy widow Gwen Miller from Liverpool, who attended the Sydney parade alone for the first time since her husband Gordon's death last year.
She felt he was nonetheless there in spirit: ``He's with me today -- he's always with me. I've got his medals on and I'm wearing his picture in a locket around my neck,'' she said.
By mid-morning, Narrabeen resident Lisa Smith, 21, had barely any voice left -- the result of cheering.
``I went to the Dawn
Service so I've been up since 3.45am,'' she said.
