<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PLAINCLOTHES COPS and state court officers guarded the home of Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman yesterday, the day after he cleared the three cops who killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a 50-bullet barrage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two unmarked police cars with tinted windows were stationed outside the brick home in Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plainclothes officers also kept watch from a vehicle parked in a neighbor's driveway, and a state court officer's car circled the block every few minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman has become a focal point for Bell's supporters who disagree with his verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While delivering his ruling, the judge said he did not believe the testimony of Bell's two wounded pals, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited their inconsistent statements, courtroom demeanor and rap sheets. Benefield's testimony, in particular, &quot;had the effect of eviscerating the credibility of those prosecution witnesses,&quot; Cooperman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At times, the testimony just didn't make sense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His words upset the Rev. Al Sharpton, Bell's parents and his fianc&eacute;e, who have pledged to organize a series of nonviolent protests around the city. On Friday, Sharpton said supporters should be willing to get themselves arrested &quot;whether it is on Wall Street, the judge's house or at 1 Police Plaza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked yesterday about the security for the judge, Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said: &quot;We do not discuss the security arrangements for any individual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman, a married father of three, is a 74-year-old former Army lieutenant who has jailed police and criminals alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has spent nearly three years on the bench and overseen more than 500 criminal and civil trials, including 80 homicides, and has a reputation of being evenhanded. He previously served a decade in the state Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is slated for mandatory retirement at the end of next year.</SPAN></P>
