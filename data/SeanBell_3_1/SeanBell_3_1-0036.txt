Local television stations
blew out everything yesterday morning for the 

 verdict, then almost audibly held their breath while waiting to see if the blanket acquittals would trigger an explosive aftermath. 
Their sigh of relief at the largely orderly response among Bell supporters stood in sharp contrast to the tone at black radio stations, where many hosts and callers immediately expressed frustration and fury.
"Don't go tearing your neighborhood up," said Ed Lover, morning host on WWPR (105.1 FM). "But I'm so mad I don't know what to do. This is a travesty of justice. It's like black life in New York don't matter."
"These families wanted some justice," said Bob Slade, news director of WRKS (98.7 FM). "They didn't get any."
WBLS (107.5 FM) morning host Steve Harvey said, "We're sick and tired. This country needs to be repaired."
When a caller to WQHT (97.1 FM) talked about "channeling our anger to something positive," morning host Miss Jones said, "Maybe this isn't the time to suppress our anger," though she added that she wasn't advocating violence.
With neither the acquitted officers nor the families of victims making public statements (even the Rev. Al Sharpton held off), television's coverage after the verdict felt muted.
All the local stations sent reporters to the scene, but often stayed with crowd shots from helicopters.
Reporters assessed the verdict with analysts, who generally agreed that the prosecution was not able to make a case that was convincing enough.
Hosts on talk-radio WABC (770 AM) were more sympathetic toward the officers.
"Whatever 

 and his homeboys were doing, they didn't deserve to die," said WABC's Curtis Sliwa. "But anyone who thinks a police officer goes into any situation looking to pull his gun and shoot somebody is insane."
