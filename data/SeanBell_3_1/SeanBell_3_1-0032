<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE QUEENS DISTRICT attorney defended his office's handling of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trial yesterday, despite a lackluster assessment by the judge who cleared the police of all charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did our job,&quot; District Attorney Richard Brown said at a press conference following the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court has now spoken, and it's now up to us to do everything in our power to make certain that we learn from that which occurred and to do whatever we can to make certain that it never occurs again,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's office endured stiff criticism from some in the victim's family early in the case for failing to prosecute aggressively enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lead prosecutor Charles Testagrossa, standing at Brown's right hand, defended his team's case, calling the Bell trial &quot;the most difficult case I've ever had to try&quot; in his 31 years on the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You try a case like this, you're going to become a lightning rod for criticism. This is not an easy road,&quot; Testagrossa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice is supposed to be for everybody, that includes people that have had phony convictions, or arrests, and it includes police officers as well. This is what we had to do, and we did it as best we could.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the loss, Testagrossa and Brown praised Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I accept his verdict and I urge that all fair-minded people do the same,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman said prosecutors failed to meet their burden of proof, in part because of failures among their witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, Cooperman attacked the &quot;criminal convictions&quot; and &quot;the demeanor&quot; of some witnesses, in an apparent reference to the hostile testimony of Joseph Guzman on the stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testagrossa defended Guzman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought he was appropriately angry,&quot; Testagrossa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown said he discussed the case with the U.S. Attorney's office and offered his cooperation should they decide to press a civil rights case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These defendants and the others that were involved still have a number of hurdles to cross before someone says they were fully exonerated,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
