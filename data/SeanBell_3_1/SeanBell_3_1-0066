<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8"> LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ... The interlocking of past and present can be seen in Jena in the scene of lynching nooses at integrated schools; in the form of racialized punishment in the era of formal legal equality; and, pointedly, in the ability of a prosecutor to take away a child's life &quot;with the stroke of a pen.&quot; ... In other words, what is at issue is not that Jena has become a high-profile historical event, but rather that the kind of legal and social punishment of blacks that took place in Jena typifies the everyday practice of criminal law and its endorsement by white civil society throughout the nation.  ... In Western culture, freedom came to mean full ownership of property rights in oneself.  ... More importantly, extensive archival evidence from slave narratives exemplifies the routine terror of sexual and other forms of physical and psychological violence under slavery.  ... Leon Higginbotham comments, the Missouri court &quot;held that the end of slavery is not merely 'the economic profit of the master' but also the joy of the master in the sexual conquest of the slave.&quot; ... Power is effectively insulated by the personal subjectivities of those people (still mostly white but now increasingly other races as well) whose investments it represents and deposits in the social structures of this society.  ... This divide does not produce a hierarchy of humanity; instead, it produces a finite schism between the realm of humanity (whites/Europe) and nonhumanity (blacks/Africa).  ... First, it provides cohesion for white civil society against the perceived threat of blackness, and enforces allegiance to white supremacy; second, gratuitous violence against black bodies is the language through which this solidarity is achieved; and third, it is the bridge between slavery and the contemporary prison industrial complex in terms of the impunity claimed by the police and white people's prerogative to ignore this antiblack violence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The welcome sign at the entrance to Jena, Louisiana, describes it as &quot;a nice place to call home.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recent events involving its criminal justice system, however, produce a counternarrative at the intersection of race and law that refutes this slogan. Trouble in Jena arose in September 2006 over the contestation of race and space when a black student named Kenneth Purvis asked Jena High School authorities for permission to sit under the &quot;white tree,&quot; a de facto segregated gathering place exclusively occupied by white students during school breaks. The school principal informed Purvis that he could sit wherever he pleased, and along with two of his buddies, the young man did just that.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following morning, the student body arrived to find three nooses, painted black, dangling from the tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly afterwards, white District Attorney J. Walters Reed accompanied several police officers to address a Jena High School assembly. In a throwback to the days of Bull Connor, he threatened the black students for protesting and &quot;making a fuss about this innocent prank,&quot; claiming that he could be their &quot;best friend or worst enemy.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next he informed the black students, &quot;With the stroke of my pen, I can make your lives disappear.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*236]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Joiner provided the students with a didactic lesson in the history of race and law in America: blacks are more likely to be victimized by state violence than they are to be recipients of equal protection from the rule of law.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The school was put on lockdown for the remainder of the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that fall, on November 30, 2006, a fire burned down the main academic building of Jena High School. The next evening, December 1, 2006, a black student possessing a printed invitation to a white party was beaten up, and on December 2, 2006, Matt Windham, a young white man, pulled out a shotgun in a confrontation with several black youth at a local convenience store. When the black youth defended themselves and seized the gun, they were arrested for theft of a firearm,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> second-degree robbery,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and conspiracy  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to commit second-degree robbery. No charges were filed against the white man.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, on December 4, 2006, at Jena High School, a white student named Justin Barker--who allegedly was making racial taunts, including calling the African American students &quot;niggers&quot; and supporting the white students who hung the nooses and beat up the black student off-campus--was knocked down, punched, and kicked by six black students.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The white provocateur was taken to the hospital, treated, and released with minor bruises. He attended a social function that evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All six black teens were charged with attempted second-degree murder, a charge that was later determined to be unsubstantiated according to the Louisiana Criminal Code.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amidst controversy, Prosecutor Reed reduced the charges to aggravated second-degree battery  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and conspiracy to commit aggravated second-degree battery.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under Louisiana criminal law, the aggravated charge requires the use of a weapon. Prosecutor Walters argued the tennis shoes worn by Mychal Bell, one of the black teens, and used to kick Barker constituted the dangerous weapons, an argument the jury ultimately accepted.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, the system continued to exact its violence. Public defender Blane Williams, himself a black man, not only encouraged Bell to accept a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*237]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plea for a crime that was unsubstantiated by the facts of the case, but he failed to perform his duties as a zealous advocate for his client.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williams failed to challenge the all-white jury composition  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and rested the defense without offering any evidence or calling a single witness.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The jury deliberated less than three hours and returned a conviction for Mychal Bell.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Edna Thompson, a long-time friend of the Bells, summed up the jury's decision: &quot;The best thing if you're black in this town is to stay out of the system, because once they get you, you're done for. You're not getting out.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public outrage, protests, and rallies helped provoke judicial review, which overturned the conviction on the grounds that Bell should have been tried as a juvenile since he was sixteen at the time of his arrest.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 3, 2007, Bell pled guilty to a reduced charge of battery and was sentenced to eighteen months in a juvenile facility. The cases of the remaining five youth, four of whom were over seventeen at the time of the incident--legal adults in Louisiana--are still pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These six lives remain suspended in what we are characterizing here as the legal proceedings of &quot;raw life.&quot; To live in the era of raw life is to occupy the crossroads of life and death. The interlocking of life and death signals the entanglement of past, present, and future.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Cornel West, in characterizing the United States in the twenty-first century as a &quot;twilight civilization&quot; replete with &quot;pervasive cultural decay&quot; and the &quot;dangerous rumblings&quot; of the stigmatized, policed, and degraded Others, illuminates the retrograde direction of this society at the very moment of its most powerful ascendancy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the Postcolonial theorist Achille Mbembe, this emergent temporal context--the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">time</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of black suffering--is marked by a future horizon that is apparently closed, while the past appears to have receded. Ours is thus a &quot;time of entanglement,&quot; a space &quot;where life and death are so entangled that it is no longer possible to distinguish them&quot;: the age of raw life.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The interlocking of past and present can be seen in Jena in the scene of lynching nooses at integrated schools; in the form of racialized &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*238]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  punishment in the era of formal legal equality; and, pointedly, in the ability of a prosecutor to take away a child's life &quot;with the stroke of a pen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the course of the next three parts of this article, we trace the origins and development of raw life. From this vantage point, the form of power operative in our contemporary prison regime is embodied in the desire of whites to literally consume the bodies of racialized Others. The history of colonization is replete with records of Europeans literally carving, cooking, and using the bodies of indigenous Africans and Americans.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The history of North American slavery further demonstrates how modern idioms of power are vested in the fungibility of black bodies--their usefulness for the whims and purposes of whites. Our objective here, then, is to closely examine how the state-sanctioned control of the black body from slavery to the contemporary prison regime--an analysis that usually remains at the level of analogy, that the criminal justice system today is like the slavery of yesterday--illumines just how intimately the past structures contemporary struggles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part I, the &quot;Ethics of Parasitic Pleasure,&quot; reaches back to slavery, the institution through which white desires were given expression and defined value in terms of bodily sovereignty: whites attract honor, respect, and power--</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">value</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">--by virtue of not simply possessing their own bodies, but through their ability to accumulate black bodies as their pleasure-things. We use this socio-legal lens in order to relate the prosecutions in Jena to the formation of the modern Western world and its production of value. Conversely, blacks entered the modern Western world as devalued human beings. So, too, did the six young boys arrested and charged in the Jena case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part II uses the slave codes of the antebellum era to establish the fraudulent ethics surrounding the &quot;rule of law&quot; in the Jena case. The law manifests this fraud in a number of ways worth recounting here. The rule of law presupposes that its subjects have given their consent to being governed, which merely mystifies the reality of captivity, torture, mayhem, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*239]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the requirement of total submission for blacks. At the same time, the law decriminalized the white violence that was essential in holding together the nascent bourgeois democracy. This legal regime also buttressed the moral authority claimed by the ruling class; for decades white violence was cloaked in morality. Yet after the point when such violence became a sign of immorality, the violence did not cease; rather, it became the basis for the fraudulent ethics of white civil society today. This &quot;ethics of fraud,&quot; as we refer to it, helps us understand how Jena unfolded through a legal framing of black criminality versus white innocence--how every act by the black teens was a punishable legal offense, while the white teens violated the law and black bodily sovereignty, with impunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part III uses the post-Emancipation era to reiterate the point that no transcendent moment altered the paradigmatic relation of the black body to the idiom of power that blacks lived under prior to 1865.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gratuitous and irrational violence continued to capture the black body during the era of lynching. Our review of this period contributes a crucial dimension to our understanding of Jena. Lynchings teach us that policing blackness provides indispensable social cohesion for white civil society; that decriminalized white violence is the mechanism by which this community is forged; and therefore that impunity by the police and the ability of whites to ignore this antiblack violence are the marks of a deeper white solidarity that goes beyond differences in region, class, creed, or political affiliation. Part IV concludes with a brief but critical discussion of why the Jena case is fundamental to understanding how white supremacy is so deeply engrained in U.S. culture, in that it not only continues to inform the intrinsic political and psychic structures of this society, but its de facto legality presents little room in which to construct an alternate reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jena Six case emerges from a legal regime with a particular history of perversion regarding the lives of African Americans. Dating back to the slave codes of the South  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and progressing through the Fugitive Slave Acts of 1793 and 1850 (which often exacted harsher punishment than plantation &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*240]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  justice itself)  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to several landmark legal decisions such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Plessy v. Ferguson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1896)  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Pace v. Alabama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1883),  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the law has continuously guaranteed black suffering in terms of black people's status as negated subjects. In the well-known words of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Dred Scott v. Sanford</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision, the Negro was so far inferior that his reduction to slavery was not only &quot;to his benefit&quot; but also that he had &quot;no rights that the white man was bound to respect.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article proffers an analysis of the Jena Six grounded in this historical context, going beyond mere acknowledgment of the debts that our present-day criminal justice system owes to the institution of slavery to approach an assessment of the violence blacks regularly face in the law, an encounter almost so mundane it escapes representation. A wide range of scholars have well documented that the U.S. ruling class crafted the contemporary U.S. prison regime as a replacement for the system of chattel slavery.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This legacy can be seen in our nation's jails and prisons.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As significant scholarship suggests, the Jena Six assumes its place within slavery's modern legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can we move beyond the limits of analogy? The Jena Six is much more complex than a metaphor can convey: What does it mean to be, in the words of Frantz Fanon, &quot;an object in the midst of other objects,&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to live in &quot;the domain of non-existence?&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Born and raised in the French Caribbean colony of Martinique and later educated as a psychiatrist in Lyon, Fanon became an authority on how white supremacy renders the humanity of the colonized subject invisible. When he served as the head clinician at a psychiatric hospital in French-occupied Algeria during the mid-1950s, Fanon came to the realization that the Western discourse on man and civilization--whether in philosophy or medicine--literally expunged the black from existence. For Fanon, therefore, what it means to be &quot;an object in the midst of other objects,&quot; to not be seen as a human being but instead objectified as if he were a chair or a log, is a question that is unapproachable: it exceeds the limits of representation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*241]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What Fanon means by this formulation, and why his insight matters for our purposes here, is that proper recognition of the problem before us is always and already circumscribed by the language we have available to us with which to identify our injuries. Insofar as the law establishes how we name and remedy injustice, it sets out the language in which we must locate our selves. The problem of race, however, cannot be adequately understood through the language of law. In this way, analyzing the Jena case--and other mundane operations of white supremacy--necessitates deconstructing law itself as a racial project in which black existence has been systematically occluded. A major reason for the difficulty in getting close enough to the problem of racial injustice in the law to offer a just response to it is what we have referred to as the entanglements of raw life. The task before us, therefore, is to lay out the ways in which the age of raw life retains the depths of earlier eras: a contingent existence that reveals itself through the guise of legal life and the stark horror of premature death.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our discussion is neither about the legal aspects of the Jena Six case, nor about the six young men whose lives have been irreparably damaged.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former has been well vetted in domestic and international legal discussions, and while a rich treatment of the latter has yet to be done, it remains beyond the scope of this article.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, we examine the socio-legal context that produces the events in Jena and analyze how those events represent a moment of truth in what we refer to as &quot;racial ordinariness&quot;: defined as another instance in the historically invariant punishment of black people, a banal spectacle that gives us the occasion to put black experience at the center of our analysis of U.S. legal regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reviewing the history of the black experience before the law clearly demonstrates that the Jena Six case is anything but unprecedented. U.S. history features a consistent storyline regarding blacks and the law, largely undeviated from--one which historian Mary Frances Berry referred to as &quot;black resistance [to] white law.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Berry reminds us that &quot;[w]hether its policy was action or inaction, the national government has used the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*242]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Constitution in such a way as to make law the instrument for maintaining a racist status quo.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Jena Six case joins this long history of constitutional spectacles--moments where the law is revealed not as the protector of minority rights, as liberal historiographers and philosophers would have us believe  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --as a manifestation of civil society's commitment to not only maintain white dominance in economic, political, social, and military matters, but to effectuate blackness as the most trod-upon station in society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the popular conception of Jena is one of racist excess--of racism corrupting the otherwise fair process of justice--to conceptualize it as such obscures the mundane reality of black punishment. In other words, recounting the history of crimes against constitutionality, as numerous race scholars and historians such as Berry and Derrick Bell have already done, produces the necessary conditions for arguing the banality of the Jena Six case.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it cannot provide the sufficient grounds for gaining traction on what white supremacy means to the U.S. legal regime. Whenever one attempts to speak about the rules of race and power, one is forced back into a discussion of spectacular events--high-profile legal battles such as the Jena Six, for instance.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem is that the spectacular actually camouflages the routine, the normal operation of the law against blacks in all its everyday terror and contempt, its misbehavior and broken ethicality. In other words, what is at issue is not that Jena has become a high-profile historical event, but rather that the kind of legal and social punishment of blacks that took place in Jena </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">typifies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the everyday practice of criminal law and its endorsement by white civil society throughout the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to everyday life, the secret of the law, hidden in plain sight, is that there is no recourse to the disruption of black life by the mundane violence of living in a white supremacist society. The annals of contemporary legalized violence against black bodies are indeed spectacular, and the readily available examples merely hint at the terror defining black existence before the law: from the police beatings of Rodney &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*243]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  King or Oletha Waugh,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the torture of Abner Louima,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the killing of Amadou Diallo,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the violent deaths of Malice Green  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Johnny Gammage,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the recent shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on his wedding day.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From the analytic vantage point of raw life, the racial violence of legal doctrine is also alive and well. The volatility of numerous Reconstruction era cases, briefly mentioned earlier, entangles with contemporary cases such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Wilson v. State</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Lewis v. Casey.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The numerous black men exonerated by DNA evidence and freed from prison through the Innocence Project, the prosecutors and District Attorneys who steadfastly maintain these men's guilt despite the irrefutable scientific evidence, and the numerous anonymous men and women condemned prior to the recent era of technological advances in forensic criminology--these are the signs of raw life in the domain of nonexistence.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To focus on any one of these spectacles is to deploy, and thereby reaffirm, the logic of the law itself. Documenting the law's excesses, in an attempt to explain the paradigm of white supremacist violence, merely renders it nonparadigmatic, and reduces it to the fraudulent ethics on which the law bases its ongoing hegemony. What makes the spectacle &quot;spectacular&quot; is precisely that the essential logic of the law remains unshaken. Such discrete examples cannot represent the spectrum in which this paradigm manifests today--what might be called the &quot;paradigm of policing&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --from the explicit violence of police homicides to the more subtle violence of the Jena Six case and the faceless millions held captive by the prison industrial complex. This violence against the black body is structural and foundational to U.S. society--not contingent or excessive--and it is this banal but essential quality to racism that the spectacular examples render unrecognizable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The objective of this article, therefore, is to take the Jena Six case and examine it not in terms of its excessiveness, but in terms of its ordinariness. Full interrogation and complete understanding requires examining how the law itself has evolved through the state's relationship to captive black &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*244]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bodies. The law is not merely a mechanism for maintaining a racist status quo.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the contrary, the law is itself constituted through state violence against blacks, from slavery to our present-day prison regime. The point to be examined here is historical and socio-legal in the sense that such an inquiry requires situating our particular spectacle--the Jena Six--at the locus of power created through the conjoined forces of the modern state, law, and race. As Fanon called for, however, this kind of analysis necessarily takes us beyond the law, beyond the political economy of inequality, and into the symbolic economy that produces the meaning of racialized bodies in the first place. We suggest that it is at these final levels--the problem of existence, or as W. E. B. DuBois put it, &quot;what it means to be a problem&quot;--that the spectacle of Jena can be grasped finally, not in terms of an instance of excess, but rather as precisely another moment in the invidious ethos of legalized terror that characterizes black suffering in the age of raw life, and constitutes the vernacular for everything in this society.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. JENA AND THE ETHICS OF PARASITIC PLEASURE</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c35">There is a quest for the Negro, the Negro is in demand, one cannot get along without him, he is needed, but only if he is made palatable in a certain way. Unfortunately, the Negro knocks down the system and breaks the treaties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c36"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--W.E.B. Du Bois</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slavery is the indispensable starting point for our inquiry into the kind of state violence that produced the Jena spectacle because it is at this historical juncture that three central tropes of Western society--freedom, the individual, and private property--come together in the form of the law. These particularly Eurocentric concepts indicate a shift in power from the premodern era, globally speaking, but specifically for the experiences of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*245]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  black people. Slavery was the occasion for a transition from a system of property in which &quot;a right to things [is] realized through a hold on persons&quot; to one in which &quot;a hold on persons [is] realized through a right to things.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Western culture, freedom came to mean full ownership of property rights in oneself. This new idiom of power meant that the basic unit of the expansionist societies of Europe in the early modern period was the individual. The concept of rights, including rights to the labor of oneself and others, being vested in the individual, is rightly described as &quot;the peculiar institution,&quot; given its youth with respect to the long history in human civilization of slavery and other bonded relations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The institution of waged labor and the legal regime in which worker and employer related to each other as autonomous agents, then, was just as peculiar to the African and indigenous societies that provided the slave laborers as plantation slavery was to these societies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scope that the relationship between citizen and the state permitted for the individual points to the severe contingency of rights. In their very formulation, rights are relative to their social recognition and institution: subjects possess rights only insofar as they are imbued with value by the social and political systems in which they exist. The social construction of a right is beholden to the prevailing ideologies in which the civil system is based. Europe's emergent Enlightenment philosophers, for example, defined humanity in relationship to reason: to be human meant to possess the capacity for rational thought.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Committed as they were to moral notions of equality and autonomy, Enlightenment philosophers avoided inconsistency by justifying racialized and gendered subordination; this involved denying the rational capacity of women, Africans, and other subaltern peoples.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n61</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With subaltern humanity circumscribed in this way, enslavement, colonization, and discrimination became not only acceptable, but the moral imperative of a civilized people. For instance, John Stuart Mill, one of Europe's most prominent political philosophers, was a committed proponent of England's colonization of India during the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*246]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nineteenth century on the grounds that it advanced general civilizing and utilitarian benefits of capitalist development for the sake of the colonized.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The important point for our purposes here is the deeply imbricated co-formation of European expansionism and imperialism; liberal notions of humanity, reason, autonomy, freedom, and rights; and the construction of racial definition and discourse.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Locke, who served as a colonial administrator like Mill, established the notion that the right to property is as basic as the rights to life and liberty. The context of the emergent Western social and political system, however, permits taking this right to entail a right to property in another human being.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this way, the liberalism of the modern state, which implied the freedom to enslave others, was crucial to European overseas expansion.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ideology of individualism and the rights-bearing subject, therefore, needs closer scrutiny as a significant factor in the European will to conquer.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Western legal tradition emerging from this history of conquest conceives of a right as the conjunction of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">freedom</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to do whatever one chooses and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">claim</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be protected from interference by others (whether individual, group, or state) in so doing.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This individual capacity is translated as a universal power for the subject to act positively to secure his or her needs, and thus to preempt interference, when in fact it is a highly contingent power, resting in part upon the context of conquest.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commitment to the rights-conception of the individual emergent in Western culture reveals an intrinsic conflict that is most clearly played out in racial terms. The right of each individual to unobstructed self-direction and self-rule creates a clash of directions and rules as each individual seeks to assert and impose the inviolability of their rights.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This individualist calculus produces a zero-sum game whereby the rights of some will inevitably mean the denial of another's rights. As French postmodern philosopher Michel Foucault explains, a &quot;right should be viewed . . . not in terms of a legitimacy to be established, but in terms of the subjugation that it instigates.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*247]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a society formed indelibly through racial conquest, the rights of those included will be understood as inviolable primarily by misrecognizing the rights of the excluded as irrelevant. Liberalism's emphasis on equality and universality, however, renders the racial specification of this exclusion in other terms: &quot;just&quot; wars, paternalistic colonialism, civilization, &quot;the march of progress,&quot; &quot;manifest destiny,&quot; and the savage or childlike nature of the enslaved. The champions of individual liberty emerged from Europe to seek their freedom through the enslavement of others. This point is the crux of the matter when the Western ideology of individualism is concerned: any pursuit of emancipation or freedom is curbed at precisely the moment where self-consciousness picks up. When the Western subject begins to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">imagine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> himself or herself as &quot;free,&quot; he or she inevitably does so through an implicit understanding of the control over or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">un-freedom</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of another.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, Western culture, with liberalism's emphasis on individual rights and autonomy, emerges </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">through</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western Europe's clash with Africa and the Americas, not prior to, or simply as a result of, this conquest. In this way the very notion of what it means to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">be</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;free,&quot; to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">possess</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> liberty, is dependent upon an understanding of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">un-freedom</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and knowing which subjects not only are incapable of possessing themselves, but are, moreover, justly acquired and used by others. Throughout the epistemology of Western culture, race is the recurring boundary line between those subjects understood to be human and those humans whose existence was denied.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this way, Western notions of freedom, liberty, individual rights, and property are all profoundly bound up with the enslavement of the racialized Other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Western notions of freedom necessarily require the enslavement of others, another critical question emerges: Why was slavery reserved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">exclusively</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for non-Europeans, and most particularly, for Africans? Why were Europeans not used for slave labor? European history is replete with the practice of labor coercion--the demonstrated willingness by European elites to kill, use, and persecute lower classes and minority groups; and the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*248]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  disposition to deprive people of liberty and conscripting their labor as punishment for behaviors constructed as criminal. All of this social violence makes it appear arbitrary to draw the line at enslavement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, European societies have long-standing practices of internal racialism and of deploying differences to organize hierarchies.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the fact that it would have been much more profitable to enslave fellow Europeans, there is no evidence that Europeans ever considered instituting full chattel slavery of Europeans in their overseas settlements. The decision to enslave Africans was as unthinking as it was a matter of course to not enslave Europeans.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the eleventh century, at least, a civilization ingrained in racialism ultimately found that its formative internal differences were not different enough to enslave.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;brave New World,&quot; built through the transmutation of Africa, was begun by approaching a particular body (the black) with direct relations of force (slavery).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This conception of the modern era contrasts with that of liberal historiography in which modernity is marked by the rise of the bourgeois nation-state and the struggles of white citizen-subjects for membership and political representation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also contrasts with Marxist historiography, which understands the dawn of the modern era to be the struggles between a white body and variable capital (waged relations).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The slave is the very condition of possibility not only for capitalism and the success of Enlightenment notions of the civilized, rational, and unraced subject; it is also the foundation on which legal discourse arises. Our purpose here is to relocate rights as the result of a &quot;fatal coupling of power and knowledge.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What rights blacks have, or how best to mobilize them, are juridical debates that participate in a larger deception. The very concept of a right presupposes something that blacks historically have never had since the dawn of Western modernity--sovereignty over their own bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Atlantic slave trade was a profound historical rupture, fundamentally degrading the personality of black human beings, all the while obsessing over black flesh.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the very processes employed to produce the body of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*249]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the African slave for consumption and use in the global libidinous system of racial capitalism, slavery bestows visibility on the structure and enormity of what is usually private and incommunicable, contained within the boundaries of the bodies of those who suffer pain. At its base, slavery achieves the conversion of absolute pain into the fiction of absolute power in an obsessive, self-conscious, fetishistic, and parasitic display of agency.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For this reason, the procedures essential to the history of racial slavery and its pernicious afterlife have not been its brutal regime of labor exploitation nor its utility to the advent and maturation of Eurocentric capitalism. Rather, slavery is enabled by, and dependent upon, the most basic of operations: &quot;symbolic and material immobilization, the absolute </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">divestment of sovereignty</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the site of the black body: its freedom of movement, its conditions of labor, its physical and emotional sustenance, its social and sexual reproduction, its political and cultural representation.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The legacy of slavery that continues to impress itself upon our social, psychic, and legal structures into the twenty-first century, bears this imprint of bodily dispossession and aggrandizement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To put it another way, we are working from a definition of slavery that is grounded in an analysis of what the practice signals about the symbolic universe and how physical bodies are constructed in relationship to each other. White supremacy's reliance upon black dehumanization means that enslavement of Africans was never reducible to mere economic logic. White violence against the black body was compelled by a complex mixture of conscious identification, unconscious fears, and subconscious longings.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Loss of one's own body signals capture by direct relations of force. As a captive entity, fixed in an undynamic state, &quot;subject to be mortgaged, according to the rules prescribed by law,&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the slave did not enter into a transaction of value. In this way, slavery was a social death; this is what it means to say that slaves did not exist as human beings.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ethos of slavery that we are pointing to is an economy of desire in which value is produced. However, because value works by mystifying its very processes &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*250]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of determining values, the worth of white and black bodies appears natural, rather than as the result of violent encounters.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The symbolic economy of slavery is more fundamental to its existence than is the political economy. In other words, the constituent elements of slavery begin with desire for the symbols of purity, honor, and humanity represented by whiteness and made possible by blackness and for the pleasure, exoticism, and self-loathing epitomized by blackness as constructed in opposition to whiteness. In addition to the surplus value produced from their labor, the accumulation of black bodies generated a symbolic economy in which slaves were valuable simply for the fact that they existed as things for the satisfaction of the whims of the captor.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is for this reason that the work performed by black slaves is historically significant, but it was not the primary reason for the slaves' (non)being. In the constellation of values that white supremacy establishes, bourgeois democracy mystifies the value of black bodies. As Cornel West puts it:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[White supremacy] dictates the limits of the operation of American democracy--with black folk the indispensable sacrificial lamb vital to its sustenance. Hence black subordination constitutes the necessary condition for the flourishing of American democracy, the tragic prerequisite for America itself. This is, in part, what Richard Wright meant when he noted, &quot;The Negro is America's metaphor.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To state it more pointedly, black death provides the very conditions of possibility for white life.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This point is not hyperbole or melodrama; it is drawn from an analysis of the discursive structure of slavery and the material realities it calls into being. Slave codes in the southern United States demanded that slaves receive clothing, food, and lodging sufficient to their basic needs. Slaves, although dead to rights and responsibilities--civil death--were reduced to nothing but the physical bodies, unprotected against capture, mutilation, and torture.<BR><BR>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*251]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  II.

<P CLASS="c36"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--Jared Sexton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his famed masterpiece </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">The Souls of Black Folks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> W. E. B. Du Bois expresses contempt for the legal vestiges of slavery. He opined that the slave experience caused &quot;[n]egroes . . . to look upon courts as instruments of injustice and oppression, and upon those convicted in them as martyrs and victims.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We need to think through Jena, too, in terms of the manner in which slave codes during the antebellum period constructed a universe of fraudulent morality, which continues to be perpetuated in two ways. First, in asserting the rule of law, white society shrouds the conditions of violent domination behind the myth of consent. The slave is presumed to give his or her consent to being dominated as a consequence of his or her utter powerlessness, or perfect subjugation. Second, slavery has such an extensive legal history precisely because the slave so frequently violated these terms, resisting the absolute authority of white civil society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the discursive order of slavery was preoccupied with how to mark the black body as socially dead and therefore as existing beyond the penumbra of legal rights and responsibilities. Simply put, the law decreed that the black body is a fraud. To be a fraudulent person is to impersonate a human being. There is only one such position in the ontology of the modern Western world and it belongs to the black. The lasting ideological and affective matrix of white supremacy admits no legitimate claims of black self-possession, self-determination, or autonomy in the face of white society's desire to possess, consume, and enjoy the captive body of blacks. This ethos of slavery is far more central to understanding violence against &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*252]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the black body than simply the immiserated conditions (including &quot;disparate treatment&quot; by the state and civil society) that blacks share with other people of color, workers, and the poor generally under global corporate capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of legal decisions demonstrate the violence of this fraudulent ethic. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">State of Missouri v. Celia, a Slave,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Celia was prosecuted for the murder of her owner, who had been raping her regularly in the four years since he purchased her. Celia was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. How could a slave be tried for murder? Is not murder a human act, something requiring agency and a reasoning subjectivity, a mind capable of forming intention and a will to carry out that intent?  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By definition, slavery is the absence of these qualities. The court recognized Celia as human, however, solely in the context of criminal liability: the slave's will was acknowledged only as it was prohibited or punished.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The criminality imputed to Celia disavowed the banal terror of white violence and its instrumentality in state power. The slave woman could neither give nor refuse consent to sex, nor could she offer reasonable resistance to being raped. In the trial record, the history of rape is only obliquely acknowledged as &quot;sexual intercourse.&quot; From the perspective of the law, Celia's body represents the vested interests of others, rather than the vessel of an intrinsic human agency; black criminality was thus a necessary response by the state to this threatening agency of blackness.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous additional cases prove that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Missouri v. Celia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was typical rather than anomalous. More importantly, extensive archival evidence from slave narratives exemplifies the routine terror of sexual and other forms of physical and psychological violence under slavery.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The law, on the other hand, records state terrorism (slavery) in terms that mask the violence necessary for its operation. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Alfred v. State,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alfred, a slave, was sentenced to death for murdering the overseer who raped the slave's wife, Charlotte.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the defense sought to have Charlotte testify on behalf of her husband, the prosecution objected. The court sustained the objection on the grounds that Charlotte's relation to Alfred (that of a wife and her &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*253]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  husband) had no legal status; the denial of marital relation, in turn, negated the violence that had precipitated Alfred's act of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law's repression of state violence transmogrifies Charlotte's rape into mere &quot;adultery&quot; and Alfred's act into &quot;outrages of conjugal affections.&quot; As in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Missouri v. Celia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Alfred</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> court endorses the indiscriminate use of the slave body for pleasure, profit, and punishment. As A. Leon Higginbotham comments, the Missouri court &quot;held that the end of slavery is not merely 'the [economic] profit of the master' but also the joy of the master in the sexual conquest of the slave.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The normativity of rape that derives from the violence of the law is also produced through the law's refusal to recognize any legitimate social relations among the enslaved. Bodily dispossession and its fungibility for white civil society are enabled by constructing the black body as a &quot;genealogical isolate&quot;--a being disconnected from both ancestors and progeny.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slavery achieves this rupture by outlawing African cultural expression; by proscribing parenthood, principally through the separation of children from their &quot;parents&quot;; and through the master's property interest in the female reproductive body.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this way, the slave is bound only to the human realm through property relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The famous North Carolina Supreme Court decision State v. Mann demonstrates how the law simultaneously manifests this fraudulent ethic and represents a significant terrain on which the obvious contradictions are managed. Mann was indicted for assault and battery upon Lydia, a slave whom he had hired for a year from another slave owner, Elizabeth Jones. &quot;During the term, the slave had committed some small offence, for which the Defendant undertook to chastise her--that while in the act of so doing, the slave ran off, whereupon the Defendant called upon her to stop, which being refused, he shot and wounded her.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lower court convicted Mann, finding him guilty of &quot;cruel and unwarrantable punishment, and disproportionate to the offense committed by the slave.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In overturning &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*254]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the conviction, however, the North Carolina Supreme Court emphasized that the slave had</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">no will of his own [and he must surrender] his will in implicit obedience to that of another. Such obedience is the consequence of uncontrolled authority over the body. There is nothing else that can operate to produce the effect. The power of the master must be absolute to render the submission of the slave perfect.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court held that this absolute power was not a matter for legal debate and that the purpose of the slave codes was to convince each slave that &quot;there is no remedy&quot; for injury at the hands of the master.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Mann</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision is significant in many respects. It is certainly noteworthy for the bald language of power it deploys--the supreme authority it reserves for whites and the total surrender it requires from blacks. We suggest, however, that the importance of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Mann</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision lies with the cultural codes of white supremacy that the law draws upon and reaffirms. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Mann</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> court asserted that although the power of the master had to be absolute in order to render the &quot;submission of the slave perfect,&quot; &quot;[a]s a principle of moral right, every person in his retirement must repudiate it. But in the actual condition of things it must be so.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet the harshness of this absolute power would be regulated not by legislative fiat or judicial restraint, but rather by &quot;the private interest of the owner, the benevolence toward each other, seated in the hearts of those who have been born and bred together, the . . . deep execrations of the community upon the barbarian, who is guilty of excessive cruelty to his unprotected slave.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other words, the naked brutality of the law was to be ameliorated by the feelings of benevolence and affection between master and slave. The master was expected, out of the goodness of his heart, to care enough for the enslaved that he would not punish them too harshly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In cultural terms, this legal discourse is profoundly and fatally contradictory. First, the notion that perfect submission--total and utter surrender of bodily sovereignty--is a fundamental ordering principle of the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*255]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  society, to be policed by whatever violent means necessary, means that public order and &quot;harmony&quot; (to use the language of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Mann</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> court) requires systemic state violence. Second, this violence was understood to be regulated through an appeal to the morality of whites, rather than through legal or political bonds. In this way, white civil society preserved a moral self-image on the one hand and established the prerogative for brutal violence on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to fully appreciate the cultural impact of this legal discourse, we should remind ourselves that the unwritten complement of slave law was the decriminalization of white violence that serves as the founding gesture of society. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Commonwealth v. Turner,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Virginia court upheld the master's right to extreme forms of punishment. The only dissenting justice argued that a slave was entitled to protection as a person &quot;except so far as the application of it conflicted with the enjoyment of the slave as a thing.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The coupling of tyranny with affection-- absolute dominion with moral sensibility--established a fraudulent ethic in which the pleasures of parasitism were experienced as morality. As we move our analysis towards the afterlife of slavery, the realm in which we now live, it is worth observing that this form of power becomes both increasingly tenuous and progressively more difficult to dislodge. Whites continue to respond in personal and moral terms to challenges to the status quo; moving into the twenty-first century, assertions of racism and racial inequality are almost impossible to make without being consumed by personal affront or dissipated into an isolated case. Power is effectively insulated by the personal subjectivities of those people (still mostly white but now increasingly other races as well) whose investments it represents and deposits in the social structures of this society.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*256]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  III. JENA AND THE ETHICS OF WHITE SOLIDARITY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The power that centuries of slavery bequeath us is most clearly understood in terms of antiblackness. The Western world structures itself according to an Aristotelian, binary logic of opposition. This binary system of meaning works contextually by always placing any two terms as far from each other as possible; that which supposedly differentiates them constitutes the organizing principle for the schema.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other words, since the Western system works by placing positivity and establishing its self-identity on the value of the white, it structures its primary opposition--negativity--on the level of the black. To speak of racial opposition, then, is to reference an antiblack world in which two principles of value predominate: (1) it is best to be white, and (2) it is worst to be black. Or, to put it in multiracial terms, it is best to be white, but when that fails, at least avoid being black at all costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the vantage of whiteness, this structure of logic is absolute. It is Manichaean (Gnostic) in the sense that it presents the world as comprised of &quot;objective&quot; material good and evil: there are people who are materially good and others who are evil, not by virtue of their behaviors, but because of who or what they are.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This divide does not produce a hierarchy of humanity; instead, it produces a finite schism between the realm of humanity (whites/Europe) and nonhumanity (blacks/Africa). In a Manichaean world, the black can only achieve equality among blacks--a particular and degraded contextuality--while the white finds his or her reference in the universality of humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martinican anticolonialist Frantz Fanon wrote about how the modern world was formed first through sadistic aggression towards blacks (slavery and colonialism), a process which we have elaborated on in the sections above. For Fanon, this sadistic aggression is structural because without it &quot;white would not be white.&quot; But the official sanction against this violence in bourgeois democratic culture turns this structural violence into &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*257]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  impermissible knowledge--the knowledge of the necessity of black death for white life. As we reviewed in the section above, slave law is deeply grounded in the fraudulent ethics of violence and denial. This dual terror--violence and denial--also reveals the double movement that is at the heart of legal discourse in the antiblack world. In the post-Emancipation era, this ethic is reworked in a way that sutures the status of blacks as nonpersons to a rapidly changing legal landscape. We suggest that the appearance of an increasingly liberal terrain with regards to racial violence and the law in fact obfuscates the ongoing reality of antiblackness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formal emancipation of blacks from the social status of chattel was not a reality that whites could comprehend. Consequently, whites reserved a special place in their imaginations for the formerly enslaved subjects.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this way, the dream of slavery lives on at the level of desire and identification, the cultural dimension in which we have said it was most operative all along. Our analysis of slavery emphasized the symbolic economy precisely because it is this ethos that permits identifying slavery's afterlife in the symbols and signs that organize our society in the twenty-first century. In other words, the culture of white supremacy, deeply embedded in the seminal concepts of Western society, means that whiteness remains dependent upon the accumulation of black bodies in new and more complex ways. Two cultural codes took over from slavery: criminality and indebtedness. Both of these figures mark the zone of nonhumanity, demonstrating how, in the post-Emancipation era, the law retrenched antiblackness by simultaneously acknowledging and nullifying black people's new juridical status as free and equal citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment; the adoption of Black Codes; the institutions of convict leasing, sharecropping, and debt peonage; and the widespread practice of lynching together make up the complementary methods of recapturing the black body and suspending it in a state of permanent injury. These methods also represent the material structures of the legal and economic systems that forge the discursive connection &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*258]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between blackness and criminality and form the basis for understanding the contemporary paradigm of policing. The Thirteenth Amendment simultaneously ended slavery in the generalized, formal sense and reconstituted it as the discrete point of reference for continued control over the freed people.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Black Codes racialized specific crimes such that they created crimes for which only black people could be &quot;duly convicted.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, Southern prisons were transformed from largely white to almost exclusively black, clearly marking a historical shift in the method of white domination and punishment of blacks from slavery to imprisonment.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As W.E.B. Du Bois explains in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Black Reconstruction,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> there were no black convicts in the antebellum period since blacks were almost exclusively punished under the discipline of the plantation. After the war, however, the &quot;whole criminal system came to be used as a method of keeping Negroes at work and intimidating them. Consequently there began to be a demand for jails and penitentiaries beyond the natural demand due to the rise of crime.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These penitentiaries quickly swelled with black convicts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This process contributed to the racialization of crime itself, with criminality imputed to blackness. Frederick Douglass claimed that the tendency to &quot;impute crime to color&quot; meant that guilt was assigned to blacks as a group, regardless of the race of the perpetrator of a crime:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In certain parts of our country, when any white man wishes to commit a heinous offence, he wisely resorts to burnt cork and blackens his face and goes forth under the similitude of a Negro. When the deed is done, a little soap and water destroys his identity, and he goes unwhipt of justice. Some Negro is at once suspected and brought before the victim of wrong for identification, and there is never much trouble here, for as in the eyes of many white people, all Negroes look alike, and as the man arrested and who sits in the dock in irons is black, he is undoubtedly the criminal.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglass's point is a simple one: black criminality, like race itself, is premised upon the existence of a racial etiquette, where race becomes a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*259]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;common sense&quot; way of comprehending, explaining, and acting in the world.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over a century after Douglass wrote this analysis of the criminalization of blackness, Katheryn Russell documented case data for sixty-seven racial hoaxes perpetrated between 1987 and 1996, including the notorious cases of Charles Stuart, Susan Smith, and Jesse Anderson.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russell noted that the majority of hoaxes involved whites who fabricated crimes against blacks; moreover, she noted that this data represents but a fraction of all racial hoax cases, since most hoaxes are not classified or reported as such. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">a priori</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> criminalization of blackness is the necessary precursor to incarceration as a central tool of power over the black body. In Douglass's era, it made possible the spread of the convict lease system, in which black prisoners were leased as slaves to private industrialists or planters. As numerous analysts have pointed out, the economic incentive to abuse prisoners, to literally use them up, actually made the experience of convict leasing &quot;worse than slavery.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Black Codes that permitted criminal prosecution of freed people who did not fulfill their job contracts meant that the threat of penal slavery served to enforce the conditions of debt servitude, in which black farmers found themselves trapped during the post-Emancipation period. The prevailing legal and economic systems of the time--leasing, peonage, tenant farming, sharecropping, payment in scrip, racialized criminal law--mutually informed each other, and were determined by the ethos of slavery imbued into the criminal justice system, to produce a totalitarian effort at controlling the black body.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the present time, as in Douglass's day, the criminalization of blackness and the racialization of crime support a policy of mass imprisonment that complements extant changes in the global political economy that deepen, rather than ameliorate, black subjugation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emancipation was thus fatally paradoxical: it brought both a rupture in slavery and a reorganization of the plantation society. The antiblack world reconstructed the former slaves in terms of criminality in part because white society had so ritualistically cleansed its consciousness, via Emancipation, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*260]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the systemic violence on which the society was based. As we discussed in the section above, the fact that, under slavery, the slave's humanity was denied--except for the purpose of criminal liability--points to the role of the law in the construction of antiblackness. As ritualized in one legal moment after another, the privilege to act with impunity is reserved for whites, while blacks are blameworthy for those same actions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this way, the law participated in constructing the larger narrative about slavery as a benevolent institution, emphasizing the dependency and will-less-ness of the slave and the paternalism of the master. As Hartman has demonstrated in her work, within this narrative of the benign institution, the emancipated slave enters freedom beholden to benefactors, the former masters.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Africans were enslaved out of the moral responsibility of Europeans to civilize and protect blacks while benefiting from their labor as &quot;beasts of burden,&quot; then the horrors of slavery and its legacy fall on the shoulders of the freedperson. As solely culpable for the violence of slavery and its aftermath, the freedperson is then cast as indebted to whites for freedom itself. In this way, white supremacy absolves itself of its wrongdoings, thereby producing national innocence for the ongoing crimes of slavery. The freedperson is also held liable by white civil society for the very violence that necessitated the bloody remaking of the nation-state. The renewed forms of violent dispossession and premature death that the freedpersons encountered after Emancipation were thus seen as simply the burdens of freedom, the cross that the former slave must bear.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The specters of criminality and indebtedness thus ensnared blacks in the post-Emancipation era. White supremacy holds the former slave personally responsible for her own victimization, all while the legal and economic institutions that replaced slavery dispossess her of sovereignty and self-determination. This paradoxical process produces the criminal through racially specific social and historical processes--and yet casts her as individually liable. The shame and denigration this experience produces reflects the social devaluation of the criminal; in this context, we can see &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*261]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  how the experience of being socially dishonored and violated can manifest itself in violent behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lynching remains the phenomenon from the Reconstruction era that provides the most paradigmatic illustration of how the phoenix of slavery rose from its legal ashes stronger than ever before. Lynching is the archetype for contemporary techniques of antiblack policing for three primary reasons. First, it provides cohesion for white civil society against the perceived threat of blackness, and enforces allegiance to white supremacy; second, gratuitous violence against black bodies is the language through which this solidarity is achieved; and third, it is the bridge between slavery and the contemporary prison industrial complex in terms of the impunity claimed by the police and white people's prerogative to ignore this antiblack violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We reject the notion that lynching was simply the expression of white civil society and not a form of state terror; the fact that it was not officially organized by the state is merely a technical point made persuasive by the hegemony of the law.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, we have been analyzing the law in terms of actions, not simply what is written in legislative statutes. In this regard, then, the usual description of lynching as &quot;extra-legal,&quot; as in &quot;not regulated or sanctioned by law,&quot; has no purchase in our analysis. To the contrary, lynching was, in keeping with American-style contradictions, simultaneously illegal and legal. Torture, rape, and murder have always been illegal in this country, as have trial, conviction, and execution without due process.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These practices have long been permissible against blacks, of course, but that underscores the point, rather than overrules it: black bodies have always and already been seized, searched, tried, and convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our analysis, lynching is &quot;legal&quot; in two senses. First, it is conducted by whites with impunity, often by law enforcement itself. Second, lynching reveals the &quot;law&quot; of white supremacy governing U.S. society and mandating the bodily dispossession of all blacks in the face of white authority. That lynching was a socially customary practice that ultimately &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*262]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  became legal is most clearly seen in the impunity with which lynch mobs operated; in how law enforcement would aid and abet the actions of the mobs; in the high rates of membership by local and federal law enforcement personnel in the Ku Klux Klan; and in the manner in which lynching was eventually contained (not eliminated). Furthermore, the containment occurred through political pressure by the racial state on local elites who discouraged the practice amongst the white working class that did the heavy lifting of racial terror--</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by means of prosecuting perpetrators or prohibiting the practice through legislative fiat.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the fact that one of the most prominent manifestations of organized black resistance to racial rule during this era took the form of a campaign by black leaders for federal antilynching legislation supports our argument. It is not that the antilynching campaign, led by Ida B. Wells-Barnett and the NAACP, was not historically significant and did not produce important effects, because it achieved both of these things.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather, the point is that black opposition sought redress for injuries that were already simultaneously prohibited and permitted by law by petitioning the racial state for more law. This paradoxical quality to white supremacy was, and remains, essential to its operation. Although murder is illegal, the law permits, and indeed facilitates, white violence against blacks. The need for a specific legal prohibition against lynching simply underscores the degree to which the law does not recognize black humanity.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The historical narrative of lynching as &quot;extra-legal,&quot; however, is most significant for what it tells us about lynching's crucial role in producing white solidarity. White society is rallied today through the amnesiac belief that lynching happened despite the law, not because of it. In this way, the law continues to work to bring white people together at the expense of blacks--in this case, by discursively isolating racism from the domain of law. This move is key to the contemporary culture of white supremacy and is most visible in terms of &quot;color-blindness&quot; ideology, an issue to which we will turn our attention momentarily. Today's public denial of lynching as &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*263]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  state terrorism recalls the ritualism that drove the practice historically. The lynch mob was an extension of the slave patrols central to the slavocracy prior to Emancipation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In writing about the slave patrols, renowned author and progressive activist Steve Martinot provides us with a critical lens through which to discern the meaning of lynching to white people.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[T]he patrols were more than merely a mode of policing. On the one hand, their potential violence as a control mechanism engendered an ethos of impunity that expressed itself as terror in the face of their operations. On the other, they appeared to the white population as the institution of peace and social tranquility. Terror and impunity toward black people constituted the materialization of white solidarity and tranquility, and white consensus in solidarity constituted the product of terror and impunity.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lynching, too, produced social cohesion out of terrorism. The violence generated allegiance to white supremacy by conjuring the specter of social disorder; in so doing it indulged the parasitic fantasies of white society. In this way, lynching was instrumental in reproducing the culture of slavery after its official demise. Lynchings were public rituals that literally created white communal spaces: torture and killing of black people provided one of the few occasions when the class divisions of white society were overcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 1882 and 1946, there were at least five thousand recorded lynchings in the United States, almost one every three days (in February 1893, there was practically one lynching per day).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonetheless, this figure only just begins to embody the violence directed against black communities. White mobs attacked blacks throughout the country during this period, leading to numerous race riots and thousands of deaths.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all cases, this violence against black people has been gratuitous: although the pretexts for this violence varied--fictional black rapists,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> revenge for perceived affronts to white superiority,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n136</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> competition over jobs,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n137</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and suppression of black voting rights,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n138</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to name a few--it was all in response to nothing but black existence.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n139</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the realm of white mob violence, the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*264]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  law as legal discourse and disciplinary practice subtends the symbolic arena; in this regard, lynching teaches us that policing is profoundly psychological, reinforcing the authority of white power.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n140</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In lynching, then, we see the constituent elements of modern policing: impunity, solidarity, terror, and public bodies fungible for white civic pleasure. Since a basic indicator of social parasitism is when one group's pain is another group's pleasure, we should recall the words of Richard Wright and Cornel West, cited earlier: black death provides the very conditions of possibility for white life.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n141</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">IV. CONCLUSION: WHITES ON THE LOOSE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to the Jena case, this combined ethic of parasitism, fraud, and white solidarity--fundamental to white supremacy and deeply engrained in U.S. culture--continues to inform the intrinsic political and psychological structures of this society. In Jena, the hanging of the nooses was widely dismissed by whites as a youthful prank, akin to putting toilet paper on a person's front yard or shaving cream on a car.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n142</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the high school principal wanted to expel the three youth, the school's superintendent reduced their charges on the basis that their prank was nothing more than a tasteless joke. Their reward for such parasitic violence was simple: after three days suspension, they were back at school. Barbara Murphy, a white resident of Jena, expressed the viewpoint of much of the white community that saw no connection between the nooses and racial hatred, nor between racism and the criminal charges against the six black students:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't have a race problem. It's not black against white. It's crime. The nooses? I don't even know why they were there, what they were supposed to mean. There's pranks all the time, of one type or another, going on. And it just didn't seem to be racist to me.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n143</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial violence, of course, is rarely recognized as such by the persecuting society. In the contemporary period, the parasitic relation between white &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*265]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and black, &quot;with black folk the indispensable sacrificial lamb&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n144</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vital for the sustenance of white civil society, is strictly impermissible knowledge.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n145</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This denial on the part of whites is not merely psychological or cultural--it is structural. In the post-civil rights era of formal legal equality, the State's official policy of colorblindness  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n146</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would evaporate as so much hot air were it not for white people, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">en masse,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> disavowing the continued centrality of racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black people in Jena, of course, read the racist violence inherent in the hanging nooses. Robert Bailey, one of the Jena Six, illuminates the parasitism represented by the nooses:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c36"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in the early morning. I seen them hanging. I'm thinking the KKK, you know, were hanging nooses. They want to hang somebody. Real nooses, the ones you see on TV are the kind of nooses they were, the ones they play in the movies and they were hanging all the people, you know, and the thing dropped, those were the kind of nooses they were. I know it was somebody white that hung the nooses in the tree. You know, I don't know another way to put it, but, you know, I was disappointed, because, you know, we do little pranks--you know, toilet paper, that's a prank, you know what I'm saying? Paper all over the square, all the pranks they used to do, that's pranks. Nooses hanging there--nooses ain't no prank.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n147</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caseptla Bailey, Robert's mother, specifically addressed how the violence of the message is connected to actual violence against black bodies:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c36"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It meant hatred, to the other race. It meant that &quot;We're going to kill you, you're going to die.&quot; You know, it sent a message: &quot;This is not the place for you to sit. This is not your damn tree. Do not sit here. You know, you ought to remain in your place, know your place and stay in your place. You're out of your boundaries.&quot; And the first thing now that the sheriff department or that the chief of police want to say that--as well as the superintendent--one had nothing to do with the other. Now, come on now!  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n148</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*266]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Caseptla Bailey so clearly puts it, black bodily dispossession remains a reality today; raw life is still the mark of the age. This pilfering of black sovereignty is literally a source of white entertainment. The June 1998 lynching of James Byrd in Jasper, Texas, by three white men who dragged Byrd from the back of their pickup truck for miles until his head separated from his body, not only underscores in horrific fashion Bailey's assessment of the violence faced by blacks in Jena, but provided the occasion to see white people having fun. Within a week of Byrd's murder, there were reports of copycat crimes: in Louisiana, three white men taunted a black man with racial epithets while trying to drag him alongside their car; in Illinois, three white boys assaulted a black teenager in almost exactly the same way; in New York City three months later, where police officers and firefighters parodied Byrd's lynching by imitating it in a Labor Day parade float; and in Washington, D.C., while Byrd's killers were under trial, a radio announcer responded to a clip from a song by Lauryn Hill by commenting, &quot;No wonder people drag them behind trucks.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n149</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jokes and mimicry surround incidents of racial violence in ways that confound representation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n150</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also shows how the distance of time and space do little to hinder the pedagogy of racial violence from reproducing its lessons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jena Six case itself occasioned its own period of mimicry. In November 2007, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">New York Times</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reported that since the huge September twentieth rally in Jena, where tens of thousands protested racism in the criminal justice system, there have been as many as fifty to sixty &quot;noose incidents.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n151</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That same month, hundreds of people gathered in Charleston, West Virginia, to call for hate-crime charges in the case of Megan Williams, a young black woman who was beaten, tortured, and sexually assaulted for days in a remote trailer by six white people.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n152</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paul Vitello, writing in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">New York Times,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> questioned whether these hate crimes were &quot;part of some new homegrown vernacular of race hate.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n153</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems more likely, however, that incidents such as the Jena Six case (or the murder of James Byrd) give permission to others to express in a more &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*267]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dramatic fashion what is already alive and well at the level of the banal and everyday. We occasion this permitted conduct not to a new form of race hate, as Vitello suggests, but to an extension of a racially ordinary past in legal memory. In other words, what matters is not the new social terrain upon which we confront the racial disposition of the black body today, but instead, the manner in which we have failed to establish a legal system that could remove black punishment from its racial safekeeping. Chester Himes once wrote that &quot;yesterday will make you cry.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n154</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We would add that tomorrow will bring tears as well, since yesterday continues to shape the psychological, social, legal, and political structures of our society. This is one of the many lessons available to us through the Jena Six.</SPAN></P>

There are three elements that received varying emphasis in the conglomeration of Lousiana's assault and battery statutes: (1) the type of weapon used; (2) the seriousness of the injury inflicted; and (3) the specific intent with which the act was done. An assault or battery with intent to commit a specific crime contains all the elements of and necessarily includes an attempt to commit that crime. The only distinction between an assault or battery with specific intent and an attempt is that an offender may be guilty of an attempt where his overt act falls short of constituting a battery, or is even so remote as not to constitute an assault.</SPAN></P>

To put it another way, the majority of the world, for the majority of human history, has developed notions of property that are invested in the collective, or the commons. Western society has been the anomaly in this regard: it alone has conjured the notion of private property. The different conceptions of property ownership are an expression of prevailing individual human relations. We can see this distinction through the differing notions of freedom: western society is unique in claiming the individual &quot;free&quot; when s/he is unfettered by social ties; the rest of the world has regarded this situation as akin to death. Notions of &quot;freedom,&quot; therefore, are socially constructed and thus grounded in particular historical and cultural contexts. The law is merely one instantiation of a particular context. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">See</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> DAVID M. SCHNEIDER,. A CRITIQUE OF THE STUDY OF KINSHIP (Univ. of Mich.

For instance, these differences can be based in language, religion, geography, or family relations. Racism is a specific form of racialism whereby these differences are fatally coupled with power and located in a visual economy, such as skin color, in such a way that it &quot;creates or reproduces structures of domination based on essentialist categories of race.&quot; MICHAEL OMI &amp; HOWARD WINANT, RACIAL FORMATION IN THE UNITED STATES: FROM THE 1960S TO THE 1990S 71 (Routledge 1994). So although racialism within Europe of the Middle Ages is not in this sense racism, any full genealogy of Western racism must attend to the racialist thought deep within European culture. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">See</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> CEDRIC ROBINSON, BLACK MARXISM: THE MAKING OF THE BLACK RADICAL TRADITION (Reed Bus.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><BR><P CLASS="c37"><SPAN CLASS="c31">n75&nbsp; This point is not without debate, including the perspective that white Europeans were subjected to enslavement as much, if not more so, than were Africans. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">See, e.g.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> DON JORDAN &amp; MICHAEL WALSH, WHITE CARGO: THE FORGOTTEN HISTORY OF BRITAIN'S WHITE SLAVES IN AMERICA (N.Y. Univ. Press 2008) (2007). We find this argument unconvincing. For instance, in Jordan and Walsh's book, the authors argue that slavery applies to any person bought and sold, whether for a decade or a lifetime, and therefore the historiography on &quot;indentured servitude&quot; minimizes the severity of white bondage. Although perhaps a useful definition for a comparative study of slavery across time and space </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">(a la</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> Orlando Patterson), this perspective simplifies transatlantic slavery by vacating the noneconomic, or supra-economic, dimensions of trans-Atlantic slavery. In other words, white supremacy's reliance upon the enslaved black body was less about the profit requirements of global capitalism and more about how Western society imagines itself in relation to its racialized Other. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">See,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> FANON, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> note 35; LEWIS GORDON, HER MAJESTY'S OTHER CHILDREN: SKETCHES OF RACISM FROM A NEOCOLONIAL AGE 76 (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers 1997) (explaining and defining &quot;white&quot; reliance upon &quot;black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c33"><SPAN CLASS="c31">The effort to equate the capture and systemic oppression of the working classes in Europe and North America with transatlantic slavery does not do justice to the suffering of white &quot;slaves&quot;--it merely further obfuscates the central role of white supremacy in the long-standing subordination of these working classes. Other scholars attempt a similar argument about the enslavement of white Europeans and Americans in the context of the Mediterranean. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">See e.g.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> WHITE SLAVES, AFRICAN MASTERS: AN ANTHOLOGY OF AMERICAN CAPTIVITY NARRATIVES (Paul Baepler ed., Univ. of Chicago Press 1999); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">see also</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> ROBERT C. DAVIS, CHRISTIAN SLAVES, MUSLIM MASTERS: WHITE SLAVERY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN, THE BARBARY COAST, AND ITALY, 1500-1800 (2004). Davis asserts that during the period 1500-1650 African enslavement of white Christians exceeded the European enslavement of Africans and that marauding Muslim corsairs (pirates) wrought greater destruction and depopulation along the Spanish and Italian coasts than what European slavers would later inflict on the African interior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c33"><SPAN CLASS="c31">Again, although the practices documented by Davis and others certainly occurred, there is a larger context that renders the comparison to transatlantic slavery unsuccessful and unhelpful. For example, Peter Lamborn Wilson's study of the Muslim corsairs from the Barbary Coast points out that thousands of Europeans converted to Islam and joined the pirate &quot;holy war&quot; against the rising bourgeois states of Europe and the persecuting societies of Christiandom, creating &quot;insurrectionary communities.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">See, e.g.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> PETER LAMBORN WILSON, PIRATE UTOPIAS: MOORISH CORSAIRS &amp; EUROPEAN RENEGADOES (Autonomedia 2003).

<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><BR><P CLASS="c37"><SPAN CLASS="c31">n108&nbsp; Perhaps the most prominent illustration of this phenomenon is the white reaction against affirmative action. Although affirmative action is a complex issue that warrants more thorough treatment than we can provide here, we can briefly point to some of the ways that whites articulate their political resistance to the policy in personal terms. For instance, the frequently evoked sentiment that a &quot;less qualified&quot; black candidate received the position over a &quot;more deserving&quot; white candidate is essentially whites internalizing, and simultaneously insulating themselves from, the structural reality of institutional racism. They internalize it in the sense that they take the current arrangement of resources to be the outcome of something inside of them, reflective of their characters and their merits as individuals, rather than the outcome of white privilege. In so doing, they are distancing themselves psychologically from the ongoing reality of historical inequities. As a result, the offense they experience when they perceive that they have been passed over by a &quot;less qualified&quot; black candidate is fundamentally racist in its meaning, but equally impossible for them to see as such.</SPAN></P>

Although it is beyond the scope of this article, it should be noted here that the origins of black bodily dispossession in the contemporary period lies with the fundamental alienation from labor and land solidified through the post-Emancipation legal regime. As Jeff Kerr-Ritchie points out, the freedpeople were very clear as to what they wanted their relationship to the land to become after slavery. The sentiments of freedpeople from the Georgia Sea Islands in testimony to Congress in 1865: &quot;Cotton is no good for nigger. Corn good for nigger; ground nuts good for nigger; cotton good for massa; if massa want cotton he may make it himself, cotton do nigger no good; cotton make nigger perish.&quot; Kerr-Ritchie reminds us that former slaves throughout the diaspora exhibited a profound distaste for cash crop production: in independent Haiti and British Jamaica, freedpeople had sought subsistence over cash crop economies, with many former slaves becoming small peasant farmers as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c33"><SPAN CLASS="c31">It was this orientation that made the freedpeople a major obstacle to restoring the cotton economy after the Civil War, and directly contributed to them not receiving the promised forty acres and a mule. The loss of the land, in other words, is an extension of the loss of sovereignty over oneself; this dispossession is refracted in the law, which made it possible for whites to become the major beneficiaries of the &quot;forty acres and a mule&quot; supposedly intended for the former slaves. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">See</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> Jeffrey Kerr-Ritchie, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">Forty Acres, or, An Act of Bad Faith,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> THE NEW BLACK RENAISSANCE: THE SOULS ANTHOLOGY OF CRITICAL AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES 25-39 (Manning Marable et al., eds., Paradign Publishers 2005).</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><BR><P CLASS="c37"><SPAN CLASS="c31">n123&nbsp; Perhaps the best modern example of the black-white disparity in criminal blameworthiness resides in the ongoing debate centered on the disparity in crack versus powder cocaine sentencing. Although different forms of the same drug, crack and powder cocaine, have the same effects on the brain and nervous system. Federal law, however, sets a one hundred to one sentencing disparity between the two forms. This means that the distrubution of just five grams of crack cocaine (a thimble full) yields a five-year mandatory minimum, while it takes five hundred grams of powder cocaine to trigger the same five-year sentence. The sentencing disparity, enacted in 1986 at the height of drug war hysteria, was based largely on the myth that crack cocaine was more dangerous than powder cocaine and that it was instantly addictive and caused violent behavior, a distinction now disproven by copious amounts of scientific evidence. The impact of this disparity on black-white blameworthiness is devastating. For example, in 2006, 82 percent of those sentenced under federal crack cocaine laws were black, and only 8.8 percent were white--even though more than two-thirds of people who use crack are white. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">See</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> U.S. SENTENCING COMM'N, SPECIAL REPORT TO CONGRESS: COCAINE AND FEDERAL SENTENCING POLICY 16 (2007); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">see also</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> Bob Paynter, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">If You're Arrested for Drugs, You're More Likely to Receive a Second Chance if You're White,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> THE CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER REPORTER, Oct. 19, 2008, http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2008/10/race_and_drug_use.html (providing an excellent example of the impact of this disparity).</SPAN></P>

Buttigieg ed., Columbia Univ. Press 1992) (1972). We should elaborate on our use of the concept &quot;hegemony&quot; in the context of the Jena 6. The Italian Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci is often referenced by analysts seeking to explain the nature of political struggle in a bourgeois democracy such as the United States. The Left persistently seeks guidance from Gramsci's study of &quot;hegemony&quot; to explain how state/capital formations are insulated from contestation by the institutions of civil society (e.g., schools, media, churches, social services, entertainment) that appear to spontaneously perform the bidding of the ruling class. According to Gramsci's notion of hegemony, what appears to be spontaneous is in fact a product of political struggle in which consent is manufactured by intellectuals of the ruling class, backed up by &quot;coercion-in-reserve.&quot; In this vein, the law is a key instrument in the winning of consent: the production of &quot;common sense&quot; about the law--for example, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">that it exists as the last barrier against chaos, and as such, represents everyone's interests</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31">--is a primary means by which civil society participates in its own subordination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c33"><SPAN CLASS="c31">Unfortunately, Gramsci's insights are limited in their applicability to a social context predicated on slavery. As Frank Wilderson explains, Gramsci's assumptive logic posits &quot;that all subjects are positioned in such a way as to have their consent solicited and to, furthermore, be able to extend their consent 'spontaneously,&quot; Wilderson, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> note 27, at 5. In a slave society, and one such as ours based in slavery's ongoing relations of force, there is no valency of position for blacks and whites. While whites may have their consent solicited in various ways by the institutions of state, capital, and civil society, with coercion only as a contingency, a reverse process has applied to blacks. Direct relations of force, both state violence and the deregulated violence of white civil society, have always preceded the manufacturing of consent when it comes to blacks. In other words, hegemony is not a useful concept for explaining the black experience. So when we observe above that the popular belief that lynching was not a form of state-sanctioned terror is only sustained by the hegemony of the law, we are referring to law's hegemonic relationship to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">white</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> civil society. We make this argument in the context of our discussion in Section II, where we sought to situate the central tropes of western legal discourse (freedom, the individual, and private property), showing that historical development of these concepts occurred </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">through</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> the capture of black people, and that within the U.S. legal tradition, the rule of law developed through the myth of consent.</SPAN></P>

His mother, Mamie Till Bradley, insisted on an open-casket funeral so that the entire world would see the brutality of white supremacy. This moment is often credited with galvanizing the modern civil rights movement. Rushdy points out that no photographs of Byrd's murdered body have ever been made public; he argues that hiding the violent handiwork of white supremacy enables the majority of white Americans to continue believing that racism was a phenomenon that ended sometime in the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
