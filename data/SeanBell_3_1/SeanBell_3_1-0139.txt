BY now, with all the talk of outrage over the 
 verdict, you would think the jails would be filled with protesters, traffic would be tied up in every direction and the judge who acquitted the defendant shooters would at least be hanged in effigy.   
But as the sun rose over a peaceful city yesterday, a day after deep disappointment for many, New York was no more on edge than it was when the Giants won the Super Bowl.       
Community leaders promised peace - and delivered. But even that wasn't necessary to curtail an explosion. There was never any powder in the keg.  
A riot, like the one that hit Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict, needs a little time to build. Tensions simply don't exist the way they did when Rudy Giuliani was mayor.       
It was no surprise - not even to Bell's most ardent supporters - that Judge Arthur Cooperman would acquit the cops who killed Bell on Nov. 25, 2006, when they fired 50 shots at Bell's car.       
Most cynics - that is, most of the black community - knew what the verdict would be before the first witness was called.       
Had the expectations been higher, the outrage would have certainly been greater, although most of us are grateful that the city is not engulfed in flames.  
But we expected nothing, and got even less.  
The Rev. Al Sharpton, an adviser to Bell's family and friends, vowed yesterday to "shut the city down" in protest, but he didn't say when.   
That's like striking while the iron is cooling off and being placed on a shelf in the closet.
