<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bitter as the verdict was to many New Yorkers, the acquittal of three NYPD detectives in the killing of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a fair exercise in the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman drew on evidence adduced at the eight-week trial to render his not-guilty verdict in favor of Detectives Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was enough in the record to support sparing the cops criminal responsibility for Bell's death in a 50-shot barrage. But the officers must still be held to account for grievous failures in judgment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceedings must begin to dismiss Oliver, Isnora and Cooper from the NYPD, along with the supervisors who let the detectives' undercover operation run amok with fatal consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial proved to be a clarifying, maddening, heartbreaking exposition of the events on the night that Bell died and two of his friends were wounded. As laid out skillfully by the Queens district attorney, the story is, at its core, a tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, went to a strip club for an impromptu bachelor party the night before his wedding. The cops were undercover in the club as part of a drive against quality-of-life offenses, such as prostitution and drug sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one set out to commit a crime that night. No one set out to shoot anyone. But then the cops picked up signs that someone in the club was armed with a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, according to testimony, there was a confrontation between Bell's group and a man on the street who gave the impression he had a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, according to testimony, one of Bell's friends said he was going to get a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Bell's group walked around the corner to his car. The cops followed. Possibly believing he faced attack by a dangerous civilian, Bell attempted to drive away. The car struck Isnora. Isnora opened fire, followed by Oliver, Cooper and other cops who weren't indicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are permitted to shoot when they reasonably believe their lives are in danger. Under the law, the DA had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Oliver, Isnora and Cooper had no good cause to believe they were mortally threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a very high standard for a prosecutor to meet - and an impossible one here because the cops had heard talk of an illegal gun. That the talk was wrong only deepens the pain inflicted on Bell's fianc&eacute;e and family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, too, the facts that Isnora fired 11 shots and Oliver let loose 31 times, stopping to reload. But it was all over, Cooperman concluded, in &quot;just seconds.&quot; He declined to judge the cops criminally reckless for unleashing the fusillade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the closest of calls. Another judge, or perhaps a jury, might have found otherwise. Just as other cops might have had more control, might have been more aware that Bell and his friends could respond to them as attackers, might have approached with lights and sirens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what others might have done is not the point in a manslaughter trial. As Cooperman said, simple incompetence is not criminal even when deadly. It is, however, grounds for getting the boot. Which is why Oliver, Isnora and Cooper must go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They killed an unarmed man. They brought irreparable loss to his family. They tore the social fabric. They damaged race relations, regardless of the fact that one is black, one half-black and one Hispanic. And they cast the NYPD into the worst possible light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is anger now. It is understandable, and it will be voiced in protest. Let it be heard in the hope, as expressed by Mayor Bloomberg and Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre Bell, that such a debacle in which there are only losers never happens again.</SPAN></P>
