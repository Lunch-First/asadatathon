<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOMENTS AFTER an unarmed black teenager was killed by a suburban St. Louis cop, a county police dispatcher reported an urgent request from an officer in trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Need assistance with crowd control,&quot; the dispatcher said on recordings of radio chatter from Saturday - the day 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A short time time later, the dispatcher reported an &quot;officer-involved shooting&quot; in Ferguson, Mo., but added, &quot;Be advised. This information came from the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We called Ferguson back again and they don't know anything about it,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty minutes later, it was all hands on deck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attention, all cars. Be advised we are switching over to the riot channel,&quot; the dispatcher said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apparent confusion was revealed in recordings obtained and posted on the Web Wednesday by Anonymous, a hacker collective that has launched &quot;Operation Ferguson&quot; to make sure that Brown's death is investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also trying to unmask the officer who fired the fatal shots. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson has refused to identify the cop because of threats against his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tapes were unveiled on the same day that Brown's pal Dorian Johnson, who claims the teen was &quot;shot like an animal,&quot; finally met with police and FBI investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His lawyer, former St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley, said he tried to arrange a meeting with police after the killing but was rebuffed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St. Louis County police, insisted they tried several times to talk to Johnson but could not find him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brown killing has stoked racial tensions in a mostly African-American suburb where there is deep resentment against a 53-person police force that has just three black officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite repeated calls for calm from people including President Obama, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Brown's family, Ferguson has been rocked by three straight nights of disturbances and looting.</SPAN></P>
