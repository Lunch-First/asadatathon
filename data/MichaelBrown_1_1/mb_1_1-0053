<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 15--ELKHART -- A candlelight vigil for the violence in Ferguson, Mo., will be at 8 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 14, at the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Elkhart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot do nothing as our neighbors in Missouri experience what happens in a police state,&quot; the church posted on Facebook on Thursday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vigil will be led the Rev. Amy Kulesza DeBeck in the church sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests have been ongoing in the St. Louis suburb since Saturday, Aug. 9, when a white police officer shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, to death, the Associated Press reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tension and violence came to a head Wednesday night, with some protesters throwing Molotov cocktails and other objects at police, who retaliated with smoke bombs, tear gas, pepperballs, rubber bullets and stun grenades, MSNBC reports.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a statement on the events Thursday afternoon, President Barack Obama criticized both sides involved in the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,&quot; he said. &quot;There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also criticized police for the arrests of journalists &quot;who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
