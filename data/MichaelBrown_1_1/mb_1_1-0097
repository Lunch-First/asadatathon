<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vigils have been held across the country for people who died at the  hands of police.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    People in more than 90 cities observed Thursday's National Moment  of Silence. The vigils came in the wake of the shooting death of an  18-year-old man by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., and the death  of a New York City man caused by a police officer's chokehold.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rallies also were scheduled for the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, near  where Michael Brown was shot, and in Detroit and Los Angeles.  People were asked to wear a red ribbon, cloth or bandanna in a show  of solidarity.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Hackensack native Yemisi Miller-Tonnet was one of several leaders  of the moment-of-silence event in Washington, D.C.,  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;Having just four people show up to an event like this is just as  productive [as] having ...2,000 people,&quot; said Miller-Tonnet, 19.  &quot;It's still just as powerful as long as we don't return home after  the moment of silence and do nothing else about it. We have to go  further with it.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In North Jersey, The Gardens at Wyckoff on Crescent Avenue was the  spot for a sparsely attended event.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I live near here - you gotta start where you are,&quot; said Kenneth  Joseph of Mahwah. &quot;People in this area are not typically affected  by police brutality -- they may not know what it means to think  that you're not going to be able to see your son off to college but  instead you are planning his funeral.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In New York, about a thousand people marched peacefully in  Manhattan's Union Square.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In Nevada, about 40 people gathered outside the federal courthouse  in Reno.</SPAN></P>
