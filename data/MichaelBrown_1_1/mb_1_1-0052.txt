Aug. 15--The Rev. Amy DeBeck held a vigil Thursday evening, Aug. 14, at the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Elkhart to reflect on the events in Ferguson, Mo. DeBeck spoke about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager killed by police and the days of police response and arrests of journalists that have followed. Some congregants reflected on how current events remind them of the 1960s and the protests and police actions they lived through. 
DeBeck gave participants a chance to voice their thoughts, then offered a prayer for the families, officers and citizens of Ferguson, as congregants lit candles for their vigil.
"For all of this fear, may there be a candle somewhere that rekindles the warmth and love in their hearts, and reminds them that love is stronger than fear," she offered.
