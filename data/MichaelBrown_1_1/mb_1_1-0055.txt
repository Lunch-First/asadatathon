MISSOURI police have arrested two journalists reporting on the unrest that has roiled a US suburb after an unarmed black teenager was shot dead by police, the duo say. 
Aspiring college student Michael Brown, 18, died on Saturday in a police shooting in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson, sparking rioting and stirring comparisons to the February 2012 fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin.
Wesley Lowery, a Washington Post political reporter, and Ryan Reilly, a Huffington Post reporter, were arrested in a McDonald's after police entered the restaurant and ordered people to leave, the pair wrote on Twitter.
In a series of tweets, Lowery said they were given no explanation for their arrest other than "trespassing" and were not charged with any offences before being released.
Earlier on Wednesday in Ferguson, police fired several shots at a 19-year-old who pointed a handgun in their direction as they dispersed around 30 people who had gathered near where the rioting had occurred, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch.
The young man was taken to hospital, his name has not been released.
Officials urged demonstrators to remain calm, but there were reports on Wednesday of more protests.
