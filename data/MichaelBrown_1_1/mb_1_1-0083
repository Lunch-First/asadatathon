<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators in Ferguson, Mo. gathered on Wednesday for another round of protests over the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager who was killed over the weekend by a police officer. Mr. Brown's death has triggered days of protests that have brought national attention to racial tension between the police and the African-American community in the St. Louis suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters showed up in droves, marching along the streets near where Mr. Brown was gunned down and staying well into the night. They were met by heavily armed riot police and SWAT teams in armored cars in scenes that were captured in photos and videos on social media with hashtags like #MikeBrown and #Ferguson. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a nighttime protest that was streamed live online, protesters could be heard chanting ''We ain't leaving until we have justice.'' A line of police officers appeared to move closer to the crowd and fire what appeared to be rubber bullets and tear gas canisters, then set off sound cannons. A man narrating the video said the protest was peaceful and the attack was unprovoked. (Warning: the video contains strong language.)</SPAN></P>
