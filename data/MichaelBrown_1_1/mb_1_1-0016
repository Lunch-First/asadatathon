<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the message the Rev. Al Sharpton delivered Tuesday in St. Louis, where he spoke three days after a police officer fatally shot unarmed black teen Michael Brown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The local authorities have put themselves in a position - hiding names and not being transparent - where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation,&quot; Sharpton said, joined by Brown's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton also echoed pleas for peaceful protests by the NAACP and the 18-year-old Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., who told the crowd: &quot;I need all of us to come together and do this right. . . . No violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama said people must comfort each other &quot;in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ferguson, Mo., police chief opted Tuesday not to release the officer's name after the department was deluged with death threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we come out and say, 'It was this officer,' then he immediately becomes a target,&quot; said Chief Tom Jackson (inset). The six-year veteran is now on paid administrative leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief spoke out after Ferguson was rocked by another night of violent protests - and after some 100 demonstrators marched on the St. Louis County courthouse Tuesday chanting, &quot;Hands up! Don't shoot!&quot; Witnesses have said Brown was holding his hands up in surrender when he was shot.&quot;He was executed in broad daylight,&quot; said Brown family lawyer Benjamin Crump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI has launched a civil rights investigation. Brown pal Dorian Johnson said the two were walking in the street when the cop pulled up to them and barked, &quot;Get the f--- on the sidewalk!&quot;Police initially said the officer fired when one of the teens pushed him into his cruiser and went for his gun.</SPAN></P>
