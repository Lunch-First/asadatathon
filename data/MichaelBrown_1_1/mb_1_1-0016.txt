NAME the cop.
That's the message the Rev. Al Sharpton delivered Tuesday in St. Louis, where he spoke three days after a police officer fatally shot unarmed black teen Michael Brown. 
"The local authorities have put themselves in a position - hiding names and not being transparent - where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation," Sharpton said, joined by Brown's parents.
Sharpton also echoed pleas for peaceful protests by the NAACP and the 18-year-old Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., who told the crowd: "I need all of us to come together and do this right. . . . No violence."
President Obama said people must comfort each other "in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds."
The Ferguson, Mo., police chief opted Tuesday not to release the officer's name after the department was deluged with death threats.
"If we come out and say, 'It was this officer,' then he immediately becomes a target," said Chief Tom Jackson (inset). The six-year veteran is now on paid administrative leave.
The chief spoke out after Ferguson was rocked by another night of violent protests - and after some 100 demonstrators marched on the St. Louis County courthouse Tuesday chanting, "Hands up! Don't shoot!" Witnesses have said Brown was holding his hands up in surrender when he was shot."He was executed in broad daylight," said Brown family lawyer Benjamin Crump.
The FBI has launched a civil rights investigation. Brown pal Dorian Johnson said the two were walking in the street when the cop pulled up to them and barked, "Get the f--- on the sidewalk!"Police initially said the officer fired when one of the teens pushed him into his cruiser and went for his gun.
