<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have deployed camouflage-clad officers in body armor, including one manning a rifle on a tripod atop an armored car, to Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've had enough of being pushed around because of the color of my skin. I'm sick of this police brutality,&quot; said one protester, who gave only his first name, Terrell, 18. &quot;I'm going to keep coming back here night after night until we get justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A St. Louis alderman, Antonio French, was among some 10 people arrested on Wednesday evening, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper reported. About 40 protesters have been arrested since Saturday.</SPAN></P>
