THE FBI has opened an investigation into the death of an unarmed African-American teen who was shot and killed by a St. Louis area cop over the weekend, police said Monday. 
Michael Brown, 18, was in retreat with his arms raised when he was fatally shot during a confrontation with a white cop in a suburban street Saturday, witnesses said.
"He had his hands up in the air and the officer continued shooting - which is an execution," charged the victim's grandfather, Leslie McSpadden.
Brown's relatives were speaking on MSNBC with the Rev. Al Sharpton, who plans on traveling to their home in Ferguson, Mo., Tuesday.
"They demand justice," family lawyer Benjamin Crump said. "He was running away."
Crowds gathered in Ferguson the night after the shooting at what was supposed to be a peaceful candlelight vigil - but it turned into a night of looting and mayhem, which his family quickly denounced.
"We are not for this," Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said on Sharpton's program. "The violence needs to stop."
People looted a convenience store, a check-cashing store and a boutique, among other businesses.
There were scattered reports of gunshots throughout the night.
The officer in Brown's shooting, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and was placed on administrative leave, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said.
"It is our understanding at this point in the investigation, that within the police car, there was a struggle over the officer's weapon," he said at a press conference.
But Phillip Walker, who said he watched the incident from his porch, told The Associated Press that Brown "was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued."
Brown's family lawyer said the victim - who was set to start college this week - was shot up to eight times. He accused the cop of leaving the dying teenager on the roadway and taking off without summoning medical help.
