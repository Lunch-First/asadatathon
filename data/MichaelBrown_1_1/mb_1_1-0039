Photo: Reuters St Louis residents and police clash over death By Nick O'Malley in Washington Five days after a police officer shot 18-year-old Michael Brown dead in St Louis, police have yet to cast any light on the killing or even name the officer who pulled the trigger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the official silence more witnesses have come forward to corroborate the grim story first told by the young man Mr Brown was with when he died, 22-year-old Dorian Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr Johnson, the two young men were walking along a street in the suburb of Ferguson, a small community with its own police force, when officers in a pick-up truck rolled past and ordered them to &quot;get the f--- on the sidewalk&quot;. Mr Johnson says the officer leaned out of the window and grabbed Mr Brown around the neck. The two wrestled, a gun discharged and the boys ran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police confirm that Mr Brown's body fell 10 metres from the truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Johnson says Mr Brown was hit once, turned and raised his hands only to be shot several more times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday Tiffany Mitchell, who was driving past as the incident happened, appeared on CNN with her lawyer and said that she observed Mr Brown trying to pull away from the officer as they grappled through the window before running down the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As he runs the police gets out of his vehicle and he follows behind him shooting and the kid's body jerked as if he was hit from behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he turned around and he puts his hands up ... and the cop continues to fire until he dropped down to the ground and his face just smacks into the concrete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each night since Saturday crowds have gathered and police have responded with arrests, tear-gas and rubber bullets. On Wednesday night the nation was shocked by images of police SWAT teams training weapons on peaceful protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many believe that the police response to the shooting has provoked the continuing tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say Mr Brown's body was left in the street for four hours after he died and no ambulance was called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Mitchell told CNN that when his grieving family arrived they were given no details about what had happened. When she tried to tell them what she saw, police sought to prevent her, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday US President Barack Obama addressed the tensions, offering condolences to Mr Brown's family and calling on the community to &quot;comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is impossible to exaggerate how seriously the US takes the spectre of race riots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In The New York Times on Thursday, columnist Charles Blow wrote: &quot;There is an eerie echo in it all - a sense of tragedy too often repeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet the sheer morbid, wrenching rhythm of it belies a larger phenomenon ... &quot;The criminalisation of black and brown bodies - particularly male ones - from the moment they are first introduced to the institutions and power structures with which they must interact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
