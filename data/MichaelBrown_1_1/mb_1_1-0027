<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman whose grandson was fatally shot by police said she found his body in the middle of the street minutes after he was expected to arrive at her home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desiree Harris told the Associated Press that she was driving through her suburban St. Louis neighborhood in the afternoon when she saw her 18-year-old grandson, Michael Brown, running a few blocks from her house. After she arrived home minutes later, she heard a commotion and ran outside to see Brown's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of angry residents gathered for hours after the incident, shouting and cursing at police. A spokesman with the St. Louis County Police Department confirmed that a Ferguson police officer had shot Brown. The spokesman didn't give a reason for the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Gaskin of the St. Louis County NAACP called on the FBI to assist in the investigation. &quot;With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African American young men that have been killed by police officers ... this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
