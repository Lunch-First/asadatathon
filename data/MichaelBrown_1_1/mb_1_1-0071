<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEAVILY armed police fired tear gas, stun grenades and smoke bombs as America's worst race riots for more than a decade re-ignited for a fourth consecutive night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rioters - on the streets after a police officer shot dead an unarmed black teenager - replied with rocks, petrol bombs and chants of 'Hands up, don't shoot'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man identified on Twitter as the officer behind the shooting in Missouri was last night in hiding - though it later emerged that hackers had named the wrong man. President Obama has asked to be briefed on the clashes in Ferguson, a suburb about 20km north of the city of St Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence follows the death of black teenager Michael Brown last Saturday. Friends claim he had his arms in the air when he was shot several times during an arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, officials in Ferguson said the 18-year-old was involved in struggle for a police gun and the officer who fired the fatal shots was wounded in the face in the scuffle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gangs of youths in the suburb took to the streets and so far more than 20 shops have been looted and dozens of arrests made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family of the victim demanded an inquiry into the shooting but also appealed for calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses say that largely peaceful demonstrations during daylight hours have turned into rioting as the police try to enforce an evening curfew by blocking roads with armoured vehicles. Police are also accused of heavy-handed tactics. Soon after Brown's shooting they began using dogs for crowd control - a tactic that for some was a reminder of civil rights protests a half-century ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County police chief Jon Belmar insisted his officers have responded with 'an incredible amount of restraint', because they have been the targets of rocks, bottles and gunshots, with 24 patrol vehicles being destroyed.</SPAN></P>
