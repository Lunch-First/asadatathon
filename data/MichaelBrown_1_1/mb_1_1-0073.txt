Barack OBAMA yesterday appealed for 'peace and calm' on the streets of a St LouIs suburb BESIEGED by vIolent clashes between POLICE and protesters FOLLOWING the POLICE SHOOTING of a teenager. 
'I know EMOTIONs are raw rIght now In Ferguson and there are CERTAINLY PASSIONATE dIfferences about what has happened,' Mr Obama SAID about the tense stand-off In the MIssourI suburb. 'But let's remember that we're all part of one AMERICAN FAMILY, we are UNITED In common values and that Includes the BELIEF In EQUALITY under the law, respect for PUBLIC order and the rIght to peaceful PUBLIC protests.' Mr Obama SAID there was no excuse for EXCESSIVE force by POLICE In the aftermath of Saturday's SHOOTING of unarmed 18-year-old MICHAEL Brown.
