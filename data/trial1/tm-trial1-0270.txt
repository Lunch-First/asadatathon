THOUSANDS have protested in US cities as President Barack Obama appealed for calm over the acquittal of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager. 
The angry protests highlight simmering racial tensions after a jury found volunteer watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.
Demonstrators held noisy rallies in US cities including New York, San Francisco, Boston, Detroit and Chicago.
Six people were arrested in Los Angeles when riot police broke up an ``unlawful assembly'' in Hollywood.
To the chants of ``No justice, no peace!'' a separate crowd blocked traffic on an important freeway elsewhere in the city.
The biggest rally on Sunday was in New York City where several thousand people -- including families with children -- marched to Times Square under the watchful eye of police.
Many in the multiracial crowd brandished signs bearing a portrait of Mr Martin, while some, despite sweltering heat, wore ``hoodie'' sweatshirts as the teen did the night he was killed.
Mr Obama, the first black US president, urged Americans to step back and accept the trial verdict.
``We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,'' the President said.
``I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.''
Mr Zimmerman was accused of pursuing Mr Martin through a gated community in Sanford, Florida, and shooting him during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, 2012.
``I am appalled,'' Carli VanVoorhis, a 21-year-old hairdresser, said.
``The man was armed, the kid was not, and the man with the gun got away,'' she said.
