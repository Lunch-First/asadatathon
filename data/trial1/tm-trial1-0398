<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 16--Pocono residents upset with George Zimmerman's acquittal are planning a peaceful vigil for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on Saturday in East Stroudsburg. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we really want to do is have the community come together. I know people have different opinions, but we want people who have different opinions to come together,&quot; said Cassie Tucker, who is organizing the vigil with her friend Akila Hayden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We just thought that justice wasn't served and instead of doing it violently by protesting, we wanted to do something that would bring peace to the whole community,&quot; Hayden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vigil will be held at 7 p.m. Saturday in front of the Bargain Book Warehouse across from Wal-Mart in East Stroudsburg and will include a balloon release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event is being called Justus (Justice) for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Balloon Release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The name of the event is a play on words, &quot;like 'just us' coming together,&quot; Tucker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hayden's sister, the Rev. Romanay Maureen Lashley of The Upper Room Anointed Word Ministry in Tobyhanna, will also say a few words at the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think my focal point will be to promote as much peace and prayer as possible,&quot; Lashley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's important for Trayvon's family, which is why I said peace and prayer -- keeping his family in our prayers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more information, contact Hayden at 570-369-7177 or Tucker at 570-369-8188.</SPAN></P>
