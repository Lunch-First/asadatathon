George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, was found not guilty of second-degree murder or manslaughter for shooting and killing black teenager TrayvonMartin. The decision by the all-female, six-person jury came more than a year after the incident, which triggered a strong response and led to a national dialogue on race and "Stand Your Ground" laws.

* Zimmerman calls 911 to report Martin, and the police dispatcher tells him there was no need to follow the Martin youth.
* Zimmerman follows Martin, and a fight ensues.
* Neighbors called 911 after hearing an altercation and a gunshot, and Zimmerman was taken into custody but was not arrested because he claimed self-defense.

Excluded evidence
* Text messages taken from Martin's phone and an animation purporting to show the fight cannot be used. However, the Defense could use the animation as a demonstrative exhibit in their closings.
* Testimony from two audio experts for the prosecution about audio recording of a 911 call are excluded.

* Judge Nelson tossed out Florida police detective Chris Serino's statement that he found Mr. Zimmerman credible in his description of fighting with Martin.
Evidence for Zimmerman
* The defense showed photos of Zimmerman's bruised head and face, which were taken after his fight with Martin.
* John Good, who lived at the housing complex where Martin was killed, testified he saw someone in dark clothes straddling someone wearing white or red who was lying on the ground. (Zimmerman was wearing a red jacket that night.) The person on top, he said, used repeated arm motions moving downward.
* Public safety consultant Dennis Root testified that Martin was in better shape than Zimmerman.
* Forensics expert Vincent DiMaio testified that the trajectory of the bullet and gun powder on Martin's body support Zimmerman's account that Martin was on top of him when he fatally shot the teenager.
* Florida's "Stand Your Ground" law, passed in 2005, allows Zimmerman to defend himself and meet force with force (including deadly force) if he felt it was necessary to prevent bodily harm, death or an imminent felony.
* Anthony Gorgone, a crime lab analyst with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, testified that he found no traces of Zimmerman's DNA in scrapings taken from Martin's fingernails.
Evidence against Zimmerman
* Zimmerman used a 9 mm handgun to kill Martin, and the prosecution questioned why a volunteer would carry a weapon.
* Zimmerman did not have to put himself in the situation he did, as a 911 dispatcher told him there was no need to follow Martin.
* Rachel Jeantel, 19, a friend of Martin's, spoke on the phone with Martin moments before he was killed and told the jury that Martin said he was being followed and tried to get away from the man pursuing him.
* Florida Department of Law Enforcement analyst and firearms expert Amy Siewert testified that tearing and residue on Martin's clothing showed the gun was positioned directly against him when it fired.
* Prosecutors said Zimmerman profiled Martin because of appearance.
* Prosecutors questioned how Zimmerman's skull have hit concrete 25 times, as he said, and sustained so few injuries and how Martin could have grabbed the gun and not left any DNA.
Trial points
* The Florida Supreme Court defines reasonable doubt as not merely possible doubt, speculative, imaginary or forced doubt. Jurors are told that if ? after carefully considering, comparing and weighing all the evidence, they do not have a stable, unwavering conviction of guilt, then the charge is not proved beyond every reasonable doubt and they must find the defendant not guilty because the doubt is reasonable.
* Under the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guaranteed trial by a 12-member jury until the 1970 case Williams v. Florida, when it was decided that the Constitution did not require 12 jurors. Additionally, a Florida statute says "twelve persons shall constitute a jury to try all capital cases, and six persons shall constitute a jury to try all other criminal cases."
Aftermath
* July 14, 2013: Protests planned in Boston, Detroit, Baltimore, San Francisco and other cities. At least one protest in California hours after the verdict late Saturday ended with vandalism.
President Barack Obama called the death of Martin a tragedy for the country and urged calm reflection, a message shared by religious and civil rights leaders hoping to ensure peaceful demonstrations in the wake of a case that became an emotional flash point.
Two rallies in Pittsburgh merged at the Hill Distict's Freedom Corner to speak out against the verdict, culminating with a sit-in that blocked Centre Avenue.
