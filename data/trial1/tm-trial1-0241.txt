ANNAPOLIS - The Annapolis Democratic Action Committee and The Concerned Citizens of Annapolis will hold a march and a rally in Annapolis Tuesday night to protest the verdict in the George Zimmerman case.
Eye on Annapolis reported Tuesday morning the march will begin at 6 p.m. at the Alex Haley Memorial at City Dock, and will head to the Thurgood Marshall Memorial at Lawyers Mall off College Avenue.
Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., was acquitted of all charges Saturday in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager.
Martin's death touched off a national debate on race relations and equal justice.
The Annapolis Democratic Action Committee is also using the Zimmerman verdict to encourage people to vote. Members will be providing voter registration forms all summer long at the Harbour House swimming pool in Annapolis.
