<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevie Wonder says he won't perform in Florida and other states with a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a video posted on YouTube, the 63-year-old singer said at a concert in Quebec City, Canada, on Sunday &quot;that until the 'stand your ground' law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wonder added: &quot;Wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A call to Paculis' court-appointed attorney was not answered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case took form after Deen's culinary empire began crumbling in response to her acknowledging during a deposition that she used racial slurs in the past.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not many people read &quot;The Cuckoo's Calling&quot; before word leaked out over the weekend that author Robert Galbraith was, in fact, J.K. Rowling. But a handful who did managed to get a signed copy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that could mean a lot of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rowling spokeswoman Nicky Stonehill told the Associated Press on Tuesday that Rowling, the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; author, signed a few copies of her detective novel as &quot;Robert Galbraith.&quot;</SPAN></P>
