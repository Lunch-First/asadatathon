<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Victor Cruz emerged contrite and reflective yesterday after the Giants' Pro Bowl wideout was part of a dustup on Twitter over the weekend in the aftermath of the George Zimmerman trial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz repeatedly apologized after tweeting Saturday what some took to be a call to violence against Zimmerman after the neighborhood watchman was acquitted in the Florida shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Thoroughly confused. Zimmerman doesn't last a year before the hood catches up to him,&quot; Cruz wrote on Twitter late Saturday night before deleting the tweet soon afterward. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz said yesterday he regretted the tweet almost immediately. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Once I put it out [there], I read it, and I was like, 'You know, it was the wrong thing to do,' &quot; Cruz told WFAN's Boomer Esiason and Craig Carton. &quot;I see kids that follow me. I'm a role model to a lot of these kids, and they follow me and look up to me, and I felt like it wasn't the right thing to post.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz said the negative reaction was immediate and fierce, and included some Twitter users calling him the n-word, a response he called &quot;pretty shocking.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fresh off a five-year, $43 million extension from the Giants he signed last week, Cruz said he now realizes he is expected to behave to a higher standard now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;When you're in the position like I am and have some success and you become a public figure, not just in New York City but across the world, you have an entitlement to promote positivity [because] there's going to be a lot of eyes that look up to you,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm the last guy that wants to promote violence on anyone in any way, shape or form.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz said he didn't receive any blowback from the Giants over the incident. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;They were pleased with the way we handled it,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
