<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A juror who has been vocal since the acquittal of George Zimmerman said Tuesday night in a CNN interview that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin &quot;played a huge role&quot; in his own death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When George confronted him ... he could have walked away and gone home,&quot; the woman, identified only as juror B-37, said of the 17-year-old. &quot;He didn't have to do whatever he did and come back and be in a fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-woman jury on Saturday acquitted Zimmerman, 29, a neighborhood watch volunteer, of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the February 2012 shooting death of Trayvon in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror said earlier Tuesday that she dropped plans to write a book about the trial. Her interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper partly aired Monday and continued Tuesday. Her face was not visible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to notes from the jury selection process, juror B-37 is a white, middle-aged woman who works as a chiropractor. She is the daughter of an Air Force captain, has two adult children and has been married to an attorney for 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that she and other jurors felt a lot of sympathy for what happened to Trayvon and that she wished she could have given his family &quot;the verdict they wanted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want people to think that we didn't think about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; she said.  &quot;We did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that she and other jurors wanted to convict Zimmerman of something but that there was nothing legally they could do. &quot;I wanted to find him guilty of not using his senses,&quot; the juror said. &quot;You can't charge him with anything because he didn't do anything unlawful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she believed the situation got out of control, partly because of what both Zimmerman and Trayvon did. &quot;George got in a little too deep,&quot; she said. &quot;But Trayvon got mad and attacked him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Tuesday, four other jurors issued a statement saying juror B-37's opinions &quot;were her own, and not in any way representative&quot; of their views. &quot;The death of a teenager weighed heavily on our hearts but in the end we did what the law required us to do,&quot; their statement said. <BR></SPAN></P>
