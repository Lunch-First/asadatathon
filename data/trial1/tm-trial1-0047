<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AL SHARPTON has a new, decades-younger, attractive main squeeze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil rights activist and MSNBC star, 58, is dating 35-year-old Aisha McShaw, a Westchester &quot;personal stylist&quot; who has been seen on Sharpton's arm at several recent black-tie affairs, including the White House Correspondents Dinner in April and President Obama's holiday party in December. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she arrived in a form-fitting black and white dress with a sharp-suited Sharpton at the New York County Democratic Committee Award Ceremony on Monday night, the Daily News asked her to define her relationship with the civil rights powerhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm his girlfriend,&quot; McShaw said before Sharpton intervened to shepherd her away from a reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told The News that she works as a &quot;personal stylist,&quot; but Sharpton quickly shuffled her off without letting her elaborate on her profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He refused to answer a question about how long the two had been an item.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton's relationship with McShaw appears to be the most serious one he's had since separating from his wife Kathy in 2004 after 24 years of marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, Sharpton's publicist said the two - who met when Kathy was working as a backup singer for James Brown - had simply grown apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton has been spending a lot of time with McShaw. The two have been photographed at elegant bashes all over the country for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young stylist, who is registered to vote as independent in Mamaroneck, says on her LinkedIn page that she works in financial services as a personal banker at Wells Fargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Sharpton was tight-lipped about his personal life Monday, the normally press-loving rabble-rouser was happy to pontificate with reporters on the city's political races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eliot Spitzer and Scott Stringer - Democratic rivals in the high-profile race for city controller - had both recently reached out to him, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have not made an endorsement there. . . . Both of them have called me and I told both of them that I was in the middle of the Trayvon Martin thing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
