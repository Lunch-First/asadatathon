</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adrian Peterson has demonstrated once again that he's one of the NFL's gentlemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peterson was among the athletes who reacted, and responded appropriately on Twitter, to the not-guilty verdict in the Florida trial of George Zimmerman over the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USA Today reported that Giants star Victor Cruz tweeted, &quot;Zimmerman doesn't last a year before the hood catches up with him.&quot; Cruz later deleted that, explaining himself in tweets and at least one appearance on ESPN's &quot;Mike and Mike&quot; show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falcons wide receiver Roddy White was in an eye-for-an-eye mode, too, when he vented: &quot;All them jurors should go home tonight and kill themselves for letting a grown man get away with killing a kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peterson, the Vikings running back, tweeted this: &quot;My Heart goes out to the Martin Family! Keep the Faith! #God is in control, He's the one and only Judge!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others on Twitter tried to bait Peterson by belittling his tweets, but he stayed cool and logical: &quot;You don't go out looking for trouble!!! Neighborhood Watch means WATCH &amp; report! Not initiate &amp; take things into your own hands ... I'm different if i was in Zimmerman shoes that night. I stay in my car n watch especially known I'm safe with a loaded pistol on my waist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interesting to see that as far as I can tell, Twitter's Larry Fitzgerald has exercised his right not to comment on the verdict. I'm sure he's sent a private message to Trayvon's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One last tweet sent out with little thought came from repeat NBA Champion Dwyane Wade of the Heat: &quot;Wow! Stunned!! Saddened as a father!! Som1 make sense of this verdict for me right now please!!! ... How do I explain this to my boys?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dwyane Wade has been a black male all his life, so he should have no problem explaining that life's especially unfair to some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like a rock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Art Garfunkel treated me to the sounds of silence last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tipster thought he or she saw Garfunkel in the metro a few days after his sold-out &quot;acoustic rehearsal&quot; at the Cedar. To confirm he was here, I called the establishment where I was told Garfunkel was staying. Maybe he'll return my next call if I don't disclose his off-the-beaten-path place of lodging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no answer,&quot; said a woman whom I'm going to identify as Bonnie. &quot;Do you want me to leave a message for him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, please, I told Bonnie, who responded with &quot;Call Ms. C.J.&quot; Bonnie laughed when told that the initials would suffice, although the late Tiny Tim would address me only with the &quot;Ms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he knows you're calling?&quot; asked Bonnie. &quot;No?&quot; she said, laughing at my response. &quot;Do you think he's going to want to call you back?&quot; I told Bonnie she'd be surprised who'll call me back - sometimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;May I ask how you know that he's here?&quot; said Bonnie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Come on, disclosing that wouldn't make my tipster happy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm just sitting by the phone, waiting for Garfunkel to call me, although I think I have a better chance of hearing from Paul Simon, who can call me Al if he wants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was that Spiderman or CJ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MyTalk 107.1's Lori Barghini chickened out of rappelling the 214 feet down the 23-story Hyatt on Nicollet Mall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At media day last week for &quot;Over the Edge,&quot; a fundraiser of the National Youth Recovery Foundation, Barghini came to watch but wouldn't rappel because she didn't want to tempt fate on her birthday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breaking the hearts of some who stood around to watch various media daredevils, I survived the descent. The only reason I was mildly interested in attempting it was that I wanted to shoot a video for startribune.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weird camera angles are the result of the video being shot from what I've named &quot;My Left Ovary Cam,&quot; because the body harness stopped me from hanging the camera where it was originally designed to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C.J. can be reached at cj@startribune.com and seen on FOX 9's &quot;Buzz.&quot; E-mailers, please state a subject; &quot;Hello&quot; does not count. Attachments are not opened.</SPAN></P>
