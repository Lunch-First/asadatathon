THE vigilante who killed black teenager TrayvonMartin was in hiding last night as protests against his acquittal of murder swept the US. 
Most demonstrations passed off peacefully after President Obama appealed for calm. But five people were arrested in Los Angeles and police fired bean bags at people who had blocked a motorway.
Arrests were made after a protest outside a CNN building in Hollywood, where demonstrators chanted "No Justice, No Peace."
Neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, 29, was cleared of second-degree murder by a jury on Saturday. He shot dead Trayvon, 17, in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012, claiming self-defence.
Zimmerman, described by his lawyer as a "pariah", went into hiding after death threats.
The racially-charged case has divided America, with the black population angry at what they see as failed justice for the victim.
There were fears of widespread riots, similar to those in 1992 when four white policemen were cleared after being videoed beating black motorist Rodney King.
With tensions running high, President Obama appealed for calm and asked people to respect the jury's decision.
He called Martin's death a tragedy, "Not just for his family, or any one community, but for America".
Zimmerman could face another trial, with the Department of Justice considering bringing race hate charges.
