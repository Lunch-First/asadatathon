ZIMMERMAN JURY
ONE of six women jurors who cleared George Zimmerman of murdering unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin has scrapped plans for a book about the trial.
It came as US Attorney-General Eric Holder called today for a rethink of stand-your-ground laws, telling the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People: ``We must stand our ground . . . it's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defence and sow dangerous conflict in our neighbourhoods.'' 
Woman juror B-37 said she had been shielded from public ``pain'' about the racially-charged case as a juror.
``I realise it was necessary for our jury to be sequestered to protect our verdict from unfair outside influence but that isolation shielded me from the depth of pain that exists among the general public over every aspect of this case,'' she said.
``The best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book and return instead to my life as it was before.''
Juror B-37 earlier told CNN details of deliberations before the Florida jury issued its verdict.
She said the jury of five white women and one Hispanic woman was evenly split when deliberations began.
``We had three not guilties, one second degree murder and two manslaughters,'' said the juror, adding she voted not guilty.
``It was just so confusing with what and what we could apply to what. Because I mean, there was a couple of them in there that wanted to find him guilty of something,'' she said.
``After hours of deliberating the law and reading it over and over, we decided there's just no way.''
