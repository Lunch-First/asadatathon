Every now and then, America generates the perfect media storm. The death of Trayvon Martin was one such, featuring just about every hot-button law-and-order issue: guns and neighbourhood vigilantes, self-defence and the right to carry concealed weapons. And of course, permeating everything, race. 
Race was barely mentioned during the month-long trial, but it hung over proceedings like a poisonous vapour. History is likely to add the Martin case to a long line stretching from the pre-civil-rights-era show trials of blacks subjected to Jim Crow justice, through to the acquittal of the Los Angeles police officers in the beating of black motorist Rodney King in 1992, and the ultimate media circus of the OJ trial.
The difference is that, unlike in the parodies of justice in the segregated South where blacks were automatically convicted if accused of a crime against a white, this time the strictly legal outcome - the acquittal of Zimmerman by his peers - feels right. The law has not been an ass.
This case will surely not have the same impact on race relations in the US as the Rodney King case did, still less the 1968 murder of Martin Luther King, when cities went up in flames. Yes, there has been heated rhetoric, claims that the bad old days were never truly banished. But the protests in the 24 hours after the verdict - heartfelt yet almost entirely peaceful - surely tell a more accurate story.
