<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wonder added: &quot;Wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot; The &quot;stand your ground&quot; law allows people to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Punk protesters are back at it o Russian provocateurs Pussy Riot are back in action, releasing a new music video more than a year since three members went to prison for a prank denouncing Vladimir Putin. The video shows band members in trademark bright-colored ski masks and short skirts, cavorting and shrieking atop an oil rig. Backed by hectic guitar and drums , they pour oil on a large photo of state oil giant Rosneft's chairman and liken Putin to an Iranian ayatollah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One member of the collective, who gave only her stage name of Grelka, said after the video's release Tuesday that &quot;the main message is that Putin has spread the country's wealth among his friends.&quot; Three members were sentenced to two years for an anti-Putin &quot;punk prayer&quot; in Moscow's main cathedral. One was later released on probation.</SPAN></P>
