<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yorkers will join people across the nation in a peaceful demonstration Saturday to honor the life of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager whose killer was acquitted Saturday of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizer Sandie Walker said she envisions a prayerful vigil near the York County Judicial Center to honor Martin followed by a speaker-driven discussion of the larger issues surrounding the emotional case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker said she'd prefer to avoid focusing on George Zimmerman's not-guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opportunity: Instead, the York City School Board member said, this is an opportunity to talk about racial profiling and weaknesses in the United States' judicial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to be aware of the fact that race does still play a part, even if it's unconscious or conscious, it does affect how people act and how they react at times,&quot; Walker said. &quot;Let's just be honest and speak about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group will gather at noon Saturday near the courthouse, 45 N. George St. Other cities across the nation are planning similar vigils, Walker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case: On Feb. 26, 2012, Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, followed 17-year-old Martin as he walked to the home of his father's girlfriend after buying snacks at a convenience store. Following a struggle, Zimmerman shot the unarmed black teenager in the chest. He claimed self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal has triggered emotional outrage, especially among those who believe Zimmerman targeted Martin because of the way he looked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what happened during those minutes when they encountered each other,&quot; Walker said. &quot;But what I do know is another life has been lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March in D.C.: Another group of Yorkers is planning to join a protest march in Washington, D.C., next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the organizers, Rebecca Moore, said the Zimmerman case touched a nerve with her especially because of her own experience as a neighborhood watch volunteer. Zimmerman should never have followed Martin, especially after a 911 dispatcher advised him not to, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're fearful for your life, you're not getting out of your vehicle and approaching anybody,&quot; Moore said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bus seating 55 people will leave York from Small Athletic Field at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, July 24. In Washington, they'll join a 3 p.m. march to the U.S. Department of Justice building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers split the cost of the bus 55 ways, resulting in each seat costing $23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money is due Monday. Contact Moore at (717) 424-3676 to reserve a spot on the bus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere,&quot; Moore said. &quot;If we keep sitting back and allowing the injustice to prevail, we're just as guilty as the person that's creating the injustice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
