<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder should be mindful of his words on the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin case. His recent comments seem to give credibility to the opponents of the recent decision rendered by the Florida court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a lawyer, and considering his position as attorney general, the man should be intimately aware of the facts and evidence in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he has not been so informed, this says little for his office. His remarks may just give false hope to those who wish to see another result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This entire episode has been the result of poor judgment on the part of the two participants. Let's not extend this by giving false hope to those who want a different result and those who may be hurt or killed by those who seek a different ending.</SPAN></P>
