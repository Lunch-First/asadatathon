<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">where we stand Racism might have been a factor in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death. But that doesn't mean the jury reached the wrong verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If George Zimmerman and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had both been of the same race, we likely would not know either of their names. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a white man in Florida had killed an unarmed teenager who was also white, it still would have been a tragic death. But it would not have captured the attention of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two, however, were not the same race. And Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a young black man in a hoodie, a description too often stereotyped as being &quot;suspicious,&quot; as George Zimmerman believed. That shouldn't have happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those facts alone do not mean the jury was wrong to find Zimmerman not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All kinds of people this week are proclaiming to know better than the jurors - based largely on watching copious amounts of CNN. They believe that Zimmerman wrongly stereotyped Martin and, therefore, he should be found guilty of some charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American justice system, however, is far more complicated than that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The burden our court system puts on prosecutors is great: It demands that defendants be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If a jury thinks a defendant might have done it, but might not have - that's a reasonable doubt. Even if a jury thinks the defendant probably did it, but they just aren't sure - that, too, is a reasonable doubt. In this case, the jury was instructed by the court that Zimmerman was allowed to use deadly force not only if he actually faced death or bodily harm but if he merely thought he did. In that case, the defendant should be found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the microscope of national media, the trial progressed and the state made its case. Little evidence was provided to challenge Zimmerman's story, and jurors had no choice but to acquit. That's the way our system works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's tragic that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is dead. It's unfortunate that George Zimmerman got out of his truck that fateful night (dispatchers told him not to). But he did get out. And Martin died at Zimmerman's hand. It's a sad story, and racism very likely plays a part. Racism might also play a role in why police and prosecutors were reluctant to charge Zimmerman in the first place - that will be up to the city of Sanford to determine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when it came to the trial, it wasn't racism that impacted the outcome. Our justice system is designed to protect the accused, and in this case, prosecutors just couldn't come up with enough evidence to prove Zimmerman guilty.</SPAN></P>
