<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lester Chambers -- a member of the Chambers Brothers, best known for their 1968 hit &quot;Time Has Come Today&quot; -- had a bruised rib muscle and nerve damage after he was attacked Saturday at the Hayward Russell City Blues Festival, family members told The San Jose Mercury News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers dedicated the Curtis Mayfield hit &quot;People Get Ready&quot; to the slain Florida teen, the newspaper reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said 43-year-old Dinalynn Andrews Potter of Barstow yelled &quot;it's all your fault&quot; before shoving 73-year-old Chambers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She must have been an acrobat,&quot; Lola Chambers, Lester Chambers' wife, told the Mercury News. &quot;She did it in one leap. He didn't see her coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrews Potter was arrested on suspicion of battery, cited and released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, was found not guilty of second-degree murder in last year's death of Martin, who was black. The jury had the option to consider manslaughter but declined to convict him of the lesser charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case prompted debate nationwide over racial profiling, self-defense and equal justice. Zimmerman was acquitted Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers' family wants police to file hate crime charges. Andrews Potter is white, they said. Chambers is black.</SPAN></P>
