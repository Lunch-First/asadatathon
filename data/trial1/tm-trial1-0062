<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media beat-up of George Zimmerman makes me sick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Scott, in a scurrilous cartoon (July 15), idiotically suggests hands aren't possible of killing as much as guns are. And today (World, July 16) the Dominion Post headline calls Mr Zimmerman a ''killer'', despite his acquittal of all charges in the shooting of Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly the media has a narrative it promotes and evidence be damned. ''Racist white kills black.'' Put any names in the blanks and run the bromide. Only they jumped the gun on this one - Mr Zimmerman is Hispanic and not racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite appalling interference from the White House and media distortion, the jury said it was self- defence, but the mob wants a lynching.</SPAN></P>
