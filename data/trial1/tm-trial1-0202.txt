Regarding "Florida verdict stirs up nation" [front page, July 15]:
There is something rotten in the state of Florida if an armed volunteer, having pursued and killed an unarmed boy , is then judged to have no criminal responsibility in the death of a minor. The boy was minding his own business; the man made it his business to confront him despite a prior suggestion from the police not to pursue him. If permissive laws protect this act, when and where are we safe?

Like the victims of Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., Trayvon Martin is a  victim of gun violence and over-permissive gun laws. Because of Florida's "stand your ground" law, and the burden of proof required to get around a claim of self-defense, the jury in this case had little choice but to find George Zimmerman not guilty. Not guilty, but not innocent either.
The real villains in the Martin case are the 40-odd Republicans and four Democratic senators in Washington who refused to pass stricter gun-control laws and the Florida legislature, which passed "stand your ground" and other laws that make it easy to carry a lethal weapon. 
The United States is still, in the second decade of the 21st century, an angry, racially divided and violent nation.

George Zimmerman has been acquitted, but he actually will never be a free man. This case will haunt him and follow him and his family forever. You could say that the real killer is the state of Florida. Combine "stand your ground," neighborhood watch and novices having handguns, and you have a crime waiting to happen. 
This verdict will linger forever in the minds of people looking for justice; this case is not over yet.
