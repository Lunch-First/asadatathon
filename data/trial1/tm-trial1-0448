And nothing about that sounds like murder? My baby brother is 17, this rocked my whole sh*t! #thesystemisandhasalways beenph**ked [sic].&quot; <BR> Vibe magazine reported that Wyclef Jean released a song called Justice (If You're 17) as a tribute to Martin. <BR> US President Barack Obama called for people to respect the verdict. <BR> Selected celebrity tweets:<BR> oNicki Minaj (@NICKI MINAJ): &quot;And our taxes paid for that trial. We just paid to see a murderer walk free after killing an innocent unarmed little boy. #GodBlessAmerica.&quot;<BR> oRick Ross (@Mastermind): &quot;My condolences continue go to the Martin family.&quot; <BR> oKim Kardashian (@Kim Kardashian): &quot;My heart goes out to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family &amp; loved ones.
