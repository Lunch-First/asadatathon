<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't like what George Zimmerman did and I hate that Trayvon Martin is dead. But I also can understand why Zimmerman was suspicious and why he thought Martin was wearing a uniform we all recognize. I don't know if Zimmerman is a racist. Yet I'm tired of politicians and others who have donned hoodies in solidarity with Martin and who essentially suggest that I am a racist for recognizing the reality of urban crime in America. The hoodie blinds them as much as it did Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those who quickly donned a hoodie was Christine Quinn, the speaker of the New York City Council. Quinn was hardly a lonesome panderer. Lesser politicians joined her and, like her, pronounced Zimmerman a criminal. &quot;What George Zimmerman did was wrong, was a crime,&quot; Quinn said before knowing all of the facts and before the jury unaccountably found otherwise. She was half right. What Zimmerman did was wrong. It was not, by verdict of his peers, a crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where is the politician who will own up to the painful complexity of the problem and acknowledge the widespread fear of crime committed by young black males? This does not mean that raw racism has disappeared and some judgments are not the product of invidious stereotyping. It does mean, though, that the public knows that young black males commit a disproportionate amount of crime. In New York City, blacks comprise 23.4 percent of the population yet they represent 78 percent of all shooting suspects -- almost all of them young men. We know them from the nightly news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those statistics represent the justification for New York City's controversial stop-and-frisk program, which amounts to racial profiling writ large. After all, if young black males are your shooters then it ought to be young black males that the cops stop and frisk. Still, common sense and common decency -- not to mention the law -- insist on other variables such as suspicious behavior, but race is a factor, without a doubt. It would be senseless for the cops to be stopping Danish tourists in Times Square just to make the statistics look good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish I had a solution to this problem. If I were a young black male and was stopped just on account of my appearance, I would feel violated. If the cops are abusing their authority and using race as the only reason, that has got to stop. But if they ignore race, then they are fools and ought to go into another line of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The least we can do is talk honestly about the problem. It does no one any good to merely cite the number of stops and frisks made on black males and not cite the murder statistics as well. Citing the former and not the latter is an Orwellian exercise in political correctness. It not only censors half of the story but suggests that racism is the sole reason for the policy. This mindlessness, like racism itself, is repugnant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one time, I thought Barack Obama would bring the problem into the open and remove the racist stigma. Instead, he perpetuated it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his acclaimed Philadelphia speech on race, he cited his grandmother as &quot;a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her by on the street.&quot; How about the former Barry Obama? When he was a Columbia University student living on the lip of then-dangerous Harlem, did he never have the same fear?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no doubt in my mind that Zimmerman profiled Martin and, braced by a gun, set off in quest of heroism. The result was a quintessentially American tragedy -- the death of a young man understandably suspected because he was black and tragically dead for the same reason.</SPAN></P>
