U.S. attorney-general eric Holder has now decided to focus further attention on the tragedy of black teenager Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot by community guard George Zimmerman. 
It has been suggested that Mr. Holder and his department of Justice (dOJ) would be far better employed if, for example, they paid significant attention to the rash of deaths over the July 4 weekend. One headline has: "deadly July 4 Weekend in Chicago: 9 Killed, 55 Injured." The story goes on to record that the "littlest victims" were boys of five and seven. This was just in Chicago, where the death toll for the year reached 200.
It does not take too much common sense to realize that tragic as it was, the Zimmerman/Martin case is a single case out of a multitude of others. Mr. Holder and the dOJ should process this logic and concentrate their efforts where they might achieve more widespread and lasting benefit, including the current mob violence. That may get Mr. Holder less recognition from his community, but would be much more useful. David Hogg, Toronto.
