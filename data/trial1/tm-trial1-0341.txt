ZIMMERMAN AFTERMATH
GEORGE Zimmerman will now carry the same gun he used to kill Trayvon Martin -- and he's going to need it, his lawyer says.
Lawyer Mark O'Mara said Zimmerman's acquittal by a Florida jury means he'll get back the Kel Tec-9 pistol he used to fatally shoot Martin last year. 
He said Zimmerman, 29, intends to alway carry the weapon.
``(There's) even more reason now, isn't there? There are a lot of people out there who actually hate him, though they shouldn't,'' O'Mara said.
Zimmerman's brother, Robert Jr, said George had no regrets over the deadly confrontation.
``Regret implies that your actions you have culpability in what you did for what happened. What you're asking is, `Does he share or accept the blame?' George, outside of the word blame, feels and has felt, very bad,'' he said. But he insisted his brother had nothing to apologise for.
``I don't think people who are forthcoming and forthright in what they do and believe they're doing the right thing should then go back,'' he said.
The US Justice Department has responded to appeals to probe whether Zimmerman committed any civil rights violations in the shooting.
Meanwhile, book agent Sharlene Martin confirmed today that one of the jurors is to write a book explaining the verdict, claiming she was contacted by juror B-37 the day after the verdict and signed her.
``The reader will learn why jurors had no option but to find Zimmerman not guilty due to the manner in which he was charged and the content of the jury instructions,'' Martin said.
