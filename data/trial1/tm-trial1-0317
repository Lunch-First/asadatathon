<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Justice Department has announced it will reopen its own investigation into George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer who shot dead an unarmed teenager in Florida in February 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal inquiry, which had been suspended pending the criminal trial, will look into whether Zimmerman, 29, can be prosecuted on hate-crime charges. Civil rights leaders said they still believe the shooting occurred in part because its victim, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of peaceful demonstrators joined a rally that began in New York's Union Square on Sunday afternoon and later flooded into Times Square, remaining there until late into the night. Meanwhile, protests on the West Coast, in Los Angeles and San Francisco, were dispersed by police firing beanbag rounds. They followed a series of impromptu demonstrations in cities across the US on Saturday night, including in Washington DC, Atlanta and Oakland.</SPAN></P>
