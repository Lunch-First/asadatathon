<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's first black Attorney-General last night denounced the country's &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; laws following the acquittal of a Neighbourhood Watch volunteer in Florida over the killing of a black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing civil rights leaders, Eric Holder acknowledged the passions stirred by the racially tinged trial of George Zimmerman, who was found not guilty at the weekend of murdering Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Separate and apart from the case that has drawn the nation's attention, it's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defence and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A million Americans have heaped pressure on Mr Holder by demanding that Trayvon's killer be prosecuted for a hate crime.Weekend protests are planned in 100 US cities. In Los Angeles, 13 people were arrested during a second night of riots. Shops, cars and businesses had windows broken, traffic was blocked and passers-by assaulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Jurors yesterday revealed that half the six-strong panel - five white and one Hispanic, all of them women - initially wanted to convict Mr Zimmerman of second-degree murder or manslaughter. But after 16 hours of wrangling they agreed that he had not acted out of hatred, and that his use of deadly force was Justified. &quot;If he felt threatened, then his life was going to be taken away from him or he's going to have bodily harm, then he had a right [to shoot],&quot; the woman, a middle-aged mother of two who once held a concealed weapon permit, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida is one of 30 states to have adopted &quot;stand-your-gound&quot; laws that Justify homicide in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, who lived in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, wrongly assumed that Trayvon was &quot;up to no good&quot; on the night of February 26 last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, 17, was unarmed and on his way to his father's girlfriend's house. A fight ensued, ending with the shooting.</SPAN></P>
