Pacers announce signing of Chris Copeland
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - The Indiana Pacers have officially announced they signed free-agent forward Chris Copeland, who spent last season with the New York Knicks. 
Copeland averaged 8.7 points on 47.9 percent shooting, including 42.1 percent from 3-point range, and 2.1 rebounds per game while helping lead the Knicks to the Atlantic Division title.
Before signing with the Knicks in 2012, Copeland played overseas in Belgium, Germany and Spain. The former University of Colorado standout also played one season in the NBA Developmental League. Larry Bird, the Pacers' president of basketball operations, calls Copeland "a great addition" because of his versatility. Coach Frank Vogel adds that Copeland has a "great story of perseverance and he reached a level where he was a key player on a 54-win team last year."
Cruz apologizes for Zimmerman tweet
New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz has apologized for a message he sent on Twitter in the wake of the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial.
Cruz sent a series of tweets Sunday calling his message from a night earlier a "mistake," adding that he "never will advocate violence under any circumstances." The original message has since been deleted.
"I apologize, that's why I deleted it," one of Cruz's messages says. "I believe conversation not confrontation leads to change and progress."
Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch volunteer, was acquitted of second-degree murder in the shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin after a three-week trial in Florida.
