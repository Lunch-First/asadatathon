VICTORVILLE -- Sheriff's deputies from several High Desert stations responded to a rally/march at the Mall of Victor Valley on Wednesday. 
About 80 people participated in a response to Saturday's acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida.Law enforcement officers said they made 17 arrests, eight of them were juveniles. Many of the arrests were for unlawful assembly.
Most in the group were peaceful and obeyed the law, sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Bachman said in a news release.
There was a report that 10 to 15 juveniles went into a Chevron gas station at Bear Valley and Balsam roads, opened items and left without paying, she said.
A large group of individuals had gathered in the mall parking lot and began running and trying to enter the mall, but mall security locked all doors and no one got in, Bachman said.
Deputies made several announcements for the group to disperse, and most left without incident, the news release said.
Six to eight individuals were detained for failure to disperse, Bachman said..
There were no reports of injury or damage.
