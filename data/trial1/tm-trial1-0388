<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department says it's considering criminal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman in the aftermath of his acquittal in the shooting of Trayvon Martin. But its resources, and those of the public, would be far better spent investigating prosecutory misconduct for a political prosecution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, 29, a Hispanic, was found not guilty late Saturday in the February 2012 death of Mr. Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old, in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman claimed self-defense. The jury obviously found enough reasonable doubt - the legal standard - that it could not abide the prosecution's second-degree murder charge or even a lesser charge of manslaughter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this case was a political prosecution from the start. The local police chief who, based on the facts declined to file charges, was forced from office. The Seminole-Broward County state's attorney said Zimmerman acted in self-defense. But that wasn't good enough for those calling for Zimmerman's head. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under pressure, Gov. Rick Scott appointed a special prosecutor, Angela Cory. And there are credible allegations that she did not disclose pertinent evidence that, exculpatory to Zimmerman, appears to affirm earlier decisions not to charge him. (A staffer in her office was fired for disclosing some of that information.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are allegations that the Justice Department aided in anti-Zimmerman protests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America's system of criminal justice is seriously broken,&quot; F.H. Buckley, a law professor at George Mason University, writes about the case in The American Spectator. But certainly not for the reasons that post-verdict protesters have been citing. </SPAN></P>
