<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Florida verdict stirs up nation&quot; [front page, July 15]:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is something rotten in the state of Florida if an armed volunteer, having pursued and killed an unarmed boy , is then judged to have no criminal responsibility in the death of a minor. The boy was minding his own business; the man made it his business to confront him despite a prior suggestion from the police not to pursue him. If permissive laws protect this act, when and where are we safe? </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the victims of Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., Trayvon Martin is a  victim of gun violence and over-permissive gun laws. Because of Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, and the burden of proof required to get around a claim of self-defense, the jury in this case had little choice but to find George Zimmerman not guilty. Not guilty, but not innocent either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real villains in the Martin case are the 40-odd Republicans and four Democratic senators in Washington who refused to pass stricter gun-control laws and the Florida legislature, which passed &quot;stand your ground&quot; and other laws that make it easy to carry a lethal weapon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is still, in the second decade of the 21st century, an angry, racially divided and violent nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry A. Lowenstein, New York</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman has been acquitted, but he actually will never be a free man. This case will haunt him and follow him and his family forever. You could say that the real killer is the state of Florida. Combine &quot;stand your ground,&quot; neighborhood watch and novices having handguns, and you have a crime waiting to happen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This verdict will linger forever in the minds of people looking for justice; this case is not over yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernie Kessler, Ocean Pines, Md.</SPAN></P>
