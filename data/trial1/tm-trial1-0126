<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US Attorney General Eric Holder has called for a rethink of &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; laws following the acquittal of a neighbourhood watch volunteer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Holder acknowledged the passions stirred by the racially-tinged trial of George Zimmerman, found not guilty on Saturday of murdering Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Separate and apart from the case that has drawn the nation&quot;s attention, it&quot;s time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighbourhoods,&quot; Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These laws try to fix something that was never broken. There has always been a legal defence for using deadly force if -- and the &quot;if&quot; is important -- no safe retreat is available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s trial lawyers did not explicitly invoke Florida&quot;s stand-your-ground law, arguing instead that he acted in self-defence in a confrontation with Martin in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the case has stirred up controversy around such laws, which assert that citizens can use lethal force if they feel their lives are threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By allowing and perhaps encouraging violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety. The list of resulting tragedies is long and - unfortunately - has victimised too many who are innocent,&quot; Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our collective obligation - we must stand our ground - to ensure that our laws reduce violence, and take a hard look at laws that contribute to more violence than they prevent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of the verdict from the six-woman and mostly white jury argue that Zimmerman had racially profiled Martin -- who had no criminal record -- and was able to kill him with impunity because of a biased criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder, who spoke at the NAACP national meeting in Orlando, Florida, not far from where Martin died, remained non-committal on whether the Justice Department might pursue Zimmerman on civil rights grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Justice Department has an open investigation&quot; into the case, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While that inquiry is ongoing, I can promise that the Department of Justice will consider all available information before determining what action to take.&quot;</SPAN></P>
