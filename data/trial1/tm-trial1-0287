<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE vigilante who killed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was in hiding last night as protests against his acquittal of murder swept the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most demonstrations passed off peacefully after President Obama appealed for calm. But five people were arrested in Los Angeles and police fired bean bags at people who had blocked a motorway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrests were made after a protest outside a CNN building in Hollywood, where demonstrators chanted &quot;No Justice, No Peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, 29, was cleared of second-degree murder by a jury on Saturday. He shot dead Trayvon, 17, in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012, claiming self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, described by his lawyer as a &quot;pariah&quot;, went into hiding after death threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racially-charged case has divided America, with the black population angry at what they see as failed justice for the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were fears of widespread riots, similar to those in 1992 when four white policemen were cleared after being videoed beating black motorist Rodney King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With tensions running high, President Obama appealed for calm and asked people to respect the jury's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called Martin's death a tragedy, &quot;Not just for his family, or any one community, but for America&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman could face another trial, with the Department of Justice considering bringing race hate charges.</SPAN></P>
