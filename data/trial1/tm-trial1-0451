<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US President Barack Obama has appealed to Americans for restraint amid anger from civil rights activists and public protests against the acquittal of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury comprising six women, reportedly five white and a hispanic, found neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second-degree murder, having pursued Martin, 17, through a gated community in the town of Sanford, eventually shooting him during an altercation on February 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial divided those who believed that Zimmerman, whose father is white and mother is Peruvian, had racially-profiled Martin and those who believed he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spontaneous protests broke out in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta overnight following the verdict, although they were mostly peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, a large demonstration in New York attracted several thousand people, with placards that read, ``Jail racist killers, not black youth'', and ``We are all Trayvon. The whole damn system is guilty''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr Obama, the first black US president, urged people to accept the trial verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,'' he said. ``I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.''</SPAN></P>
