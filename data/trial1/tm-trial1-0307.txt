PRESIDENT Barack Obama has appealed for calm after an acquittal in the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin, saying: ``We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.''
``I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son,'' he said the day after a jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in a racially charged trial.
Mr Zimmerman, 29, was accused of pursuing Trayvon Martin, 17, through a gated community and shooting him on February 26, 2012.
