? After she was dropped by her literary agent, a juror in the George Zimmerman trial has decided against writing a book on the high-profile case, she said in a statement, citing the "depth of pain" many in the public associate with it. The woman known publicly only as B-37, her jury selection designation, said that serving in sequestration as a juror "shielded me from the depth of pain that exists among the general public over every aspect of this case." ? R&B singer Lester Chambers is recovering from injuries he suffered over the weekend after a woman leaped onto the stage and shoved him when he dedicated a song to TrayvonMartin during a concert in the San Francisco Bay Area. Family members said Chambers had a bruised rib muscle and nerve damage after he was attacked Saturday at the Hayward Russell City Blues Festival. Witnesses reportedly heard 43-year-old Dinalynn Andrews Potter shout "it's all your fault" before shoving Chambers, 73. Andrews Potter was arrested on suspicion of battery. ? Dozens of protesters carrying signs demanding justice for TrayvonMartin crammed into the lobby of Florida Gov. Rick Scott's office Tuesday and refused to leave until the governor either met with them or called lawmakers back to the Capitol to address the state's "stand your ground" law.
