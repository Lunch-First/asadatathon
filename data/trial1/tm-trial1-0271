<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GEORGE Zimmerman's acquittal for murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin has put American race relations back under the spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There may be an African-American in the White House but racial tensions are never far from the surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was shot by Zimmerman, 28, last February while walking to a relative's house in Florida holding a drink and some sweets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday the jury found Zimmerman - himself Hispanic - not guilty of second-degree murder. But does the verdict prove America is still mired in racial prejudice? And how does Britain compare when it comes to health, education and crime?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRISON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black people are overwhelmingly more likely to be jailed or executed than white people in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black people account for 13.1% of the US's 319 million people, yet make up 37.1% of the prison population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when it comes to death row, the statistics are even more startling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research found black defendants facing trial in Houston - dubbed the US death penalty capital - were more than three times as likely to be handed a possible death sentence than white ones. But white inmates on death row just outnumber black inmates - 43.2% compared to 41.9%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race of the victim also appears to play a part in a defendants' likelihood to be sentenced to death. Since 1976, 20 white defendants have been executed for killing a black victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 261 black defendants have been executed for killing a white victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain, ethnic minority inmates are also over-represented. In 2009, 10% of the prison population was black compared to 2% of the general population, according to the Prison Reform Trust. And between 1999 and 2002, the prison population grew by more than 12%, but the number of black prisoners increased by 51%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEALTH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White people live longer than black people, according to the American Department of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their 2011 study said whites had an expected lifespan of 78.8 years compared to 74.5 for blacks. And the American College of Physicians said in 2010: &quot;Overwhelming evidence shows that racial and ethnic minorities are prone to poorer quality healthcare than white Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disparities are seen in other ailments too. For instance, 16.4% of black children aged under 18 have asthma compared to 8.4% of white children. But only 7% of black children are prescribed asthma medication compared to 21% of whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, last year it emerged the group suffering the worst decline in life expectancy was the white working-class, in some cases reverting back to levels not seen in 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White working-class women saw their life expectancy fall from more than 78 in 1990 to 74 in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain, estimates from think-tank the Runnymede Trust reveal white men live on average a year longer on than Afro-Caribbean men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gap for women, meanwhile, was just five months. And Bangladeshi men have the lowest estimated life expectancy of all males - just 74.6 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INCOME</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black people are more likely to live in poverty than whites, who in turn have a higher chance of earning the top salaries. According to 2010 figures, 39.1% of black children live in poverty compared to just 12.4% of white children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, black Americans earned an average of &pound;401 per week. White workers took home 25% more and were on &pound;500, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. And more than 50% of black people aged 15 and above earned less than &pound;23,200 in 2008 compared with 35% of whites, the Census Bureau found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High earners were also much more likely to be white. While 10.8% of white workers made more than &pound;66,200, just 3.3% of black workers did. It is estimated there are fewer than 800 black executives in the top levels of Fortune 500 firms - equating to 2%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain does not fare much better, with the first black chief executive not promoted until 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 4.1% of FTSE 100 company directors come from ethnic minority backgrounds. And in terms of poverty, around two-fifths of ethnic minorities live in low-income households - double the rate for white people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDUCATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are gaps in educational achievement between black and white students, but experts put this down to poverty rather than race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some areas, African-American and Latino pupils aged 17 and 18 performed maths and reading at the level of 13-year-old white students, a study by the Education Trust found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It argued the disparity was down to poverty, an issue faced disproportionately by black youngsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while 34% of white people had degrees compared with 20% of black people, it was claimed that class had a bigger impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was backed by figures showing 79% of the richest quarter of US people get a degree compared to just 11% of the poorest quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, here it was said last month that poor white pupils were least likely to succeed at school. The inspectorate of schools found that since 2007, their Teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, George Zimmerman, left attainment was up just 13%, against a 22% leap from poor Bangladeshi pupils.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1954 Segregation in schools is declared illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1955 The Montgomery Bus Boycott begins on December 5 after Rosa Parks is arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white man on a bus. This boycott results in the end in the segregation system in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1956.</SPAN></P>
