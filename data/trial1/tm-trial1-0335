<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people united, we'll never be divided.&quot;<BR>Mario Manganiello: &quot;I just feel like it was a murder.&quot;<BR>Around 50 protestors from different groups took to the streets of Fresno. Handmade signs, upside down flags, this man even held a burned and tattered flag. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Phillips: &quot;We don't want to deal with the government right now, so we burned a flag to pretty much make a statement.&quot;<BR>They rallied in front of the federal courthouse Monday afternoon in support of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. This woman has five boys and relates to the case.<BR>Mickey Brewster: &quot;That could of been them walking to the store going to get me some candy, or skittles and they could have been profiled by how they wore or how they look.&quot;<BR>But many who agree with the verdict don't believe Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was racially profiled.<BR>Raymond Rodriguez: &quot;They didn't have anything on the guy, it was just self defense.&quot;<BR>Some don't believe prosecutors proved their case against Zimmerman, and they say the law is the law.<BR>Barry Swederofsky: &quot;I know if he didn't have a gun on him, that kid would still be alive, but you know that's just the law in Florida, so you gotta go by it.&quot;<BR>When the defense wins in a case there can be no appeal or retrial, but we may not have seen the last of this case.<BR>Carl Faller, Legal Analyst: &quot;There's some talk about a civil law suit or requesting an investigation by the justice department, those are things that remain to be seen.&quot;<BR>The White House says the president will not be getting involved with the case and whether or not civil rights charged should be pursued against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
