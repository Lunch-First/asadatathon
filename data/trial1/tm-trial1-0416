<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: I recently declined an offer to sign a referendum petition opposing an affordable senior housing development on Maybell Avenue. This development offers Palo Alto what looks to be an appropriate and relatively low-impact use of an available property. I've studied and worked in the affordable housing arena, and it is well established that senior apartment complexes of this type generate lower parking and traffic impacts than other types of housing. Seniors at this site won't drive as much -- certainly not at peak times -- and in fact some won't own a car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financing and development of affordable housing is complicated, and appropriate properties are extraordinarily hard to come by. And because of the complexities of tax-credit applications, nonprofit developers often receive loans from cities in advance of approval, though these loan commitments do not bind the cities to approve the projects. The professionals with the stamina to successfully put the pieces together and earn the unanimous approval of a project like this from the city council should receive our support. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're skeptical that we need affordable housing for seniors in Palo Alto, consider the South Palo Alto Food Closet where I volunteer a few hours a week. Some of the folks who pick up food here are your senior neighbors and friends, and they need more options to remain living here. And they could be you some day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rancho San Antonio Park</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: Neither the Santa Clara Valley Water District nor the Committee for Green Foothills cares about wasting $7 million in taxpayer money on a proposed flood basin in Rancho San Antonio Park, one of the largest open spaces in Santa Clara County. A half-million residents enjoy Rancho annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed 15-acre Rancho flood basin will remove more than 100 trees and 200,000 cubic yards of soil. It will destroy the existing wetland basin, something that would never be permitted if proposed by the private sector. The water district cannot defend its hydrology calculations, which independent local engineers Richard Moll and Mike Hayden say are exaggerated by at least 200 percent. Both Moll and Hayden contend the proposed Rancho basin will not have any meaningful flow. Do we have a different standard for the water district, here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In planning the Rancho basin, water district engineers have ignored the U.S. Geological Survey's 1986 report, 89-4130, which warns that altering the existing Rancho basin may destroy the natural wetland meadow and drop the natural, historic water table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 25, I telephoned the Committee for Green Foothills asking for support in the form of a letter to the water district questioning its plans for a basin at Rancho San Antonio Park, then followed up with environmental impact and hydrology reports from local experts. So far, no one has responded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't ban vehicle dwellers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: I am really concerned that the Palo Alto City Council has decided to move forward with establishing a ban on people sleeping in their vehicles. Most people will not choose to live out of their cars if they have a better place to live. Besides, it does not even make economic sense. Have they considered how much time and effort will have to be directed at going after these vehicle dwellers to issue warnings, then citations? And if they do not leave, or cannot pay the fines, then even more resources will be devoted to their arrests, court proceedings and perhaps even incarceration. Most of these car dwellers are just law-abiding citizens struggling to find jobs that pay enough for real housing. Turning them into criminals will make it that much harder to find employment. This is a vicious cycle that pushes more people deeper into homelessness.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin-Zimmerman case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: Since when does the aggressor of a fight have the right to plead self-defense? George Zimmerman stalked that 17-year-old kid who had not committed any crime. Zimmerman had no right to stop him and no right to question him. He intentionally provoked a defensive reaction out of the kid and committed an assault that forfeited his right to claim self-defense; only the kid had that right then, and Zimmerman was responsible for any ensuing result. If the kid beat him to death, he had the right of self-defense. If Zimmerman killed the kid while committing a crime, he was guilty of either murder or manslaughter. It then boiled down to &quot;intent.&quot; If the jury can infer from all the facts such as Zimmerman's racial statements, his carrying a gun, his disregard of the 911 dispatch that police were on their way, and his intent to kill or commit bodily harm, then the verdict should have been first-degree murder. Juries make mistake all the time. Remember the O.J. Simpson case, the Rodney King case and resulting riots, the Oscar Grant case? These juries have to live with consequences as we all do, until we find a better system.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: It all could have been so simple. Clearly, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin correctly believed that he was profiled as a potential criminal by a neighborhood watch volunteer. All Trayvon had to do was use his cellphone to record the evidence of this act and call police to diffuse any potential violent confrontation. With that evidence and a police report in hand, he could have then submitted a formal complaint of a violation of his civil rights through the many legal firms that pursue such cases for free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had he done so, had he availed himself of the protections afforded to him by our legal system and still lost his case, only then would our black community have had the right to call our legal system racist. Given the evidence and the proceedings of a fair trial, the jury could not believe that George Zimmerman pursued Trayvon with the intention of provoking a physical confrontation with the ultimate goal of killing him. On the contrary, the jury was convinced that Trayvon chose the path of violent confrontation instead of de-escalating the situation with the means provided to him by his cellphone and our legal system.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: It seems to me that anyone with any sense of values, fairness, human decency and respect for rational conclusions should avoid getting anywhere near Florida for any reason for about, say, 20 years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: Many people believe race had everything to do with the verdict in George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. I have another way of looking at it, though. I believe that Mr. Zimmerman also represents the law enforcement community, being what his role was that evening, and in what took place. If this had been a case involving a white man who was not highly placed in society, but someone who was from a poor family or had a record of involvement in the criminal justice system, there would definitely have been a different outcome. Also, if Zimmerman was in any way not a part of the status quo, meaning if he was not charged with protecting the property of a wealthy condominium community and possessing a clearance to carry a gun, he would have been treated differently by the law. It is so easy in America for members of minority groups to believe that all white people are treated the same and get the same breaks, or that all white people are rich and enjoy privileged lives. One must remember people like George Zimmerman, the Los Angeles Police Department and Johannes Mehserle were all tied in with the brotherhood of law enforcement officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The larger question is not the shooting to death of a young black man like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, but why there are so many young black men like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin wasting their lives away in the prison system who don't really need to be there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In closing, there have been a lot of homeless and mentally ill people who have been brutally beaten and killed by police, as well as members of the general public, and their cases have never even been heard in court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: I wasn't too surprised to see the not-guilty verdict in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case. I am concerned about the follow-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If peaceful protests result in a federal trial for George Zimmerman having violated Martin's civil rights by killing him, I could accept that. I do believe it violates our double jeopardy rule, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if another trial is the result of mob rule similar to the Rodney King case, I will lose whatever remaining respect I have for our criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
