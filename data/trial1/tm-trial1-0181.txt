Glee actor Cory Monteith died of an overdose of heroin and alcohol, the British Columbia coroner's office said Tuesday. "There is no evidence to suggest Mr. Monteith's death was anything other than a most tragic accident," the office said in a statement. The 31-year-old was found dead in his Vancouver, British Columbia, hotel room on Saturday, after he didn't check out on time. He was believed to be alone when he died.  
Police said Monteith had been out with people earlier, but video and electronic records from the hotel indicated he returned to his room by himself early Saturday. Monteith's death recalled the lives of Heath Ledger, Corey Haim and River Phoenix - actors who battled substance abuse and died in their 20s and 30s. Monteith had talked bluntly about struggling with addiction since he was a teenager, calling it a serious problem and telling Parade magazine in 2011 he was "lucky to be alive." Monteith admitted himself to a treatment facility in April for substance addiction, a representative said at the time. He also received treatment when he was 19. Gia Milani, who recently produced and directed a Canadian film featuring Monteith, this week said he "seemed healthy" when she last saw him four weeks ago in Los Angeles. "He looked super fit and he was energetic and excited," Milani said. She said Monteith showed no signs of a substance abuse problem while shooting the film a year ago.

Stevie Wonder is boycotting Florida
Want to see Stevie Wonder perform in Florida again? Better write your congressman. In the wake of this weekend's George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin not guilty ruling, the legendary singer has announced he will boycott Florida until the state's Stand Your Ground laws are erased. "I decided today that until the Stand Your Ground law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again," Wonder said during a concert Sunday in Quebec City, according to the Hollywood Reporter. "As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world." Countless artists have voiced their support for Martin's family since Zimmerman was ruled not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter on Saturday, including Beyonce, Rihanna and Solange. But Wonder's announcement is the strongest statement yet from an entertainer. He hasn't performed in Tampa Bay in years, and now it looks like that won't change anytime soon. "The truth is that - for those of you who've lost in the battle for justice, wherever that fits in any part of the world - we can't bring them back," he said during the Quebec City show.
