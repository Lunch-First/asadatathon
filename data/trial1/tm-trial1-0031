<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO, Fla. - Four of the jurors in the George Zimmerman trial distanced themselves late Tuesday from statements that another juror made in a televised interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four jurors issued a brief statement on court stationary saying the opinions expressed by Juror B37 to CNN Monday night are not representative of their views. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The opinions of Juror B-37, expressed on the Anderson Cooper show were her own, and not in any way representative of the jurors listed below,&quot; said the statement, signed by Jurors B51, B76, E6 and E40.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 said the actions of Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch volunteer, and Trayvon Martin both led to the teenager's fatal shooting last year, but that Zimmerman didn't break any law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four other jurors said in their statement that Martin's death weighed on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Serving on this jury has been a highly emotional and physically draining experience for each of us,&quot; the statement said. &quot;The death of a teenager weighed heavily on our hearts but in the end we did what the law required us to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interview came two days after the jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of Martin in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. Martin was black, and Zimmerman is Hispanic. Zimmerman was not arrested for 44 days, and the delay in charging him led to protests from those who believed race was a factor in the handling of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the CNN interview, Juror B37 said she didn't believe Zimmerman followed Martin, 17, because of his race. She said Zimmerman made some mistakes but that she believed Martin struck Zimmerman first and that Zimmerman had a right to defend himself.</SPAN></P>
