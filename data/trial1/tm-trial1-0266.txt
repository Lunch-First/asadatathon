GEORGE ZIMMERMAN'S parents are praying for TrayvonMartin.
Gladys and Robert Zimmerman told ABC News' Barbara Walters that they are struggling to cope with their new life in the aftermath of their son's acquittal in the fatal shooting of the unarmed 17-year-old. 
"We are deeply sorry for this tragedy. We pray for TrayvonMartin," Gladys said, speaking publicly Monday for the first time since the controversial weekend verdict.
Robert Zimmerman said that the family is terrified of the hostility that has been directed at them.
"We've had an enormous amount of death threats," he said.
"There's nothing I can tell (the people making the threats)," Gladys Zimmerman added. "But I can pray for them."
The Zimmermans strongly defended their son, a neighborhood watchman in his community in Sanford, Fla., who has been derided as a racist, wanna-be cop eager to challenge a black teen he assumed was up to no good.
"He's not a racist. He wasn't taught to be a racist," the father said of his son.
Gladys Zimmerman even sought to explain her son's lack of emotion in the courtroom.
"What you see is a composed person. That's what you will see in all my kids," she said, refuting the insinuation that her son is an unstable wacko.
She revealed to Walters she hasn't spoken much with her 29-year-old son since the verdict, because he fears someone would eavesdrop on their phone conversations.
