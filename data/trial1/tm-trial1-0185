<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A million Americans have heaped pressure on the nation's first black Attorney-General by demanding that the killer of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin be prosecuted for a hate crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Eric Holder prepared for a televised address to civil rights leaders last night, a petition calling for George Zimmerman, the acquitted Neighbourhood Watch volunteer, to face federal charges was winning support across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weekend protests are planned in 100 US cities. In Los Angeles, 13 people were arrested during a second night of riots. Shops, cars and businesses had windows broken, traffic was blocked and passers-by assaulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the jurors yesterday acknowledged the depth of pain that the verdict had caused America. The middle-aged mother of two revealed that half the six-strong panel - five white and one Hispanic, all of them women - initially wanted to convict Mr Zimmerman of second-degree murder or manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after 16 hours of wrangling they agreed that he had not acted out of hatred, and that his use of deadly force was justified. &quot;If he felt threatened, then his life was going to be taken away from him or he's going to have bodily harm, then he had a right [to shoot],&quot; the woman, known as Juror B37, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, who lived in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, wrongly assumed that Trayvon was &quot;up to no good&quot; and reported him to police as &quot;suspicious&quot; and a &quot;f***ing punk&quot; after seeing the black, hoodiewearing boy in his neighbourhood on the night of February 26 last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, 17, was unarmed and on his way to his father's girlfriend's house. A fight ensued, ending with the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror, who once held a concealed weapon permit, said: &quot;Both of them are responsible for the situation they got themselves into. I think both of them could have walked away.&quot; She announced plans for a book on Monday, but said yesterday a public petition had caused her to change her mind.</SPAN></P>
