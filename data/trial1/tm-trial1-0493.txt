NEW YORK (AP) - Vigils in 100 cities are being planned for Saturday over the verdict in the Trayvon Martin killing.
The Rev. Al Sharpton says his organization will hold prayer vigils and rallies will be held in front of federal buildings. Sharpton joins the NAACP and others calling for federal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman, who was acquitted in Martin's 2012 shooting death in Florida.
Largely peaceful rallies were held Sunday in cities across the country. There were some arrests in Los Angeles, where more than 100 police officers in riot gear converged on a crowd of about 80 protesters.
Sharpton has urged peace, saying any violence would mar Martin's name.
