WASHINGTON (AP) Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is offering her prayers for the family of Trayvon Martin and, in her words, "every family who loves someone who is lost to violence." 
Clinton says this week has brought "deep, painful heartache" to many Americans.
She says no mother or father should ever have to fear for a child walking down a street in the United States.
Clinton, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, discussed the case briefly during a speech Tuesday at the 51st national convention of a historically black women"s sorority, Delta Sigma Theta. They are her first public comments on the slaying since George Zimmerman"s acquittal.
The Justice Department has said it"s considering whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.
