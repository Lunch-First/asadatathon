JUROR RETHINK
ONE of six women jurors who cleared George Zimmerman of murdering unarmed teen Trayvon Martin has scrapped plans for a book about the trial. 
It came as US Attorney-General Eric Holder called today for a rethink of stand-your-ground laws.
Female juror B-37 said she had been shielded from public ``pain'' over the case as a juror, but after seeing the public mood since Zimmerman's acquittal she had decided not to go ahead with the memoir.
``I realise it was necessary for our jury to be sequestered . . . but that isolation shielded me from the depth of pain that exists among the general public,'' she said.
