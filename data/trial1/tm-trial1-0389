<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama last week suspended the Affordable Care Act's employer mandate, which requires employers with 50 or more workers to offer health care coverage. Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer believes the president violated the Constitution, which requires the president to uphold the law. He says it's unconstitutional for the administration to announce it won't enforce a key provision of an existing law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you think Obama's move suspending the Affordable Care Act's employer mandate is unconstitutional? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes: 1,253 (92 percent) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No: 105 (8 percent) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KQV runs two polls simultaneously, one from Internet users, the other from telephone callers. The nonscientific polls often do not reflect the same results. KQV updates its results from time to time, so the results on its website may vary from these results. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's question </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department says it is looking into the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges against former neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Over the weekend, a Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and other charges. Civil rights organizations have been holding rallies and vigils across the country protesting the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you believe the Justice Department should file criminal civil rights charges against Zimmerman for the shooting death of Martin? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes: Call 412-333-9190 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No: Call 412-333-9192 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final results can be heard on KQV-AM (1410) at 6:58 p.m. </SPAN></P>
