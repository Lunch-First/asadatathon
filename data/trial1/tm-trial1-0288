<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been a rough couple of days for Angela Corey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state attorney for the 4th Judicial Circuit, which covers Duval, Nassau, and Clay counties, has been criticized throughout the country for failure to convict George Zimmerman in 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death in Sanford. The governor appointed her as a special prosecutor in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A six-member jury found Zimmerman not guilty on counts of second-degree murder and lesser charges Saturday, setting off widespread outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal is a rare high-profile failure for Corey, and she will struggle with the perceptions this case generated, said former 4th Circuit Public Defender Bill White. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She doesn't take criticism well, and there's going to be a lot of second guessing,&quot; White said. &quot;But Angela will have her difficulties and she'll have to deal with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey, a conservative Republican, is in the odd situation of being blasted nationally by right-wing talk show hosts and columnists who say the decision to charge Zimmerman was politically motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the hall of shame goes Angela Corey, the prosecutor brought in to get an indictment,&quot; wrote conservative Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin. &quot;She proceeded to overcharge, grandstand and personify abuse of prosecutorial discretion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz called for Corey to be disbarred, saying she submitted affidavits that bordered on perjury and violated all kinds of rules of the profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She was among the most irresponsible prosecutors I've seen in 50 years of litigating cases,&quot; Dershowitz said on Fox News. &quot;And believe me, I've seen good prosecutors, bad prosecutors, but rarely have I seen one as bad as this prosecutor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locally, veteran Corey watchers say the acquittal is not the end of her time as a compelling figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will blow over,&quot; said former Mayor John Delaney, who was once Corey's boss at the State Attorney's Office. &quot;[Former Mayor and State Attorney] Ed Austin lost some high-profile cases, but it never damaged his reputation in the long run.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same will be true of Corey, said Delaney, now president of the University of North Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She will have little time to reflect on the outcome as another highly sensitive trial with racial connotations approaches. A pretrial hearing will occur at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday for Michael David Dunn, 46, who is accused of killing 17-year-old Jordan Davis in a dispute over loud music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Dunn, who is white, shot into a Dodge Durango with four teens in a dispute about loud music. Only Davis, who is black, was hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A trial is tentatively scheduled for September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey did not respond to requests for an interview with the Times-Union. She spoke to First Coast News, the Times-Union's news partner, and rejected suggestions that Zimmerman was overcharged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't charge based on what the verdict is going to be,&quot; Corey said. &quot;We charged what we think we can prove under the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COREY'S WEAKNESS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another interview with ABC News, she defended the decision to charge Zimmerman without going to a grand jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything went to trial and everything was public,&quot; Corey said. &quot;Shame on those who are bashing us for the sake of getting on TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Michael Hallett, head of UNF's criminal justice department, said this case exposed Corey's weaknesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My only thought is that Angela Corey lost the biggest case of her career by overcharging the suspect,&quot; Hallett said. &quot;But that's what she does all the time, and that will end up being her legacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited the Cristian Fernandez case as another example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fernandez was a 12-year-old boy accused of killing his 2-year-old half-brother. Corey sought to try him for first-degree murder as an adult, leading to an international outcry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He eventually pleaded guilty to manslaughter and received juvenile sanctions. He will be released from juvenile custody in January 2018, when he turns 19 and will be evaluated and treated for any psychological troubles and must also continue his education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Hank Coxe, who represented Fernandez, said he couldn't comment on Zimmerman, but his client was &quot;grossly overcharged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When overcharging happens, two things result: a loss of credibility with jurors, the judiciary and the community; and unwarranted, serious damage occurs to people,&quot; Coxe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman prosecution has also focused attention on Marissa Alexander, 32, currently serving a 20-year sentence after having fired what she said was a warning shot to protect herself from her abusive husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander cited the Stand Your Ground law to justify firing a shot that prosecutors said endangered her husband and two of her children. But that defense was rejected by the judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'SOMETHING WRONG'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown compared the two cases Monday and said it was incomprehensible that Alexander is in jail while Zimmerman gets to go free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is something wrong with the system,&quot; she said. &quot;The laws have to be revamped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not completely over as civil rights violations and a lawsuit are expected to be pursued next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hallett said the prosecution could have won a manslaughter conviction if they'd focused on that in the Zimmerman case, but they fixated on second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delaney said it's common practice to seek the highest possible charge. He also said it was ridiculous to suggest that Corey and lead prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda didn't know what they were doing when they have been prosecutors in murder cases for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those are two of the best and most experienced prosecutors in the state,&quot; Delaney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White, the former public defender, agreed that Zimmerman was overcharged but said that has become common in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know why it was a surprise that the state attorney overcharged someone,&quot; White said. &quot;I think any defense attorney would tell you that happens all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEXT UP, CIVIL RIGHTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Department of Justice said it would review the case for possible violations of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric Holder had begun the investigation last year into whether the deadly confrontation between George Zimmerman, 29, and Martin, 17, was motivated by racial profiling, but he stepped aside to let the trial in a Florida court proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the feds opened the door Sunday to reopening the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction and whether federal prosecution is appropriate,&quot; the Justice Department said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who was in hiding and fearing for his life after the verdict, will also likely face a civil lawsuit brought by Martin's parents.</SPAN></P>
