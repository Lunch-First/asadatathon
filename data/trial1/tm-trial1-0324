<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though there's no clear consensus here on the George Zimmerman verdict, Lancaster County legal experts agree that politics seem to have played an important role in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A criminal court is for facts and evidence, not questions of race and prejudice, legal experts here said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the entire matter was politically motivated,&quot; veteran defense lawyer Barry Goldman said Monday morning. &quot;Criminal cases aren't meant to be political statements.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman this weekend of murder and manslaughter charges in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood-watch volunteer, shot Martin, an unarmed, black teenager, after the two became engaged in a struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury's decision has prompted protests and demonstrations, with some saying the shooting and verdict were racially motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local professionals call Martin's death tragic, but several said the charges lodged against Zimmerman were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The burden of proof in criminal cases is high, so this verdict seemed extremely likely in light of the circumstances,&quot; District Attorney Craig Stedman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many here say the crux of the case - which they say was not proven in court - rested on whether Zimmerman or Martin escalated the confrontation that led to the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think anyone could positively say what started it,&quot; said defense attorney Jeff Conrad, a former prosecutor. &quot;It's a critical piece to whether this was self-defense or murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Goldman: &quot;There had to be a belief on the jury's part that an altercation had occurred and Zimmerman was getting the worst of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors sought a guilty verdict for second-degree murder, a charge, experts here say, that was likely brought because of the influence of outside pressures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought from the beginning that the fact that the state's attorney initially decided not to pursue charges, and that homicide charges were only filed in response to political pressure, was a sign that the case was weak,&quot; said defense attorney Edwin Pfursich, also a former prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Steven Breit said Zimmerman was &quot;overcharged&quot; from the start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was merely a homicide - with a self-defense claim - which prosecutors didn't prove,&quot; Breit said on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some locals said police and prosecutors might even have allowed media reports to influence them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We see a lot of things that we may not like,&quot; Conrad said. &quot;But that's not the impetus for charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, several locals said the verdict doesn't vindicate Zimmerman's behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to remember that &quot;not guilty&quot; does not necessarily mean the jury found that Zimmerman acted perfectly or was 100 perfect innocent,&quot; Stedman said, &quot;just that the state could not prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Christopher Lyden said prosecutors should have focused on disproving Zimmerman's self-defense claim from the start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought the prosecution presented a weak case,&quot; said Lyden, who has litigated several homicide cases here. &quot;They could have disproved self-defense by showing that Zimmerman provoked the fight, but failed to do so in a convincing way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Goldman: &quot;You can't be the aggressor and benefit from self-defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldman went on to say that if Zimmerman approached Martin, that doesn't mean Zimmerman surrenders his self-defense rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldman provided a hypothetical situation: If someone walks to a parking lot and finds someone leaning on their car, he or she has the right to tell that person to get off. If a struggle ensues and the car owner doesn't have a safe route to retreat, he or she is allowed to defend themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly, each side had a role in that confrontation. When Trayvon is on top, (Zimmerman's) duty to retreat no longer applies,&quot; Goldman said. &quot;The fact that (Martin) was unarmed had nothing to do with it. I can be threatened to death by someone's bare hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors told the six Florida jurors in opening statements that they wanted a murder conviction. Later in the trial, they asked the jury to consider manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Martin was killed on Feb. 26, 2012, prosecutors initially balked at charging Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norman Wolfinger, the Florida state's attorney, determined that charges were not appropriate. Perhaps giving in to pressure from civil rights groups, Florida's governor appointed a special prosecutor to review the case. She decided to charge Zimmerman with second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a perfect example of how prosecutors need to take politics out of the courtroom,&quot; Conrad said. &quot;What drives a charge is evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
