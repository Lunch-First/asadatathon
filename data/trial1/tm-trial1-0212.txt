SANFORD: US President Barack Obama has appealed to Americans for restraint amid anger from civil rights activists and public protests against the acquittal of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager. 
A Florida jury comprising six women - reportedly five white and a hispanic - on Sunday found neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering TrayvonMartin, after a long and racially-charged trial.
Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second-degree murder, having pursued Martin, 17, through a gated community in the town of Sanford, eventually shooting him during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, 2012.
The trial aroused strong passions and divided those who believed that Zimmerman - whose father is white and mother is Peruvian - had racially-profiled Martin, and those who believed he acted in self-defence.
Protests broke out in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta following the verdict, though they were mostly peaceful. A large demonstration in New York yesterday attracted thousands of people, with placards that read, ``Jail racist killers, not black youth'', and ``We are all Trayvon. The whole damn system is guilty''.
But, Obama, the first black US president, urged people to accept the trial verdict.
``We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,'' Obama said.
``I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.''
In Oakland, California, protesters smashed windows and spray-painted cars after the verdict was announced live on television.
Martin's parents - father Tracy and mother Sybrina Fulton - had before the trial asked the public to respect the outcome.
The Martin family's lawyer, Benjamin Crump, declined to say whether they would file a civil lawsuit against Zimmerman, but said ``they are going to certainly look at that as an option''.
