SANFORD: US President Barack Obama has appealed to Americans for restraint amid anger from civil rights activists and public protests against the acquittal of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager. 
A Florida jury of six women -- reportedly five white and one Hispanic --on the weekend found neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering TrayvonMartin, after a long and racially charged trial that transfixed much of the US for weeks.
Mr Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second-degree murder, having pursued Trayvon, 17, through a gated community in the town of Sanford, eventually shooting him during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, 2012.
The trial aroused strong passions and divided those who believed that Mr Zimmerman -- whose father is white and mother is Peruvian -- had racially profiled Trayvon, and those who believed he acted in self-defence.
Spontaneous protests broke out in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta overnight, following the verdict, though they were mostly peaceful.
Yesterday, a large demonstration in New York attracted several thousand people, with placards that read: ``Jail racist killers, not black youth'' and ``We are all Trayvon. The whole damn system is guilty.''
One of the marchers in lower Manhattan wore a T-shirt proclaiming: ``I'm black. Please don't shoot?''
However, Mr Obama, the first black US president, urged people to accept the trial verdict.
``We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,'' Mr Obama said in a statement.
``I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.''
Earlier in Oakland, California, protesters had smashed windows and spray-painted cars after the verdict was announced live
on television.
Mr Obama had spoken sombrely on Trayvon before, noting that if he had a son he would ``look like Trayvon''.
