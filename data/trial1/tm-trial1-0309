<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FROM New York to California, outrage over the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager has poured from street demonstrations and church pulpits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters called for justice for the victim and demanded federal civil rights charges against the neighbourhood watch volunteer who killed him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida case has unleashed a national debate over racial profiling, self-defence and equal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, the Justice Department said it was looking into the case to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman has been acquitted in the state case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, the Justice Department said the criminal section of its civil rights division, the FBI and the US Attorney's office for the Middle District of Florida were evaluating evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama called the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin a tragedy for the country and urged calm reflection, a message shared by religious and civil rights leaders hoping to ensure peaceful demonstrations in the wake of a case that became an emotional flash point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Manhattan, congregants at Middle Collegiate Church were encouraged to wear hooded sweatshirts in memory of Martin, who was wearing a hoodie the night he was shot to death in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Reverend Jacqueline Lewis urged peace and told her congregation that slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr ``would have wanted us to conduct ourselves on the highest plane of dignity''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she added: ``We're going to raise our voices against the root causes of this kind of tragedy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders, including Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, urged peace in the wake of the verdict. Jackson said the legal system ``failed justice'', but violence wasn't the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not all the protesters heeded those calls. In Oakland, California, some angry demonstrators broke windows, burned US flags and started street fires. Some marchers also vandalised a police squad car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most protests were peaceful, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Manhattan's Union Square, hundreds of people gathered to voice their passions over the verdict while holding images of Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some tempered their anger, saying they didn't contest the jury's decision based on the legal issues involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ``while the verdict may be legal, a system that doesn't take into account what happened is a broken legal system'', Harlem resident Jennifer Lue said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Everyone should feel about this, whether you're Asian-American or African-American,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
