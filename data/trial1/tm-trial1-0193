<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called Tuesday for a re-examination of &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws that expand the right to self-defense in the wake of George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods,&quot; Holder told a national convention of the NAACP. &quot;These laws try to fix something that was never broken. There has always been a legal defense for using deadly force if -- and the 'if' is important -- no safe retreat is available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida is one of more than two dozen states that have stand your ground laws. They allow people to defend themselves with lethal force without first attempting to retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder also repeated his pledge on Monday to conduct  a thorough investigation into the Feb. 26, 2012, shooting of the 17-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Sanford, Fla., jury found Zimmerman, 29, not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, claimed Trayvon had attacked him and he shot the teen in self-defense. State prosecutors said Zimmerman profiled and murdered Trayvon, then lied about the teen initiating the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal investigation into the death was opened last year and prosecutors from the Justice Department's civil rights division will review evidence from the FBI and the Florida criminal trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAACP leader Benjamin Jealous has urged the Justice Department to file civil rights charges against Zimmerman. To bring a civil rights case, the department must show evidence that Zimmerman killed the youth because he was African American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder said that after Trayvon's death, he talked to his teen son about how to interact with police and others as a black man. He said his own father had the same talk with him. &quot;I had to do this to protect my boy,&quot; Holder said. &quot;We must confront the underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs, and unfortunate stereotypes that serve too often as the basis for police action and private judgments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sharp contrast to that view, Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., said in a radio interview Tuesday: &quot;We're hung up on this one case, where this one fellow was, in fact, found not guilty by a jury. That's the way the American law system works. Get over it.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
