<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More trouble for BBC talent show The Voice after &quot;coach&quot; Danny O'Donoghue, right, announced he was leaving the X Factor rival to go on tour with his band The Script. His exit follows that of Jessie J, and it remains to be seen whether fellow coaches Will.i.am and Sir Tom Jones agree to stick around for a third series. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the killing of Trayvon Martin, Stevie Wonder is boycotting the state of Florida because of its &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law. &quot;Wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alice Cooper says bands such as Mumford &amp; Sons, need more red meat before they can claim to be rockers. &quot;This whole generation needs to eat steak,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe they just need to quit eating vegetarian food and get out there and get some blood pumping in their systems.&quot; He should invite them to his restaurant Alice Cooperstown, where they serve &quot;a full pound, 22-inch Vienna Beef hot dog served on a whole baguette&quot;.</SPAN></P>
