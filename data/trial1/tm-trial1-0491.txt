Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z brought London's Wireless festival to a rousing close with a spectacular joint set.
Rihanna, fresh from her performance at T in the Park, appeared as a surprise guest, joining the duo for a rendition of Run This Town. 
Timberlake and Jay-Z, who already headlined on previous nights, took to the stage together, billed as Legends Of The Summer, and gave festival goers a preview of their north American stadium tour of the same name.
Opening with their single Holy Grail, their set, which lasted for two-and-a-half hours, was a combination of their solo hits and a mash-up of their popular tracks as well as their collaborations, Suit And Tie and Holy Grail. Timberlake, 32, did double duty, playing the piano and guitar during Jay-Z's songs.
"You know we love London," he said, as Jay-Z added: "We appreciate the love."
The 43-year-old rapper - whose real name is Shawn Carter - also thanked the crowds for "making Magna Carta my first number one album in the UK," adding: "Rest in peace Trayvon Martin," in reference to the shot US teenager.
A Tribe Called Quest dedicated their first UK show in 20 years to him, after George Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder by a Florida jury.
The US hip-hop pioneers - Q-Tip (Jonathan Taylor), Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor) and Ali Shaheed Muhammad - reunited to bring a touch of the old-school to the three-day music festival.
"I don't want to be a downer but yesterday (Saturday) in America, we saw a miscarriage of justice," said Q-Tip, before putting out a call for peace.
"It's not the first time this has happened. Pray for us... we need help," he added.
