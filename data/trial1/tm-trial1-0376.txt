OROVILLE   A group of people wanted to spread the message of love around Oroville on Monday, but didn't want to take credit for it, according to a group representative, contacted by the newspaper. 
The "O" on Table Mountain had letters added to spell "LOVE." Signs proclaiming "Love" hung from the railroad trestle on Oro Dam Boulevard and the Nelson Avenue overpass bridge.
A representative of the group that crafted the messages said with all the bad things going on today, including the Trayvon Martin issue, it wanted to spread the message of love, but anonymously.
The group that posted the messages began a movement more than a year ago to encourage loving and accepting yourself and others.
