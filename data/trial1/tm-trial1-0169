<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The controversially concluded Florida murder trial of George Zimmerman has prompted fresh debate over whether &quot;stand your ground&quot; self-defense laws hinder violence or, perversely, propel it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence appears mixed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some studies show enhanced public safety. Others suggest the opposite. One study concluded that several dozen men a month are killed as a consequence of the laws. In a speech this week, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder showed himself to be among the skeptics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resulting ambiguity, like the Zimmerman trial itself, in which he was found not guilty of murdering 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, may confound anyone hoping for a neutral finding of fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's good that whatever perspective you take is based on data, and not just anecdotes,&quot; Miami-based attorney Leigh-Ann Buchanan said in an interview on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buchanan is a co-chair of an American Bar Association task force that's studying stand-your-ground laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, Holder joined those who assert that the stand-your-ground laws make matters worse. Addressing the NAACP on Tuesday in Orlando, Fla., he declared that the laws may &quot;contribute to more violence than they prevent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By allowing and perhaps encouraging violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety,&quot; the nation's top law enforcement officer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general thrust of such laws is to remove the long-standing legal &quot;duty to retreat&quot; in the face of danger while in a public place. Instead, individuals may defend themselves, with lethal force if necessary, so long as they are in the public place legally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's attorneys didn't specifically raise the stand-your-ground law as a defense against second-degree murder charges in the February 2012 death of Martin. The trial judge, though, did refer to the &quot;right to stand your ground,&quot; under certain circumstances, in her instructions to the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, two Georgia State University economics researchers concluded that the laws are &quot;associated with a significant increase in the number of homicides among whites, especially white males.&quot; In a 55-page paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, authors Chandler McClellan and Erdal Tekin estimated that &quot;between 28 and 33 additional white males are killed each month&quot; as a result of these laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These laws are also associated with a significant increase in emergency room visits and hospital discharges related to firearm-inflicted injuries,&quot; the Georgia State economists said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas A&amp;M researchers Mark Hoekstra and Cheng Cheng reached similar conclusions last year in a 43-page study that found a &quot;statistically significant 8 percent net increase in the number of reported murders and non-negligent manslaughters&quot; in states with the enhanced self-defense laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases, though, the resulting violence is considered justified. In these cases, advocates say, the laws result in a safer society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private citizens committed 196 justifiable homicides nationwide in 2005, the year states began crafting stand-your-ground laws, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting system. The FBI defines justifiable homicide as &quot;the killing of a felon, during the commission of a felony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 2011, the number of reported justifiable homicides had jumped to 260.</SPAN></P>
