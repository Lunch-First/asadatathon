<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reacting to the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict, President Obama was kind of classy - but the New York City mayoral munchkins, not so much. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We are a nation of laws,&quot; said the president over the weekend, &quot;and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wise words. Sound counsel.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sure, Obama gave the racial resentment pot a mighty stir shortly after the fight that left Martin - who was black - dead and George Zimmerman - a Hispanic deemed &quot;white&quot; in the media narrative - charged with murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; said our president, unhelpfully. But he had re-election to win, and an electorate to energize - and a politician's gotta do what a politician's gotta do. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The same instinct clearly was at work in New York Saturday night: When the Florida jury deemed Zimmerman not guilty of the crimes charged, a wash of corrosive rhetoric poured from the city's mayoral aspirants.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To wit: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was killed because he was black. There was no justice done today in Florida,&quot; said William Thompson, who is himself African-American - and who also knows better, as we shall see. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l City Council Speaker Christine Quinn (D-Manhattan) termed the verdict &quot;a shocking insult&quot; - adding, nonsensically, &quot;We must also put an end to a culture that presumes any young man of color . . . is looking to commit a crime simply because he was walking down the street.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l And Anthony Weiner broadcast a decidedly contradictory message, finding the verdict &quot;deeply unsatisfying,&quot; but noting &quot;trial by jury is our only choice in a democracy.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was more, but it amounted to nothing - except for Republican John Catsimatidis' absolutely spot-on observation: &nbsp;&quot;When you have safe streets, tragedies like this don't happen.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Without fully rehashing the Martin-Zimmerman case, it should be noted that the Sanford, Fla., police department isn't very efficient; burglaries there were both rampant and largely a black enterprise; a neighborhood watch was formed - and presently the fatal encounter occurred. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Zimmerman, the jury found, was acting within the law right up to the conclusion of the fight; Martin, essentially, was the victim of cruel circumstance - and of Florida burglars unnamed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet to extend Catsimatidis' thought, when you have safe streets people accept them as a fact of life - and there's scant appreciation of the need to keep them safe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In New York City, that debate revolves around the NYPD's use of so-called &quot;stop-and-frisk&quot; - essentially an aggressive police presence in high-crime neighborhoods.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's been an astonishingly successful approach: Cops look for violent criminals where violent crime occurs, one result being that New York is the safest big city in America.&nbsp;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it's also controversial: A lot of people resent what they term the stigmatizing attention it brings to certain precincts - and so it has become a major pander point in the mayoral campaign.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Interestingly, Thompson seems to get it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I'm the one who has to worry about my son being stopped and frisked,&quot; he said earlier this year. &quot;But I'm worried also about my son being shot by someone who's a member of a gang in the street.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And worried he should be. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some 97 percent of the city's shooters last year were black or Hispanic, according to the NYPD - as were fully 96 percent of its shooting victims. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such numbers - indeed, street-crime stats right across the board - speak loudly to social dislocations that run deep in the city. The same pathologies - not to put too fine a point on it - threaten not only public safety, but also the stability of the city's public schools, among other things.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the fact that none of this is even a small part of the 2013 mayoral discussion is profoundly disturbing. Alas, it's much easier to sacrifice yet another generation to false pride and cheap electoral opportunism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Certainly, the candidates had an opportunity Saturday night. They all spoke nonsense, save for John Catsimatidis - who has no chance of becoming mayor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What a sad, shallow bunch. </SPAN></P>
