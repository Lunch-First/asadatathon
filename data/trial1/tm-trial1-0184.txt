Stevie Wonder says he won't perform in Florida and other states with a "stand your ground" law. 
In a video posted on YouTube, the 63-year-old singer said at a concert in Quebec City on Sunday "that until the 'stand your ground' law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again." Wonder added: "Wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world."
The law allows people to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger.
