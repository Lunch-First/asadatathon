<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROTESTS are continuing to spread across the US -- with at least one turning violent -- following the not-guilty verdict for George Zimmerman after he shot teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin dead . </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrations, from Florida where the trial took place to Atlanta, DC, and New York, remained peaceful last night -- although violence erupted in Oakland, California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, a hotbed of racial tension, some protesters turned violent -- vandalising police cars, breaking windows and setting fire to garbage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One photo from the protests in the city shows men dousing an American flag in lighter fluid and setting it alight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least three separate protests were scheduled for New York City -- one in lower Manhattan, one in Harlem and a third in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oakland demonstration followed a raucous but largely peaceful rally in San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict also sparked protests in Los Angeles, where demonstrators gathered in Leimert Park, the city's historically black neighbourhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police were put on tactical alert, but there were no reports of any arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celebrities continued to address the verdict, with pop superstar Beyonce stopping her Mrs Carter Show World Tour concert at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, to honour the slain teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her concert started about 30 minutes after the Zimmerman verdict began to circulate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I'd like to have a moment of silence for Trayvon,'' the pop star said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyonce then sang the chorus of Dolly Parton's I Will Always Love You, before transitioning into her hit Halo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow celeb Rihanna took to Twitter to express her celebrity outrage, tweeting, 'This is the saddest news ever!!! #whatsjustice.'</SPAN></P>
