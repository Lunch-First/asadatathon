<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday called the killing of Trayvon Martin a tragic, unnecessary shooting, and said the Justice Department will follow the facts and the law as it reviews evidence to see whether federal criminal charges are warranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department is examining evidence in the case and testimony from the state trial to determine whether criminal civil rights charges would be brought. However, legal experts said Justice officials would likely be saddled with some of the same challenges that complicated the unsuccessful state case. The key to charging Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, lies in whether evidence exists that he was motivated by racial animosity to kill Martin. </SPAN></P>
