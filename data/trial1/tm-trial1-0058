<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During my eight decades on this third rock from the sun, I have been in cities and rural areas in all 50 states and on six continents and have never been faced with a need to violently defend myself beyond a fist to the nose of a bully. Those occasions were in my teens. The only times I have felt afraid was when a couple of my law-abiding Rambo wannabe friends bragged about their &quot;packing (licensed) heat.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beginning at about age 12, I hunted with a .22 rifle and a 12-gauge shotgun. There were three un-breakable rules (which many people seem to ignore these days): never point a gun at anything or anyone you don't intend to shoot, never take a loaded gun in the house and always assume that all guns are loaded.<BR><BR><BR><BR> While serving 3 c years in the U.S. Army (post Korean War) I qualified with all of the late '50s individual weapons and several crew-served weapons. It is sad to see how many current activists, politicians and talking-heads haven't even bothered to learn the difference between automatic and semi-automatic weapons. Nor between a clip and a magazine. Probably 95 percent of the pistols and rifles produced since 1940 are semi-automatic. Defining an &quot;assault&quot; weapon by appearance is totally meaningless. It is silly to defend the need for high capacity magazines for self-defense or hunting. If you can't hit a moving target during three or four shots, you should be quickly surrendering to your aggressor or giving up on your hunt.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Perhaps sane, non-felon Americans should have the right to keep and bear individual firearms, preferably openly rather than concealed. But the argument that the 2nd Amendment has anything to do with target practice, gun collecting, protecting oneself from muggers, stopping public massacres or game hunting is utter nonsense! Nor was it intended to defend against foreign invaders.<BR><BR><BR><BR> The 2nd Amendment was only intended for citizens to be able to collectively protect themselves from their own federal government. See Federalist No 46. It was written at a time when a preponderance of citizens armed with muskets could prevail over a federal (British) army which also depended on muskets and possessed only a small contingent of artillery.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Since then, most government-owned armies have acquired overwhelming firepower. The American Civil War proved for all time that the U.S. government could prevail over even a very large number of armed citizens and that brother can be persuaded to fire on brother -- literally!<BR><BR><BR><BR> The militia mentioned in the 2nd Amendment referred to state militias that reported to the state Governors. The state militias are no longer independent of the Federal government but became the National Guard, which has been under control of the President since the Militia Act of 1903.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Although it isn't going to happen, the 2nd Amendment should be intelligently debated and perhaps re-written to specifically cover those activities mentioned above.<BR><BR><BR><BR> By the way, if the law-abiding George Zimmerman had not elected to carry his legal handgun, he would probably have allowed the police to handle the suspicious Trayvon&nbsp;Martin or, at worst, would have survived with a broken nose, a scared scalp and an intact reputation. And he would have saved over $1 million in defense attorney fees. And how many millions of prosecuting attorney costs? And Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would still be alive.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Glenn Selch lives in Erie.  </SPAN></P>
