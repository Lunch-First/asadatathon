<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US President Barack Obama has appealed to Americans for restraint amid anger from civil rights activists and public protests against the acquittal of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury comprising six women -- reportedly five white and a hispanic -- late on Saturday found neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, after a long and racially-charged trial that transfixed much of the US for weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second-degree murder, having pursued Martin, 17, through a gated community in the town of Sanford, eventually shooting him during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial aroused strong passions and divided those who believed that Mr Zimmerman -- whose father is white and mother is Peruvian -- had racially-profiled Martin, and those who believed he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spontaneous protests broke out in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta overnight, following the verdict, although they were mostly peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, a large demonstration in New York attracted several thousand people, with placards that read, ``Jail racist killers, not black youth'', and ``We are all Trayvon. The whole damn system is guilty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr Obama, the first black US president, urged people to accept the trial verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,'' Mr Obama said in a statement. ``I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president tied the killing of the teenager to the problems surrounding gun use in the United States -- he had tried but failed to push through new control measures in the US congress earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this. As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honour Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,'' Mr Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Justice said on Sunday it continued to have an open investigation into the case, following the Florida trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction,'' it said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
