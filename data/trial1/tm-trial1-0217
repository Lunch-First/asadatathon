<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: By what authority does Alcoa enjoy the privilege to be the first corporation to announce quarterly and annual earnings?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---Chuck Ellet, Dunwoody</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Former Alcoa CEO Paul O'Neill implemented a system in the early 1990s in which the company could close its books several days &quot;faster, fully audited,&quot; than it had previously done. &quot;O'Neill gave then-Alcoa controller Earnest Edwards license to redesign our systems,&quot; Monica Orbe, the company's director of corporate affairs told Q&amp;A on the News in an email. The change took a year, she added, but the &quot;accelerated close freed up an enormous amount of analytical talent in finance.&quot; That allowed Alcoa to begin the quarterly earnings season, starting in 1996, according to the company's annual report that year. Alcoa is one of 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: I have been unable to find out, and have not heard, if Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a resident of the gated community where he was shot. If not, why was he there?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---Judy Michel, Alpharetta</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Martin lived in Miami Gardens, Fla., and attended Miami's Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, but was visiting The Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford, Fla., with his father, Tracy Martin. Tracy Martin's fiancee, Brandy Green, lived in the gated townhome complex, and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin reportedly had visited there several times. He was returning to Green's townhome after walking to a nearby convenience store when he was shot and killed on Feb. 26, 2012. Sanford is a suburb of Orlando, Fla.</SPAN></P>
