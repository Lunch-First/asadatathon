U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder should be mindful of his words on the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin case. His recent comments seem to give credibility to the opponents of the recent decision rendered by the Florida court. 
As a lawyer, and considering his position as attorney general, the man should be intimately aware of the facts and evidence in this case.
If he has not been so informed, this says little for his office. His remarks may just give false hope to those who wish to see another result.
This entire episode has been the result of poor judgment on the part of the two participants. Let's not extend this by giving false hope to those who want a different result and those who may be hurt or killed by those who seek a different ending.
