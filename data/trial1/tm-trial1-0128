<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO, Florida (AP) Four of the jurors at the George Zimmerman trial are distancing themselves from statements that another juror made in a televised interview. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four jurors issued a statement late Tuesday that the opinions expressed by Juror B37 to CNN&quot;s Anderson Cooper on Monday night are not representative of their views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say Juror B37 was only speaking for herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 said the actions of the neighborhood watch volunteer and Trayvon Martin both led to the teenager&quot;s fatal shooting last year, but that Zimmerman didn&quot;t actually break the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four jurors&quot; statement says Martin&quot;s death weighed heavily on their hearts and that the trial was physically draining for them. But they say they did what the law required them to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also made a request for privacy. The court has not released the names of the six-woman jury.</SPAN></P>
