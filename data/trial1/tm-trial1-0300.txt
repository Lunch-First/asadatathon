Musicians across the US paid tribute to TrayvonMartin this weekend after George Zimmerman was acquitted of his murder. Beyonce took the stage in Nashville 30 minutes after the jury in Florida returned with its ruling. She asked the audience to "have a moment of silence for Trayvon", then sang the chorus from I Will Always Love You. 
The following night, her husband, Jay-Z, paused during his final Wireless festival set, to say: "Rest in peace, TrayvonMartin." The rapper had previously criticised the coverage of Zimmerman's trial, complaining to Hot 97 that TV networks were reducing justice to "entertainment".
Also at Wireless, A Tribe Called Quest dedicated their set to Trayvon. "I don't want to be a downer but yesterday, in America, we saw a miscarriage of justice," Q-Tip said on Sunday. "It's not the first time this has happened. Pray for us . . . we need help."
Other musicians responded on Twitter to the verdict. "Shit (don't) change, and I may never get to see it do so. I pray 4my kids & yours," wrote Lil Wayne. "Bullshit!" tweeted Chris Brown. Rihanna called it "the saddest news ever", while Miley Cyrus said she felt "sick". "Black parents hug your sons right tonight. Let them know their value. This ain't a black or white thing this is a wrong and right thing," wrote Talib Kweli, while Solange Knowles suggested: "We have to somehow turn this anger & pain into peaceful productivity."
