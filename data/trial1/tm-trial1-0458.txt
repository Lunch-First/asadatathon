The acquittal of George Zimmerman on second-degree murder in the shooting of Trayvon Martin has sent the U.S. into another round of angry debate over race and the law. 
The Florida jury accepted that Zimmerman acted in self-defence but some African-Americans and their supporters see racism in the decision - that the case flows from a fear of young black men and a gun culture too quick to allow deadly force.
While the racial elements of the case are less of an issue in Canada, confusion around what constitutes legal self-defence has been a problem. It's why the Conservatives brought in legislation that took effect in March to clarify when, and to what extent, citizens can use force to protect themselves, others and property. The Citizen's Arrest and Self-defence Act amended the self-defence sections of the Criminal Code, which were so confusing that judges had trouble explaining them to juries, leading to appeals.
The new simplified "defence of the person" has three key elements: a person reasonably believes that force is being used against them or another person or is threatened; that the act of self-defence is committed for the purpose of defending or protecting themselves or the other person; and that their act committed is reasonable in the circumstances. It lists nine "factors" for lawyers, juries and judges to consider.
The new act also allows reasonable steps to protect property. It will still be up to the Crown, in whether to lay charges, and the courts, in whether to convict, to determine reasonable force, but the intent of the law is now more clear, which is a good thing.
