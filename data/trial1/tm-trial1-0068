<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami: Three jurors in George Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial initially favored convicting him of that offense or manslaughter, but the six-woman jury ultimately voted to acquit him in the killing of an unarmed black teenager after more closely examining the law, a juror in the case has said, reports AP. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch volunteer, was charged with second- degree murder in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin last year, but the jury also was allowed to consider manslaughter. The woman, known as Juror B37, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday that when the jury began deliberations Friday, they took an initial vote. Three jurors, including B37, were in favor of acquittal, two supported manslaughter and one backed seconddegree murder. She said the jury started going through all the evidence, listening to tapes multiple times.<BR><BR>&quot;That's why it took us so long,&quot; said B37, who said she planned to write a book about the trial but later had a change of heart. When they started looking at the law, the person who initially wanted second-degree murder changed her vote to manslaughter, the juror said. Then they asked for clarification from the judge and went over it again and again. B37 said some jurors wanted to find Zimmerman guilty of something, but there was just no place to go based on the law, B37 said jurors cried when they gave their final vote to the bailiff.<BR><BR>&quot;I want people to know that we put everything into everything to get this verdict,&quot; said the juror, whose face was blacked out during the televised interview but who appeared to become choked up. The interview came two days after the jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Martin in a gated community in Florida.</SPAN></P>
