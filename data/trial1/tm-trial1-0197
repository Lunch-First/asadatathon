<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevie Wonder is standing his ground in the wake of the death of Trayvon Martin. In a video posted on YouTube, the 63-year-old singer said at a concert in Quebec City  Sunday that he won't perform in Florida and other states with a &quot;stand your ground&quot; firearm self-defense law, which allows people to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger. George Zimmerman said he was defending himself when he shot the 17-year-old during a confrontation in Sanford, Fla., in February 2012. A jury acquitted Zimmerman late Saturday of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges.</SPAN></P>
