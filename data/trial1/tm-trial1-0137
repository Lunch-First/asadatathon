<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 2011, Monteith had revealed details about his substance-abuse problems, telling Parade mag that by age 13 he was skipping class to get drunk and stoned. He said he was fully &quot;out of control&quot; by the time he was 16.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monteith said that although he couldn't change his past, he felt it had helped him mature until he felt he could resist the temptations fame brought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I feel like I'm kind of Hollywood-proof,&quot; he said. &quot;Considering everything I've gone through, I feel like I've already been there and done that lifestyle to the nth degree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
