<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">I have new appreciation for our Port of Vancouver commissioners as they grapple with the idea of a crude oil terminal at the port. I don't know what they will decide, but I do know they are listening intently to people and experts, researching pros and cons, and will make the choice based on what they believe is best for the long-term health and benefits to our community.</SPAN></P>

The M&amp;M boys don't listen to anyone who has a different view, they ignore experts, and continuously put us at risk.</SPAN></P>

<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The July 15 story &quot;7,000 seniors fail to pass math exam&quot; reported the failures of statewide tests for high school graduation.</SPAN></P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">How can that many students complete 12 years of school, presumably earning passes, and be so deficient in basic subjects?</SPAN></P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Those deficiencies should have been identified long ago and either corrected or recognized as an insurmountable barrier to a diploma. I think it's the fault of the teachers and, if not, I'd like to know whom to blame -- and why.</SPAN></P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Columbia River Crossing supporters attempt to justify a project of such importance and magnitude with little more than lame catchphrases like &quot;jobs,&quot; &quot;the future&quot; and &quot;earthquakes&quot; that proved both embarrassingly unconvincing and politically feeble. Thankfully, the CRC is now gone and, with it, the impending threats of growth-constricting tolling and wasteful light rail, which project supporters so irresponsibly disregarded.</SPAN></P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Yet those politicians who urged this boondoggle's passage linger. Some currently hold office. Others aspire to it. All have demonstrated such poor judgment as to be unworthy of offices they either current hold, or seek to occupy. Please do not support them.</SPAN></P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">I read in the paper that some hoodlums had trashed a police car in Oakland, Calif. Let's see, Oakland is how far from Sanford, Fla., and the George Zimmerman trial? I feel that it is a matter of time before the other cities and states will be subjected to all kinds of riots and protests. Do you remember Rodney King?</SPAN></P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Now the federal Department of Justice is looking into filing civil rights charges against Zimmerman. Mark my words -- we are in for a very tough time. It is a racial matter, no two ways about it.</SPAN></P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Andrew Jackson named the party the &quot;Democratic Party&quot; and, for more than 180 years, it has remained the Democratic Party. However, since the days of President Dwight Eisenhower, many Republicans have tried to rename it the &quot;Democrat Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The late Arlie DeJarnatt was a Democratic Party member of both the House and the Senate of the Washington state Legislature. In the 1960s, both DeJarnatt and this writer taught U.S. history at Robert A. Long High School in Longview. DeJarnatt told me that Herbert Brownell Jr., Eisenhower's attorney general, told Republican leaders there would be political benefits if they always referred to the Democratic Party as the Democrat Party. Of course, there isn't such a thing as a &quot;Democrat&quot; Party.</SPAN></P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The Republican-dominated House of Representatives appears to want to balance the budget on the backs of the poor with cuts to food stamps, programs for the elderly, Social Security and Medicare.</SPAN></P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">They are hurting our students by increasing the interest on the loans students must take out to attend college. (By the way, in some countries the government actually pays for the students to go on to college.)</SPAN></P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Meanwhile, Republicans want to extend tax breaks to the extremely wealthy and to big business, all of this while they say they are doing the work of &quot;the people.&quot; Huh?</SPAN></P>

<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Jury's verdict was right</SPAN></P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">I was aghast when I read the July 14 story &quot;Zimmerman not guilty in slaying&quot; by Associated Press reporters Mike Schneider and Kyle Hightower regarding the George Zimmerman acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Their reporting implies that Zimmerman was guilty as they misrepresented the facts of the trial and also by referring to Trayvon Martin again as &quot;the unarmed black teenager.&quot; The story had an accompanying photo of Martin who was obviously a few years younger at the time. Martin, in all physical respects, was a young man who could have been a middleweight boxer.</SPAN></P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The real crime is that Zimmerman was charged with murder. The special prosecutor who filed these charges after all the other law enforcement agencies refused due to lack of probable cause should be disbarred, as was the infamous lead prosecutor Mike Nifong in the Duke University scandal several years ago. Erroneously claimed issues made that phony case of rape against members of Duke's lacrosse team an additional wedge in race relations as does this Zimmerman fiasco.</SPAN></P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Even with all the highly misstated evidence, the jury got it right.</SPAN></P>
