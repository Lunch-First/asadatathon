 VIGILS and rallies are to be held in 100 US cities this weekend to press for federal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman over the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, the Rev Al Sharpton said. 
The prominent civil rights activist announced the plan at a news conference with several church ministers outside the Justice Department in Washington. 
He did not say which cities would be involved, but did say the rallies and vigils will be staged on Saturday at federal buildings.
Zimmerman's acquittal over the weekend touched off protests around the country. The Justice Department is investigating whether he violated the black teenager's civil rights when he shot the 17-year-old during a confrontation in Sanford, Florida, in February last year.
The neighbourhood watch volunteer, 29, said he fired his gun in self-defence, and a jury acquitted him of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. 
Mr Sharpton was speaking after violence erupted on the West Coast during protests over the acquittal. In Los Angeles 13 people were arrested after a protest turned violent; at least one person was injured and police made nine arrests in violence in Oakland.
