<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moment neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old white Latino, shot black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin dead in February 2012 as he walked innocently to his father's home in Sanford, Fla., race and politics took centre stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing reverberated throughout the nation's black communities, whose members know only too well the harsh reality of racial profiling and that the justice system is rife with racial bias, as many studies have shown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these two ingredients were mixed into the judicial process, two other elements in the case retreated into the shadows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those ingredients, however, would prove pivotal: gun control and Florida's socalled &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, plus its related statutes on self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essentially, Zimmerman was able to shoot Martin because Florida law - and the law in most states - permits him to carry a concealed weapon and gave him the right to use that weapon to defend himself against grave bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem, however, is people can get it wrong. They can misinterpret the danger. Luckily for these shooters, the law also protects against that eventuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chaos of such defensive-force situations means that people commonly make mistakes,&quot; Paul Robinson, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, recently wrote in the Wall Street</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The law does not require that a person get it exactly right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It may be enough that the person honestly believed his force was necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman said he followed Martin because he thought he was a robber. When an angry Martin turned on him and began beating him up, Zimmerman shot him in self-defence. That's his story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police declared the shooting was indeed selfdefence, civil rights activists organized mass protests. The dark hoodie Martin wore that fateful night became a civil rights emblem. Federal and state politicians met with prosecutors and urged Zimmerman's arrest and prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing was hashed out in America's newsrooms. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and MSNBC host, travelled to Florida where he led protest marches. CNN and MSNBC claimed the tape of a 911 call made by Zimmerman &quot;clearly&quot; recorded him calling Martin a &quot;coon.&quot; NBC host Joe O'Donnell said the tape &quot;constitutes obvious evidence of hateful intent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN later retracted its statement, admitting that the tape did not contain any racial slur but rather the word &quot;cold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even U.S. President Barack Obama joined the fray. He announced to the nation, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Justice Department sent FBI investigators to gather evidence for possible prosecution of Zimmerman for federal civil rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No case was filed.</SPAN></P>
