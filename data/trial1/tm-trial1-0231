<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevie Wonder has declared he will not play any shows in Florida, following the verdict in the case of shot US teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Superstition star made his position clear during a gig in Quebec City on July 14, after George Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I decided today that until the Stand Your Ground law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again,&quot; he told the crowd. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 63-year-old added: &quot;The truth is that - for those of you who've lost in the battle for justice, wherever that fits in any part of the world - we can't bring them back. What we can do is we can let our voices be heard. And we can vote in our various countries throughout the world for change and equality for everybody. That's what I know we can do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevie is the latest music star to lend his voice to Martin's case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyonce dedicated a moment's silence to the teenager during a show in Nashville, while her husband Jay-Z made a reference during his closing Wireless set, saying: &quot;Rest in peace, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During their performance, US hip-hop pioneers A Tribe Called Quest also called for change, with Q-Tip calling it a &quot;miscarriage of justice&quot;.</SPAN></P>
