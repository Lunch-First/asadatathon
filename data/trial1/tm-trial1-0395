<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence for Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The defense showed photos of Zimmerman's bruised head and face, which were taken after his fight with Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* John Good, who lived at the housing complex where Martin was killed, testified he saw someone in dark clothes straddling someone wearing white or red who was lying on the ground.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Public safety consultant Dennis Root testified that Martin was in better shape than Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Forensics expert Vincent DiMaio testified that the trajectory of the bullet and gun powder on Martin's body support Zimmerman's account that Martin was on top of him when he fatally shot the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, passed in 2005, allows Zimmerman to defend himself and meet force with force (including deadly force) if he felt it was necessary to prevent bodily harm, death or an imminent felony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Anthony Gorgone, a crime lab analyst with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, testified that he found no traces of Zimmerman's DNA in scrapings taken from Martin's fingernails.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rachel Jeantel, 19, a friend of Martin's, spoke on the phone with Martin moments before he was killed and told the jury that Martin said he was being followed and tried to get away from the man pursuing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Florida Department of Law Enforcement analyst and firearms expert Amy Siewert testified that tearing and residue on Martin's clothing showed the gun was positioned directly against him when it fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Prosecutors said Zimmerman profiled Martin because of appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Prosecutors questioned how Zimmerman's skull have hit concrete 25 times, as he said, and sustained so few injuries and how Martin could have grabbed the gun and not left any DNA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial points</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Florida Supreme Court defines reasonable doubt as not merely possible doubt, speculative, imaginary or forced doubt. Jurors are told that if ? after carefully considering, comparing and weighing all the evidence, they do not have a stable, unwavering conviction of guilt, then the charge is not proved beyond every reasonable doubt and they must find the defendant not guilty because the doubt is reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Under the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guaranteed trial by a 12-member jury until the 1970 case Williams v. Florida, when it was decided that the Constitution did not require 12 jurors. Additionally, a Florida statute says &quot;twelve persons shall constitute a jury to try all capital cases, and six persons shall constitute a jury to try all other criminal cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aftermath</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* July 14, 2013: Protests planned in Boston, Detroit, Baltimore, San Francisco and other cities. At least one protest in California hours after the verdict late Saturday ended with vandalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama called the death of Martin a tragedy for the country and urged calm reflection, a message shared by religious and civil rights leaders hoping to ensure peaceful demonstrations in the wake of a case that became an emotional flash point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two rallies in Pittsburgh merged at the Hill Distict's Freedom Corner to speak out against the verdict, culminating with a sit-in that blocked Centre Avenue.</SPAN></P>
