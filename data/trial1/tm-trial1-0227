<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Editorial: &quot;Zimmerman Verdict Will Trigger a Racial Debate&quot;] </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a matter of grave concern that Florida's 'Stand your ground' law seems to apply to some people, but not to others. A jury yesterday dismissed all charges against George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer, who fatally shot the unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same week, Marissa Alexander, who had fired warning shots at her abusive husband, was sentenced to 20 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both defendants used the same defence, the Florida 'Stand your Ground' law, which is based on the principle that a person may justifiably use force in self-defence when there is reasonable belief of an unlawful threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real danger in the two cases is that they will ignite a furious racial debate across the whole of America since Zimmerman's successful defence may be overshadowed by his white colour and the losing defence of Alexander by her black colour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implication of the two cases is that the law works for some (white security guards), but not for others (black abused women), and this is deeply dangerous. </SPAN></P>
