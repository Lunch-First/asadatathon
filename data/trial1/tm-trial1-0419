<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROTESTS over the acquittal of a so-called vigilante who killed a black youth in Florida passed off mostly peacefully after President Barack Obama appealed for calm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five people were arrested in Los Angeles after police fired nonlethal projectiles at protesters who blocked a motorway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others were arrested after a demonstration outside a CNN building in Hollywood where demonstrators chanted &quot;No Justice, No Peace&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowds were protesting after neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman was cleared of killing Trayvon Martin, 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, was found not guilty of second degree murder by a jury in Sanford, Florida, where the killing took place in February 2012. Martin was unarmed but Zimmerman had claimed selfdefence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case divided America with the black community angry at what they see as a failure of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With tensions rising, President Obama appealed for calm. He called Martin's death a tragedy, &quot;Not just for his family, or any one community, but for America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has gone into hiding after receiving death threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he was cleared of murder he could still face court action. The Department of Justice is considering bringing race hate charges. His lawyer said he would have to leave Florida and is unlikely to find any work. &quot;He is a pariah. Who would want to hire him?&quot; said lawyer Martin O Mara. &quot;I don't know if he can ever walk the street again. There are people out for revenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
