<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My heart and prayers go out to the Martin family -- what a tragedy. I do not agree with the jury's decision to acquit George Zimmerman. He should have to pay; he took a life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also do not agree with the protests from the black community. When O.J. Simpson was acquitted of murder, black people were jubilant despite the fact that two families had lost children. The Los Angeles riots after the Rodney King incident, where a white truck driver was beaten senseless, were hardly noticed by the black community. I thought racism was on the decline. White people prove it's not by remaining silent when racism surfaces, and black people prove it's not by rioting and beating innocent white people. I had hoped this would change. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Focus on healing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury has spoken: not guilty. Respect its decision. Continue to pray for the Martin family as they heal; continue to pray for the Zimmerman family as they try to get on with their lives safely. Perhaps we should focus on the senseless killings on the inner-city streets every day -- youth killing youth. Adult members of our society need to step up and lead these young people. Teach them respect and self-confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the Martin/Zimmerman case: Let go and let God.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resist all forms of bigotry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am deeply offended by the cries of Jesse Jackson and the NAACP for civil action against George Zimmerman because a basic right of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin (i.e. life) has been denied. Where were these people when the basic rights of the two human beings O.J. Simpson was accused of killing were denied? If the outrage over Martin is due to perceptions of injustice, why now and not then?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passions rise on both sides of the argument when the subject touches even lightly on race. As is unfortunately necessary when discussing this subject, in particular when the argument does not follow &quot;politically correct&quot; opinion, the speaker (or writer, in this case) must defend himself against suspicions of bigotry. In that regard, I offer the following: My father was a strong supporter of civil rights, even in the 1940s when it more reflected conscience than conformity to a trendy movement. I was thus immersed in the concept of civil rights from birth, at times too willing to forgive errant behavior once I learned of the perpetrator's dark skin. My final maturity came after the O.J. Simpson trial. There the verdict more reflected resentment of police errors (and bigotry) than revulsion at the brutal slaughter of two human beings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our fear of attaching nasty brands to ourselves makes us ineffective in tackling the problem. Racism of any kind is wrong. When someone makes a decision, good or bad, based on the color of one's skin rather than the content of one's character, they are racist. This applies to all races, including those suffering more than their share of injustice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was taught to hate racism, but that to me meant hating it wherever I found it, and regardless of the race, religion, color or sexual preference of the person practicing it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blame the prosecutors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those calling for the heads of the jury in the Zimmerman/Martin trial should put the blame where it belongs -- on the backs of the bad performance by the state of Florida. The prosecution put on the worst trial possible, leaving the jury with mounds of conflicting and inconsequential information. National Public Radio interviewed a University of Florida law professor who gave the prosecution very low grades in performance, and concluded the state became the defense and the defense became the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race relations in this country need dialogue, but using the jury as a hatchet is not the way to obtain this objective. Dialogue and mutual understanding are the only way we will come together as a united nation, and church and civic leaders should be working toward this goal; not uttering self-serving and inflammatory statements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deaths go unnoticed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the U.S. Department of Justice may pursue George Zimmerman for a hate crime. If that doesn't work, they can always try to take it to the International Criminal Court in The Hague and have him prosecuted for crimes against humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, 18 black male 17-year-olds have been shot and killed in Chicago since February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jury acted properly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only person in this whole mess who seems to be right from the very beginning is the former Sanford police chief. Still, they fired him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the trial is finally over I feel huge comfort knowing the women of the jury stayed strong and were able to wade through the piles of, uh, mud, the prosecution slung about all over the place. These women listened, understood and followed the letter of the law. They held evidence high, and applied the law without stirring in measures of &quot;what ifs&quot; and over-the top suggestions. No easy job. There are not enough words available to praise them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman made the mistake of using poor judgment by leaving his vehicle. That error cost him dearly. Yes, he's alive to tell about it. But does he have or will he ever have a life? Probably not for a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the uproar continues. Hundreds display despicable behavior because they feel justice was not served. In my heart I believe they don't give a damn about justice. They don't bother to camouflage their need for revenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, we all feel sadness for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and his family. It's a shame. Truly a shame. But it's over and done with. If society's relationships are to be improved then educate, educate, educate. Nothing will ever get better unless people learn. Those spouting off, like the Rev. Al Sharpton, only fuel a vicious fire. That rampage of dimly disguised hate only makes matters worse.</SPAN></P>
