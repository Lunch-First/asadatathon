George Zimmerman could face federal civil rights charges under the 2009 Matthew Shepard Act, which makes bodily injury a federal crime if "committed because of the actual or perceived race, colour, religion, national origin of any person." 
"On the surface, this clearly phrased law would seem to make conviction relatively straightforward. All the prosecution would have to do is show that Zimmerman's attack on [Trayvon] Martin was racially motivated," writes Noah Feldman, a Harvard law professor. "yet how, exactly, would the federal government prove Zimmerman's motivation? Testimony from a former coworker who claims that Zimmerman made racist, anti-Arab comments on the job would likely not be admissible. Zimmerman's possible racial slur on the tape of his conversation with the 911 operator while following Martin (arguably, "coon") might conceivably be admitted as probative. But a single phrase that is difficult to interpret on the tape is unlikely to be enough to convince a jury that Martin's race was the cause for the attack.... And one jury already apparently bought some version of the self-defence story."
Writing for Bloomberg News, Mr. Feldman said trouble could arise if Mr. Zimmerman were acquitted again. "Instead of the bottom-line message being that the government wants to protect all its citizens from hate crimes, events might underscore that in 2013, a white-appearing American can still shoot an unarmed African-American teenager and get away with it not once but twice. One acquittal could perhaps be explained away by the vagaries of the jury system or the particularities of the culture of self-defence as symbolized by Florida's standyour-ground law. A second acquittal would mean something different. Because the charge would be that Zimmerman acted with racial animus, the verdict might be perceived as saying that the public didn't believe race was in issue here at all - or worse, that the public didn't care."
