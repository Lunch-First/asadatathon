<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US PRESIDENT Barack Obama has appealed to Americans for restraint amid anger from civil rights activists and public protests against the acquittal of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury comprising six women - reportedly five white and a Hispanic - late on Saturday found neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon Martin, after a long and racially charged trial that transfixed much of the US for weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second-degree murder, having pursued Martin, 17, through a gated community in the town of Sanford, eventually shooting him during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial aroused strong passions and divided those who believed that Zimmerman - whose father is white and mother is Peruvian - had racially-profiled Martin, and those who believed he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spontaneous protests broke out in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta overnight, following the verdict, though they were mostly peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, a large demonstration in New York attracted several thousand people, with placards that read, &quot;Jail racist killers, not black youth'', and &quot;We are all Trayvon. The whole damn system is guilty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the marchers in lower Manhattan wore a T-shirt proclaiming: &quot;I'm black. Please don't shoot?''</SPAN></P>
