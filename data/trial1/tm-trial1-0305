<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin was tragic and unnecessary, and ought to spark public debate about how to prevent similar incidents, US Attorney General Eric Holder said yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first comments since a state jury acquitted George Zimmerman on Saturday in the February 2012 shooting case, Holder said federal prosecutors were continuing to investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues this case has raised,&quot; Mr Holder told a convention of Delta Sigma Theta, a black sorority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mr Zimmerman was cleared of murder charges under Florida law, US prosecutors could decide to bring criminal charges under a federal hate-crimes law, and some civil rights advocates are lobbying prosecutors to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hate-crimes law would require the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt Mr Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, shot Mr Martin, who was black, because of race. Prosecutors would decide what to do based on the facts of the case and the law, Mr Holder said. The chief US prosecutor  said the Justice Department shared concerns about the case, and said he wanted to counter the &quot;mistaken beliefs and stereotypes that serve as the basis for these too common incidents.&quot; </SPAN></P>
