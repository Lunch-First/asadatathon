<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A crowd of about 100 people gathered downtown Tuesday for a vigil in reaction to the Florida acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, chanting &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; and carrying signs that read &quot;Another world is possible.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We felt very compelled to take a stand in Orange County,&quot; said Joese Hernandez, 27, an organizer with El Centro Cultural de Mexico in Santa Ana. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowds gathered at Sasscer Park around an altar with Martin's photo next to bags of Skittles and candles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 8:30 p.m., protesters peacefully walked down Ross, Main and Fourth streets with candles and fists up in the air. The rally ended after 9 p.m. at the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters carried signs reading &quot;We are human, not criminal&quot; while chanting &quot;The people say guilty.&quot; A handful of Santa Ana Police Department cars trailed the crowds and monitored traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hernandez said organizers did not expect unruliness like the Monday night demonstration in Los Angeles. At a news conference Monday night, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said violence and vandalism on city streets had resulted in 13 arrests during a protest over Zimmerman's acquittal. L.A. Police Chief Charlie Beck said about 150 people broke off from a larger, peaceful protest and began committing multiple acts of vandalism and assaults. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Santa Ana, &quot;We didn't want to stand aside while the country was marching in solidarity with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Hernandez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this case is a reminder of the fact that our livelihood is in danger simply because of the color of our skin,&quot; said Genesis Hernandez, 19, who was home for summer break from Vassar College in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another protest for Martin is scheduled in Santa Ana from 6 to 8 p.m. Thursday at 1104 S. Bristol St.</SPAN></P>
