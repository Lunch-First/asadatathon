<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE man accused of murdering 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter by an all-female jury in LA on Saturday night.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer, fatally shot and killed unarmed Martin, sparking a debate on racial profiling and civil rights. Zimmerman said he shot Martin on February 26 last year in self-defence, after the teenager knocked him to the ground, punched him and slammed his head repeatedly against the sidewalk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In finding him not guilty of murder or manslaughter, the jury agreed that Zimmerman could have been justified in shooting Martin, because he feared great bodily harm or death.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents were not in the courtroom. Their attorney, Benjamin Crump, said the family was heartbroken and that they thanked people around the world for their support. An outpouring of sympathy and shock was expressed on Twitter all over the world.  </SPAN></P>
