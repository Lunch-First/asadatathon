USA: A police officer stands guard as demonstrators march during a protest in Los Angeles after George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. The White House says President Barack Obama won't involve himself in decisions by the Justice Department on whether to pursue civil rights charges against Zimmerman after the neighbourhood watch volunteer's acquittal in the shooting of the unarmed 17-year-old last year.
