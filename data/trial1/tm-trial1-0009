<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVEN with a black president, anger over alleged racial injustice in US courts remains deeply ingrained. So uproar over the acquittal of the man who shot and killed the African-American Trayvon Martin is inevitable. But those protesting on the streets ill-serve their own case by seeing his tragic death as just the result of racial profiling rather than a consequence of America's failure to enforce effective gun control. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was fraught with racial politics from the start but heard no evidence that George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer who called police about the hooded teenager's movements, was racially motivated. He was, however, one of America's legions of licensed gun carriers. So an encounter that might otherwise have led to little more than angry words ended inevitably when Mr Zimmerman (perhaps fortified by Florida's ``Stand Your Ground'' law that justifies lethal force if attacked) shot Trayvon. The case, described by The New York Times as ``weak on evidence and long on outrage'', has been grossly politicised. When prosecutors found the evidence insufficient, Florida's Governor replaced them with others -- anything to get a conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now federal authorities may bring civil rights charges. The lesson of this tragedy is in the failure of gun-control laws and the proliferation of weapons.</SPAN></P>
