<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department says it is looking into the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges against former neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Over the weekend, a Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and other charges. Civil rights organizations have been holding rallies and vigils across the country protesting the verdict.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you believe the Justice Department should file criminal civil rights charges against Zimmerman for the shooting death of Martin? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes: 230 (8 percent) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No: 2,604 (92 percent) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KQV runs two polls simultaneously, one from Internet users, the other from telephone callers. The nonscientific polls often do not reflect the same results. KQV updates its results from time to time, so the results on its website may vary from these results. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday's question </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wall Street Journal reports employers have added more part-time employees in 2013, averaging 93,000 a month, seasonally adjusted, than full-time workers, which have averaged 22,000. Many restaurants and other businesses are trying to avoid the Affordable Care Act provision requiring employers with 50 or more full-time employees to supply affordable health insurance or pay a fine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you think the Affordable Care Act will negatively impact full-time job opportunities in the future? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes: Call 412-333-9190 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No: Call 412-333-9192 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final results can be heard on KQV-AM (1410) at 6:58 p.m. </SPAN></P>
