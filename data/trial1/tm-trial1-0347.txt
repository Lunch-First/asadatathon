The burden of proof in this case was on the prosecution to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that George Zimmerman intended to kill Trayvon Martin - it failed to do so and Mr. Zimmerman was acquitted on all charges by a jury comprising one black and five white women. The law, as defined in Florida, won out in this adjudication, not racism, a biased jury, bad prosecutors, poor police work, a deficient justice system, etc. Those disappointed or outraged by the verdict need the law to be addressed, and not find culpability in any of the aforementioned reasons for the judgment.
