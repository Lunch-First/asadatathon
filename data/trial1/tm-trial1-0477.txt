Americans protested across US following not guilty verdict for a man accused of killing an unarmed black teenager.WASHINGTON
Protests were held across the United States following jurors found George Zimmerman not guilty in the killing of TrayvonMartin.
The Florida jury cleared the volunteer neighborhood watchman, 29, of charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter, saying that he acted in self-defense when he shot 17-year-old TrayvonMartin to death on February 26, 2012.
Americans furious at the acquittal Zimmerman protested in US cities throughout Saturday night chanting "Justice for TrayvonMartin" and "If no justice no peace."
Around one thousand US citizens gathered at Malcolm X Meridian Hill Park in Washington D.C. and marched along "U Street," which until the 1920s, was home to the nation's largest urban African American community and was known as "Black Broadway".
Protesters arrived at Howard University and held a memorial in remembrance of Martin.
While Afro-Americans dominated the crowd, white people also gave support.
Protests continued in four different spots across New York including the Union Square where protesters carried black colored balloons and banners that read "No to racism" and "We are all Martin".
