July 16--Pocono residents upset with George Zimmerman's acquittal are planning a peaceful vigil for TrayvonMartin on Saturday in East Stroudsburg. 
"What we really want to do is have the community come together. I know people have different opinions, but we want people who have different opinions to come together," said Cassie Tucker, who is organizing the vigil with her friend Akila Hayden.
"We just thought that justice wasn't served and instead of doing it violently by protesting, we wanted to do something that would bring peace to the whole community," Hayden said.
The vigil will be held at 7 p.m. Saturday in front of the Bargain Book Warehouse across from Wal-Mart in East Stroudsburg and will include a balloon release.
The event is being called Justus (Justice) for TrayvonMartin Balloon Release.
The name of the event is a play on words, "like 'just us' coming together," Tucker said.
Hayden's sister, the Rev. Romanay Maureen Lashley of The Upper Room Anointed Word Ministry in Tobyhanna, will also say a few words at the event.
"I think my focal point will be to promote as much peace and prayer as possible," Lashley said.
"I think it's important for Trayvon's family, which is why I said peace and prayer -- keeping his family in our prayers."
For more information, contact Hayden at 570-369-7177 or Tucker at 570-369-8188.
