POP legend Stevie Wonder has announced he will not perform again in Florida until the state's notorious Stand Your Ground law is repealed. 
His decision follows outrage by other celebrities and performers at the acquittal of neighbourhood vigilante George Zimmerman.
Zimmerman, 29, was cleared of the second degree murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin after a trial that divided America.
Singing superstar Stevie, 63, made his statement at a show in Quebec City, Canada, over the weekend.
He said: "I decided today that until the Stand Your Ground law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again."
Stars such as Jay-Z, 43, Beyonc, 31, A Tribe Called Quest and Q-Tip, 43, were among those who have dedicated performances to the late teenager.
Under the Florida law a person is able to use deadly force if they fear their life is under threat.
Fury at the Zimmerman verdict led to an outpouring of emotion on the streets of many US cities but Florida officials have insisted that they will not consider scrapping the law.
