<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;&quot;Re: &quot;'Jury has spoken': Obama&quot; (Gazette, July 15) As a Canadian born in the United States, I was both outraged and disappointed after George Zimmerman was acquitted of the manslaughter and seconddegree murder of Trayvon Martin - an unarmed, black, 17-year-old boy - whom he indisputably killed in February 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a case that reeks of racial profiling, Zimmerman, 29, chose to ignore orders by police not to confront Martin, as the teenager was walking to his father's house in a gated community in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why was Zimmerman following Martin? Because he considered a black teenager holding a bag of Skittles and an iced tea &quot;suspicious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States had come so far in recent years toward eliminating racism and the unfair treatment of African Americans in their society that this represents a monumental, sad, admission that racism is still alive and well in a country that not 50 years ago, was still making blacks sit at the back of the bus.</SPAN></P>
