  HBO's "Newsroom," a scripted drama set in a New York cable station, drew 2.2. million viewers in its season debut Sunday - up slightly from its debut last summer.  
  "Newsroom" was created by Aaron Sorkin and stars Jeff Daniels as sarcastic news anchor Jack McAvoy. 
  Its season premiere was particularly timely, given Saturday's acquittal of George Zimmerman in the Trayvon Martin case, which ran wall-to-wall on all the cable news channels throughout the weekend.
