DOZENS of protesters were arrested yesterday as Americans again voiced their anger at George Zimmerman's acquittal for the murder of Trayvon Martin.
About 80 were detained after a rally in Los Angeles during which police fired back bean-bag rounds after a section of the crowd began hurling projectiles at them.
Violence was also reported at a protest in Oakland, California, with crowds smashing windows and painting graffiti. The 'Justice for Trayvon' campaign is gathering pace across the nation, with musicians also venting their spleen at Mr Zimmerman's release for the killing of the unarmed 17-year-old in Sanford, Florida.
Beyonc held a minute's silence for the Florida teenager at her show in Tennessee, while her husband, rap star Jay-Z, paid tribute as he closed the Wireless festival in Stratford, east London.
Earlier on the Olympic Park bill, Q-Tip of hip hop stalwarts A Tribe Called Quest declared: 'Yesterday in America, we saw a miscarriage of justice. It's not the first time this has happened. Pray for us - we need help.'
Mr Zimmerman could still face civil rights charges as the Justice Department looks into a possible case against him.
