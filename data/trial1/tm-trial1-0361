<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A juror in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin murder case said last night she thought that George Zimmerman's &quot;heart was in the right place&quot; on the night he fatally shot the unarmed teenager in Sanford, Fla.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The woman, known only as Juror B37, spoke publicly for the first time during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think George Zimmerman's heart was in the right place,&quot; said the woman, appearing in silhouette. &quot;But he went above and beyond what he should've done . . . It just went terribly wrong.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She also said she believed Martin &quot;threw the first punch&quot; in the encounter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think Trayvon got mad and attacked him,&quot; she said. &quot;I had no doubt that George feared for his life.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Late Saturday night, the six-woman jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder. Three panelists originally wanted to convict but changed their minds, the juror said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   She did not believe race was an aspect of the case, and emphasized Zimmerman had a right to defend himself and should be allowed to carry a gun again.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He's learned his lesson,&quot; she said. &quot;I think he would be more responsible [with a gun] than anyone else on the planet right now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The juror initially planned to write a book but nixed the plan early this morning. &quot;I have realized the best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book,&quot; she said in a statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The woman criticized a key witness for the prosecution, Rachel Jeantel, 19, who was asked at the trial to read a letter she supposedly wrote about the slaying, only to admit she couldn't read cursive.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think she felt inadequate because of her education and communication skills,&quot; the juror said. &quot;I didn't think [the testimony] was very credible.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later on CNN, Jeantel responded that she was &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;upset&quot; by the juror's characterization.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jeantel also disagreed with the juror about the racial component of the incident, saying &quot;Let's be honest&quot; - it was &quot;racial.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She told Piers Morgan that Martin did not have guns but smoked weed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Trayvon was not a thug,&quot; Jeantel said. &quot;Weed didn't make him go crazy. It just made him go hungry.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the meantime, Zimmerman's parents said last night they have received &quot;an enormous amount of death threats,&quot; and have remained in hiding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Speaking with ABC's Barbara Walters, Robert and Gladys Zimmerman said they are afraid even to reach out to their son. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Under the circumstances, we have not been able to talk to him,&quot; Gladys Zimmerman said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;To tell you the truth, we don't trust anything, not even the phones.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
