Based on the broadcast " "reports of testimony and the contradiction in identifying the voice heard in the 911 call, I was expecting the six jurors would acquit George Zimmerman of the murder of Trayvon Martin, although the youth was unarmed. 
Reasonable doubt prevailed in this court of justice, but does not seem to prevail all over America! In the coming days, the verdict may cause turmoil, even riots. I believe this whole story could more positively give way to a global questioning on the two main issues: racial profiling and the risk factors involved in using a gun in self-defence.
In the United States today, a paradox stems from recent events: Certain states, such as Texas, want to reform the abortion law to protect the basic right to life, yet, many states still want to defend the constitutional right to own and bear arms.
Guns are not always owned by people who can thoroughly assess the danger risk.
