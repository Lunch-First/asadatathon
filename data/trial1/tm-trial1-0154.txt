Related story: Protesters rally at Victorville mall
Dozens of people marched through the streets of San Bernardino and Victorville on Wednesday demanding justice for Trayvon Martin, a teen killed in Sanford, Fla., last year by a neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman. 
On Saturday, Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges in a Florida courtroom by a jury of six.
Organizers of the San Bernardino march, Starh Hendrix, 26 of San Jacinto and Sharia Brown, 25, of San Bernardino, expected to have at least 100 people join them in a peaceful march for civil rights.
"We need to sound off and tell the world we deserve justice, peace and equality in the justice system in the United States," Hendrix said. "This is a peaceful march through the city."
Since the acquittal groups all over the nation have led protests chanting, "No justice, no peace."
Some of the protests in California have led to rioting and random violence, but Hendrix and Brown demand that the San Bernardino march be done with peace.
"If it turns violent then what does that prove for our cause?" Brown said. "It would just take us back to the beginning and we'll have to start all over trying to get the same rights as everyone else."
