Washington: Protests,vigils,and sporadic acts of violence erupted across America as black groups and civil libertarians demonstrated in scores of cities against the acquittal of a self-appointed white neighbourhood watchdog on charges of killing a black youth,while a concerned President Barack Obama appealed for calm and respect for the legal process that resulted in the jury's not-guilty verdict.America's first mixed race President has so far been cautious in speaking about a case that has convulsed America for the racial divide it has brought to the fore,except for one time when he said that if he had a son,he would be like TrayvonMartin,the 17-year old Florida kid who was shot and killed by George Zimmerman on suspicion of "being up to no good." While that suggested Obama was weighing in on the side of the slain victim,on Sunday the President was more circumspect in the face of black fury."The death of TrayvonMartin was a tragedy.Not just for his family,or for any one community,but for America.I know this case has elicited strong passions.And in the wake of the verdict,I know those passions may be running even higher.But we are a nation of laws,and a jury has spoken.I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son," Obama said in a statement.Crowds gathered in many public squares from New York City to Washington DC to Los Angeles,where there was faceto-face confrontation with riot police,including firing of rubber bullets at demonstrators.Many demonstrators wore "hoodies" - hooded sweatshirts mostly worn by young blacks - to express solidarity with Martin.Obama also called for selfexamination from Americans in a country wracked by endemic gun violence that claims nearly 30,000 lives every years.But immediate focus of anger and attention in public demonstration was not so much the trigger-happiness of America but the racial divide that many activists say resulted in the Zimmerman's version of firing in self-defence after a violent confrontation with Martin being readily accepted.For the full story log on to
