KILLING ANGER
RIHANNA has spoken out after George Zimmerman was cleared of murdering unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.
She took to Instagram after he walked free over the shooting, ranting that the US criminal justice system was ``ph...ed.'' ``A child was gunned down for no reason!'' she wrote. ``And nothing about that sounds like murder?''
