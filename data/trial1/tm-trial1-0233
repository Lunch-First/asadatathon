<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PITTSFIELD -- As a mother with a 17-year-old teenage son, Lisa Clayton of Pittsfield has been worried for the safety of her teen and other young people since the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, who was unarmed, was gunned down by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman, then 28, last February in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. Martin was returning there after a trip to a nearby convenience store when Zimmerman deemed the teen's activity suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was acquitted of murder charges by a jury on Saturday, a decision that has since caused a rift across the nation and generated a wave of protests, rallies and vigils, some peaceful, some belligerent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 100 residents rallied for the slain teen on Park Square last March, many crying injustice prior to Zimmerman's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clayton said she and her family and friends only want peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been watching [this case] very closely. We have a 17-year-old. The fact that [Martin] was another 17-year-old just walking home from a 7-11 minding his own business and was shot is just wrong,&quot; said Clayton. &quot;A lot of kids these days are singled out as being a punk or in a gang for how they dress, when the fact is a lot of kids aren't looking for trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was upset by Saturday's verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People need to stand up for safety in cities, for parents, for this young boy who got his life taken from him so young,&quot; said Clayton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vigil for Martin, said the Pittsfield mother, is meant to be brief, quiet and peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want any negativity, no yelling or angry signs,&quot; she said. &quot;The outcome, I hope, will be to stop all this negativity and violence, especially that which is aimed toward young adults.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People may begin gathering at 7 p.m. on Park Square in downtown Pittsfield. At 7:17, the approximate time of Martin's shooting, people are asked to light a candle and hold a moment of silence. Clayton said people should bring their own candle, and may wear a gray hooded sweatshirt. That kind of sweatshirt, worn by Martin at the time of his death, has become a symbol of protest and solidarity among Martin sympathizers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the end of this silent protest, people can just disperse on their own. We just want to show the [Martin] family that their son's light will shine on,&quot; Clayton said.</SPAN></P>
