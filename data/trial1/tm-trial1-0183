<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramadan could be deadliest yet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD - Ramadan this year is shaping up to be the deadliest in Iraq since a bloody insurgency and rampant sectarian killings pushed the country to the edge of civil war in the wake of the U.S.-led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein. Suicide attacks, car bombings and other violence have killed at least 169 Iraqis just seven days into the Islamic holy month. The death toll in the first week of Ramadan hasn't been that high since 2007, intensifying fears that Iraq is slipping back into widespread chaos. There seems to be little pattern in the range of targets, adding to the sense of unease in what is meant to be a month of spiritual growth and generosity. Several of those killed over the past week died at a busy northern teashop while playing mehebis, a game where players hope to win sweets by guessing who among their opposing team is hiding a ring in their hands.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spacewalker survives scare</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - In one of the most harrowing spacewalks in years, an astronaut had to rush back into the International Space Station on Tuesday after a mysterious water leak inside his helmet robbed him of the ability to speak or hear and could have caused him to choke. Italian Luca Parmitano seemed fine after the dangerous episode, which might have been caused by a leaky drinking bag. His spacewalking partner, American Christopher Cassidy, had to help him inside after NASA quickly aborted the spacewalk. No one - neither the astronauts in orbit nor flight controllers in Houston - breathed easily until Parmitano was back inside and his helmet was yanked off. &quot;He looks miserable. But OK,&quot; Cassidy, assured everyone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman protests turn violent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES - Disturbances spiralling out of Los Angeles street protests against the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin will not be allowed to continue, city leaders vowed Tuesday after a spate of vandalism and assaults that led to 14 arrests. Demonstrations began occurring in California Saturday evening, when word of the Florida verdict arrived. Trouble has repeatedly occurred in Oakland and in Los Angeles, particularly in the Crenshaw district southwest of downtown. On Monday night, about 150 people split off from a demonstration at a Crenshaw-area park and ran through streets, jumping on cars, trying to break store windows and committing assaults. A Wal-Mart store was vandalized by intruders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boat capsizes, killing four asylum seekers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CANBERRA, Australia - A boat carrying 150 people believed to be asylum seekers capsized in the Indian Ocean on Tuesday, killing four people, Australian officials said. The boat turned over in rough seas north of Christmas Island, an Australian territory 500 kilometres (310 miles) south of Jakarta, Indonesia, Australia's Customs and Border Protection said in a statement. Two navy ships had earlier been sent to assist the vessel but were unable to board it due to bad weather. The ships were escorting it to Christmas Island, where Australia operates a detention camp for asylum seekers, when it flipped. Rescuers dropped life rafts into the water and plucked 144 survivors to safety. Four bodies were recovered and the search was called off Tuesday night, the border protection authority said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUCKNOW, India - More than 5,700 people, missing since last month's devastating floods that ravaged northern India, are now presumed dead, a top official said Tuesday. Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna said Tuesday that the Uttarakhand state government would give financial compensation to the families of people who may have perished in the floods and landslides that hit the Himalayan region in June. The government had earlier put the death toll at 600 but repeatedly stressed that it would be significantly higher. Bahuguna said recovery operations would continue, adding the exact number of people who died may never be known.</SPAN></P>
