<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As about 70 people walked from Annapolis' City Dock to Lawyers Mall Tuesday evening, they chanted &quot;save our children&quot; and &quot;justice for Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a less than 24 hours, Cynthia Carter, a former Annapolis alderwoman, had organized a march in memory of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the African-American Florida teenager who was shot to death by George Zimmerman in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who said he was acting in self-defense, was acquitted of all charges by a jury on Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the verdict, Martin has been viewed by some as a victim of racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants in the march held signs with slogans including &quot;Don't kill our kids&quot; and &quot;Do not buy Florida products.&quot; Mayor Josh Cohen and the three African-American City Council members - Alderman Ken Kirby, D-Ward 6; Alderwoman Classie Hoyle, D-Ward 3; and Alderwoman Sheila Finlayson, D-Ward 4 - were among those speaking at the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoyle said it saddens her to see that some things in race relations haven't changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She talked about her memories of the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American boy who was killed in Mississippi after supposedly flirting with a white woman in a store. He had gone there to buy candy. She remembers putting her head on her desk at school and crying when she heard the news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before Zimmerman shot Martin, the teen had gone to a store to buy Skittles and an iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here we are now, it's 2013, and we can't send our kids to the store for candy,&quot; Hoyle said. &quot;Will black people ever be first-class citizens?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arnold Smith, who owns a business called the Goodie Bus, said he was almost glad Zimmerman &quot;got off&quot; because the outrage and frustration seem to have mobilized the African-American community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Each one of you here is charged with changing yourselves,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers are planning another march for Saturday to join a national series of rallies in memory of Martin. No time or place has been set yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carl Snowden, an Annapolis civil rights activist, said a group of African-American leaders will ask House Speaker Michael E. Busch, D-Annapolis, to introduce state legislation next year to make it a crime for law enforcement in Maryland to profile individuals based on race. Snowden was not among those marching in the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, called the Caucus of African-American Leaders, is a local coalition of clergy, the Black Chamber of Commerce and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Anne Arundel County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowden said the caucus will make the request at a previously scheduled meeting with the delegate on Aug. 7. Its members would like to see a bill named the &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Anti-Racial Profiling Act,&quot; modeled after federal legislation U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., has sponsored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are some very strong feelings in the community that there was a miscarriage of justice,&quot; Snowden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many believe Martin's case could have happened in Maryland. Snowden talked about the case of Noah Jamahl Jones, an African-American teenager from Pasadena who died in a 2004 brawl involving white teens. No hate-crimes charges were ever filed, and the only defendant who went to trial, Jacob T. Fortney, was found not guilty of all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People believe there were racial overtones in the acquittal,&quot; Snowden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Busch could not be reached Tuesday for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sign up to vote</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Annapolis Democratic Action Committee, a self-described group of progressive Democrats, also is using the Zimmerman verdict to encourage people to vote. Kirby said he would be at the pool at The Harbour House public-housing neighborhood in Eastport to help sign people up to vote this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter registration forms will be available during the pool's operating hours from noon to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee sent out an email to members Monday, urging them to channel their anger toward positive change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict shows why you must never lose your voice to fight injustice and unfairness,&quot; the committee wrote. &quot;Yet there is no doubt that this year's city elections will be the most important in years and we will need your voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday evening's march was not the first rally on the Martin case to convene on Lawyers Mall off College Avenue. In March 2012, several state lawmakers wore hooded sweatshirts and held a press conference to draw awareness to the teenager's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finlayson urged people to sign the NAACP petition asking the Department of Justice to continue its investigation into the case and pursue civil rights charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saturday was a very bad day for the world,&quot; Finlayson said. &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death must not be in vain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
