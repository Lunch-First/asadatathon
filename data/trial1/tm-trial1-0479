<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 15--Wearing gray-hooded sweatshirts, two Yuba City teens on Sunday showed their support for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by holding signs outside the Sutter County Courthouse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, jurors in Florida acquitted George Zimmerman of all charges in the February 2012 shooting death of Martin, an unarmed black teenager whose death provoked a national debate over racial profiling and self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Jacquerie, 17, said he and his friend felt compelled to make a statement, as they are the same age as the slain teenager. His sign had messages on both sides: &quot;R.I.P. Trayvon&quot; and &quot;Trayvon was the victim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was online, and I was just brought back to the fact that we don't live in a free society,&quot; Jacquerie said of when he heard about the verdict. &quot;Violence against youth is common in the way of the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Devon Powell, 17, who attends Feather River Academy in Yuba City, said most drivers passing by were supportive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mostly honking, we got a couple of middle fingers,&quot; he said, adding he was shocked about the verdict when he read it online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell said he posted a status on Facebook about the demonstration to help garner support.</SPAN></P>
