<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An FBI report on the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin killing could drown out the growing chorus calling for a civil-rights prosecution of acquitted shooter George Zimmerman, legal experts said yesterday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the report, FBI agents quoted the lead investigator describing the neighborhood-watch volunteer as &quot;overzealous and as having a 'little hero complex,' but not as a racist.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The April 2012 report says Sanford, Fla., Detective Chris Serino found &quot;Zimmerman's actions were not based on Martin's skin color&quot; but &quot;on his attire, the total circumstances of the encounter and the previous burglary suspects in the community.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Prominent Manhattan lawyer Gerald Shargel said the report &quot;clearly weighs in Zimmerman's favor&quot; and is &quot;going to carry a lot of weight in a charging decision.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;They need proof beyond a reasonable doubt that this was racially motivated,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Top civil-rights lawyer Ron Kuby said: &quot;Even if the FBI's assessment of George Zimmerman was that he was a flaming racist, I don't think there would be a federal prosecution.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The [Justice] Department knows they're unlikely to prevail, and federal prosecutors don't like to lose,&quot; Kuby said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Attorney General Eric Holder yesterday said he was &quot;mindful of the pain felt by our nation surrounding the tragic, unnecessary shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he was noncommittal regarding the federal probe of the slaying, telling the national convention of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority in DC that the Justice Department would follow &quot;the facts and the law.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Outside the Manhattan federal courthouse, local members of Congress called for civil-rights charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin did not have a gun. He did not have a knife . . . All Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had was a pack of Skittles,&quot; said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-Brooklyn). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-Queens) said: &quot;We know the jury has made a decision, but we do not have to agree with that decision, and we will not.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, one of the trial's six jurors has inked a deal to sell her story. &quot;Juror B37&quot; plans to write a book with her lawyer husband, said literary agent Sharlene Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also yesterday, the NYPD said 15 people were busted across upper Manhattan for blocking traffic during protests of the acquittal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Post reporter saw protesters hurling bottles at cops, but no injuries were reported.  </SPAN></P>
