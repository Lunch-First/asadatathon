<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The united States has finally come into a curious and crucial point as regards its democratic tradition. The Rule of Law is one of the touchstones of democracy. yet popular expression is as much a benchmark as anything else. So when a jury acquits George Zimmerman of murder, but the street verdict or popular belief declares him guilty, which should prevail? Federal authorities are considering civil rights violations charges. Is that because Mr. Zimmerman is white and Trayvon Martin was black? I do not recall any riots after the acquittal of O.J. Simpson. There was disappointment and a successful civil suit. In fact, it is now the stigma of the American justice system that whenever a crime is committed, the race of those involved becomes an issue. What happened to finding the truth? And if the truth goes against popular belief, as spawned by social and news media, is a riot and destruction of property justifiable? Norman M. Ostonal, New Westminster, B.C. </SPAN></P>
