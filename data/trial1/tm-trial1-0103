<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 17--The Owensboro chapter of the NAACP will hold a rally Friday evening for people wanting to express their opinions and feelings over last week's verdict in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally will be at 5:30 p.m. Friday at Fifth and Sycamore streets. The event will feature talks by local ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was unarmed when he was fatally shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, during an altercation in Sanford, Fla., in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman reported Martin as suspicious to police but continued to follow Martin, even after 911 dispatchers told him to back off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman fatally shot Martin in some type of altercation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed self-defense and told police he shot Martin because Martin had slammed him to the ground and was beating him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, a Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty of charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal of Friday's rally is not to vent anger about the verdict, NAACP President Evan Taylor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are feelings out there that are for and against the Trayvon verdict,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;Those feelings are neither right or wrong; they just are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministers who will speak at the rally &quot;will focus on the things we have in common,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;We are being responsible in a lot of ways, by providing an opportunity for appropriate venting for the passions that are there, with the hope we can direct&quot; people's emotions in a positive direction, Taylor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Being pissed without purpose is just being pissed,&quot; Taylor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sam Byrd, treasurer for the local NAACP chapter, said people with whom he has spoken have strong feelings about the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The focus (of the rally) is not on the justice system -- the verdict is in,&quot; Byrd said. &quot;What we hope to accomplish is (to show) that we have to believe in justice system, even though it doesn't seem fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have a right to not agree with (the verdict) and to express your disagreement,&quot; Byrd said. &quot;You can protest without destroying property ... A lot of people do not agree and are showing their disagreement. This is the United States of America, and a lot of people fought to have that right disagree in a nondisagreeable way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor said the idea for the rally came from several phone calls he received on Monday about the verdict. Taylor said people have continued to debate the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, one thing that was fervently discussed was that (the belief) that prosecutors lost the case on purpose,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;I've heard criticisms of the all-white jury, the judge, the limitations on the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are many white people who disagree with the verdict,&quot; Taylor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are trying to have a productive message that is positive, (rather than) focus on destruction and blame,&quot; Taylor said.</SPAN></P>
