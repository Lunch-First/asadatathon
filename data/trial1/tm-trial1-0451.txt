US President Barack Obama has appealed to Americans for restraint amid anger from civil rights activists and public protests against the acquittal of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager. 
A Florida jury comprising six women, reportedly five white and a hispanic, found neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering TrayvonMartin.
Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second-degree murder, having pursued Martin, 17, through a gated community in the town of Sanford, eventually shooting him during an altercation on February 26.
The trial divided those who believed that Zimmerman, whose father is white and mother is Peruvian, had racially-profiled Martin and those who believed he acted in self-defence.
Spontaneous protests broke out in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta overnight following the verdict, although they were mostly peaceful.
On Sunday, a large demonstration in New York attracted several thousand people, with placards that read, ``Jail racist killers, not black youth'', and ``We are all Trayvon. The whole damn system is guilty''.
However, Mr Obama, the first black US president, urged people to accept the trial verdict.
``We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,'' he said. ``I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.''
