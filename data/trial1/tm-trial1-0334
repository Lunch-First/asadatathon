<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 16--Prosecutors faced a daunting task in trying to prove George Zimmerman murdered Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Chippewa Valley attorneys said Monday, two days after jurors found Zimmerman not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having to prove that Zimmerman was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt led to the jury's not guilty verdict, said Rich White, a former Eau Claire County district attorney who now works for the Weld, Riley, Prenn &amp; Ricci law firm in Eau Claire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you asked those jurors, that if the burden of proof was lessened, they would have found him guilty,&quot; White said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday a six-person jury found Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager. The decision has sparked outrage on the part of many across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Norseng, an attorney at Wiley Law in Chippewa Falls who also is a Chippewa County court commissioner, views the jury instructions in Florida as a reason why a not guilty verdict was given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Wisconsin, jurors are asked to examine the evidence and find a person guilty if they have &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; However, Florida jurors are told they must be &quot;absolutely certain,&quot; Norseng said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think you can define 'absolutely certain' as higher than 'beyond a reasonable doubt,' &quot; Norseng said. &quot;Beyond a reasonable doubt is an extremely high burden. It's really not a 'not guilty' decision. It's a decision of 'we don't know for sure, so we can't convict.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week the prosecution was criticized for asking a police officer if he found Zimmerman's account of the assault to be believable. The officer said he thought Zimmerman was truthful in his testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite that, White said he doesn't believe he would have handled the case much differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot be necessarily critical of the prosecution's effort in this case,&quot; White said. &quot;When you have situations like this, when you have a death and the evidence is competing in how you conclude the evidence, it's very difficult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reading juries is extremely difficult, White said, noting that he's noticed a rise in hung juries as more people watch law-and-order television shows that make them feel like they have more knowledge of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've tried over 200 jury trials,&quot; White said. &quot;The one thing I know is it's exceedingly difficult to predict how a jury will interact with each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Bob Ferg said he wasn't surprised when he heard the verdict in the George Zimmerman murder trial in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you try cases long enough, you get all types of verdicts,&quot; said Ferg, attorney for the city of Chippewa Falls, a Chippewa County court commissioner and part of the Ferg &amp; Sinclair law office in Chippewa Falls. &quot;I'm not shocked, but I'm not shocked by any verdict these days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferg said the jury had a lot of material to examine from the three-week trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They spent 15 hours (deliberating), so they put in their time on it,&quot; Ferg said. &quot;It's really hard to second guess what any jury does because you really have to be there for the whole trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chippewa Falls attorney Kerry Kelm said that for the U.S. judicial system to work, people must believe the jury got the verdict right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's difficult for people to appreciate the difficult job of jurors,&quot; Kelm said. &quot;What I saw told me I wouldn't be surprised with a not guilty (verdict) because there was reasonable doubt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
