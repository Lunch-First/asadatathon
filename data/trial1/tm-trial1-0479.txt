July 15--Wearing gray-hooded sweatshirts, two Yuba City teens on Sunday showed their support for TrayvonMartin by holding signs outside the Sutter County Courthouse. 
On Saturday, jurors in Florida acquitted George Zimmerman of all charges in the February 2012 shooting death of Martin, an unarmed black teenager whose death provoked a national debate over racial profiling and self-defense.
Eric Jacquerie, 17, said he and his friend felt compelled to make a statement, as they are the same age as the slain teenager. His sign had messages on both sides: "R.I.P. Trayvon" and "Trayvon was the victim."
"I was online, and I was just brought back to the fact that we don't live in a free society," Jacquerie said of when he heard about the verdict. "Violence against youth is common in the way of the law."
Devon Powell, 17, who attends Feather River Academy in Yuba City, said most drivers passing by were supportive.
"Mostly honking, we got a couple of middle fingers," he said, adding he was shocked about the verdict when he read it online.
Powell said he posted a status on Facebook about the demonstration to help garner support.
