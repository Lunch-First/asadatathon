-Does the not-guilty decision in Florida in the George Zimmerman case mean that any time two people get into a fistfight one of the assailants can pull his gun and shoot and kill his unarmed opponent and then claim self-defense because he can show a few bruises?
-Elk are much, much bigger animals than deer. I am horrified at the idea that our state, without even informing our citizens, let these huge animals on our public lands. This is a travesty. Stop it. 
-I wonder what impact it would have if all of the Trayvon Martin demonstrators were doing so because of the young-male black-on-black murders in most big cities. Their actions are sending mixed signals, the same thing they are complaining about.
-Joe Holland is, like all Republicans, trying to remove freedoms, not expand them. That's why they can't win a national election.
-Good grief, is Wade Linger's ego so fragile that he can't even step down as BOE president without having his buddy Steve Roberts write one last paean to his tenure? What exactly did he accomplish as president other than firing the former state superintendent and installing his pal in her place? What's different for kids? Nothing.
-For many weeks, CNN, Headline News, MSNBC and Fox News have continuously bombarded us with the Zimmerman murder trial. Now that it's over, they are trying to stir up racial unrest over the verdict so they can continue to report "breaking news" and make a mockery of our justice system. Shame on these networks.
-Venters should not be worried about President Obama, who is making our country economically sound, but be mad at CEOs and Republicans who want you to be paid below livable wages and stuff their pockets with fruits of your hard labor letting your family go hungry and without health care.
-Brine from fracking put in wells polluting drinking water comes when the state is strapped for money. State leaders vote OK to allow it in the name of jobs. They should leave office and be convicted of poisoning. We pay cost of all cleanup while oil barons go free. Sissonville and Fayetteville areas will suffer.
-Would someone tell me what that C&O commercial means? They just mention C&O's name and then everyone just walks out of the restaurant. It's worse than Chris Miller's.
-Yesterday a campaign ad showed up on my Facebook page. The good news is there were 450 likes, which means positive. There were well over 1,000 negative comments. We might be singing bye-bye Joe in a couple years.
-The reason that a "Federal case against Zimmerman seen as difficult" is because, as with the bogus state charge, he's innocent.
-I don't know why this paper won't print anything about the handicapped and the elderly getting meals two or three days a week.
-I don't know where the WV Style writers get their info, but 1955 is not retro and no one dressed like the models in the newspaper Sunday. It was the era of Ozzie and Harriet, June Cleaver, etc. Do you really think women wore minidresses? You're one decade too early!
-I see where President Obama is not going to enforce his Obamacare on some employers now. Maybe he would like to forget the rest of it, including the more than $100 per month increase in insurance for the wife and I. So sick and tired of paying for others.
-Way to go, Kanawha County Board of Education. With your new rule about no out-of-district transfers, kids from overcrowded Overbrook Elementary are not allowed to transfer a couple of miles away to Kenna, which is underenrolled! Parents got their letters of refusal last week! Remember these things, voters.
-The product of the "entertainment" industry today, across all its venues, can be described as little more than unadulterated garbage. Sadly, most of the under-50 crowd must think this is normal and that it's always been this way. Of the sick, by the sick, for the sick.
-Joe Manchin won his first couple elections because people thought they were voting for A. James Manchin. By the time they realized the difference it was too late. A new generation of uninformed voters cast votes for Joe because they recognized the name, not his record.
-One driver can't enter the Interstate without traffic slowing down for them. Another can't exit because of foliage. We've become a society of nondrivers. Maybe these two drivers need to hang up their keys before they drive through the front of a building and blame it on a mechanical problem.
-The wannabe lawyers screaming about their rights being violated at DUI and seatbelt checkpoints are forgetting something important: Driving isn't a God-given constitutional right. It's a privilege. A privilege can be taken away if you don't follow the rules.
