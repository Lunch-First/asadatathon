<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of people marched through the streets of San Bernardino and Victorville on Wednesday demanding justice for Trayvon Martin, a teen killed in Sanford, Fla., last year by a neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges in a Florida courtroom by a jury of six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers of the San Bernardino march, Starh Hendrix, 26 of San Jacinto and Sharia Brown, 25, of San Bernardino, expected to have at least 100 people join them in a peaceful march for civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to sound off and tell the world we deserve justice, peace and equality in the justice system in the United States,&quot; Hendrix said. &quot;This is a peaceful march through the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the acquittal groups all over the nation have led protests chanting, &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the protests in California have led to rioting and random violence, but Hendrix and Brown demand that the San Bernardino march be done with peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it turns violent then what does that prove for our cause?&quot; Brown said. &quot;It would just take us back to the beginning and we'll have to start all over trying to get the same rights as everyone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An original version of this story incorrectly estimated the total number of participants in the rallies in San Bernardino and Victorville. We regret the error.</SPAN></P>
