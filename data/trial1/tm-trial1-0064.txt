AMERICA: Vigils and rallies will be held in 100 US cities this weekend to press for federal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman over the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin.
Prominent civil rights activist the Rev Al Sharpton said the rallies and vigils would be staged on Saturday at federal buildings.
The Justice Department is investigating whether he violated the black teenager's civil rights when he shot the 17-year-old during a confrontation in Sanford, Florida, in February last year.
The neighbourhood watch volunteer, 29, said he fired his gun in self-defence, and a six-member jury acquitted him of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges.
Violence erupted on the West Coast during protests over the acquittal.
Los Angeles police said about 150 people broke off from a larger, peaceful protest and began walking through the streets, committing multiple acts of vandalism and several assaults.
More than 300 officers were called to the scene but they held back from directly engaging with the protesters in an attempt to allow a peaceful end to the demonstration.
Thirteen people were arrested and officers warned they would adopt a much stricter stance if the protests continued for another night.
At least one person was injured and police made nine arrests when another protest turned violent in Oakland.
