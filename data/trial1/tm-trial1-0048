<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOUR JURORS in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case distanced themselves Tuesday night from a fellow panelist who showed sympathy for George Zimmerman in a TV interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just moments after CNN aired part two of its interview with the juror known as B37, four of her fellow members on the six-woman jury issued a statement saying, &quot;The opinions of Juror B37, expressed on the Anderson Cooper show, were her own, and not in any way representative of the jurors listed below.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four jurors - who signed themselves jurors B51, B76, E6 and E40 - said serving on the jury had been &quot;a highly emotional and physically draining experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The death of a teenager weighed heavily on our hearts, but in the end we did what the law required us to do,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interview aired Tuesday night, juror B37 said Trayvon &quot;played a huge role in his death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anonymous juror said she believes Zimmerman was &quot;justified in shooting&quot; the 17-year-old high school student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think race had anything to do with this trial,&quot; she told Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean just because he was black and George was Spanish or Puerto Rican, I don't think it had anything to do with this trial,&quot; she said in a reference to Zimmerman, who is half-Peruvian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury's post-trial conflict played out as U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said he is gunning for &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's top lawman said during a speech at an NAACP convention in Orlando that the law - which featured prominently during Zimmerman's trial - should be reexamined and reformed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time to question laws that so dangerously expand self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods,&quot; Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not comment on the Justice Department's ongoing investigation into whether Zimmerman's shooting of Trayvon, an unarmed black teen, was motivated by racial bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1 million people have signed online petitions calling on the Justice Department to file a civil rights lawsuit against Zimerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Juror B37 said Zimmerman is only guilty of &quot;not using his senses&quot; when he confronted Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think he profiled him as a racial thing,&quot; the juror said. &quot;I think he profiled him just as someone in the neighborhood who was suspicious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile a tell-all book by Juror B37 is off the table following an outcry that she was trying to profit from the trial and its controversial conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that I am returned to my family and to society in general, I have realized that the best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book and return instead to my life as it was before I was called to sit on this jury,&quot; the juror said in a statement Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
