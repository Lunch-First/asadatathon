STEVIE Wonder says he will not perform in Florida and other states with a "stand your ground" firearm self-defence law.
In a video posted on YouTube, the 63-year-old singer said at a concert in Quebec City, Canada, on Sunday "that until the 'stand your ground' law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again". The "stand your ground" law allows people to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger. A jury acquitted George Zimmerman, who shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges on Saturday.
