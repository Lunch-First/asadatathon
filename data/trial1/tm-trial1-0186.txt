A million Americans have heaped pressure on the nation's first black Attorney-General by demanding that the killer of TrayvonMartin be prosecuted for a hate crime. 
As Eric Holder prepared for a televised address to civil rights leaders last night, a petition calling for George Zimmerman, the acquitted Neighbourhood Watch volunteer, to face federal charges was winning support across the country.
Weekend protests are planned in 100 US cities. In Los Angeles, 13 people were arrested during a second night of riots. Shops, cars and businesses had windows broken, traffic was blocked and passers-by assaulted.
One of the Jurors yesterday acknowledged the depth of pain that the verdict had caused America. The middle-aged mother of two revealed that half the six-strong panel - five white and one Hispanic, all of them women - initially wanted to convict Mr Zimmerman of second-degree murder or manslaughter.
But after 16 hours of wrangling they agreed that he had not acted out of hatred, and that his use of deadly force was Justified. "If he felt threatened, then his life was going to be taken away from him or he's going to have bodily harm, then he had a right [to shoot]," the woman, known as Juror B37, said.
Mr Zimmerman, who lived in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, wrongly assumed that Trayvon was "up to no good" and reported him to police as "suspicious" and a "f***ing punk" after seeing the black, hoodiewearing boy in his neighbourhood on the night of February 26 last year.
Trayvon, 17, was unarmed and on his way to his father's girlfriend's house. A fight ensued, ending with the shooting.
The Juror, who once held a concealed weapon permit, said: "Both of them are responsible for the situation they got themselves into. I think both of them could have walked away." She announced plans for a book on Monday, but said yesterday a public petition had caused her to change her mind.
