<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that George Zimmerman has been cleared of all charges in the killing of the Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, he intends to reclaim the gun he used to shoot dead the unarmed 17-year-old. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, Mr Zimmerman needs a firearm to protect himself now &quot;even more&quot; than before. Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Mr O'Mara said Mr Zimmerman, 29, &quot;feels, truly in his heart, that if he did not have that weapon [on the night of the shooting] he might not be here&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the heart of Mr Zimmerman's defence was Florida's so-called &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which allowed him not only to carry that gun and to use it, but also to escape being charged by the authorities until six weeks after the killing - and only then due to a public outcry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, which supposedly protects citizens who kill in self-defence, was created not at the behest of concerned Florida citizens, but by the gun lobby: the National Rifle Association (NRA); a powerful right-wing policy group called the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC); and a handful of pliant politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Robert Spitzer, a political scientist and author of several books on the NRA, says: &quot;The real culprit in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case was not Zimmerman, but Stand Your Ground. It's why the police did not investigate aggressively; it's why it took six weeks to bring charges against Zimmerman; and it's why his self-defence claim was extremely difficult to overcome. Stand Your Ground makes not only prosecution, but even mere investigation, very difficult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, the burden is on police and prosecutors to prove that a selfdefence claim is false - often a near-impossible task.</SPAN></P>
