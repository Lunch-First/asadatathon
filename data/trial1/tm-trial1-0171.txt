ONE of six women jurors who cleared George Zimmerman of murdering unarmed teen Trayvon Martin has scrapped plans for a book about the trial.
Woman juror B-37 said she had been shielded from public ``pain'' about the racially charged case as a juror but after seeing the public mood since Zimmerman's acquittal -- which triggered angry protests across the US -- she had decided not to go ahead with the memoir.
