<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 16--&quot;Another tragedy has happened in the judicial system,&quot; Matrina Arellano of the American Indian Movement told the noon rally at the Sister Cities Park across from City Hall. &quot;But there are times when these are the events that bring us together as a community.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working together as a group called &quot;Idle No More,&quot; there were local labor activists, members of the Colorado Progressive Coalition, AIM and others at the rally. They carried signs calling for justice and declaring Zimmerman guilty of killing black teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today we're focusing on the Zimmerman verdict and joining with groups across the nation who are outraged,&quot; said Rita Martinez. &quot;A (federal) civil rights charge has to be brought against Zimmerman. No one thought he would be completely acquitted in what was a clear case of racial profiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arellano said the aftershocks of the Zimmerman case is an opportunity for Pueblo residents to push for changes in local policing. Along with Martinez and others at the rally, she told City Council last week the community needs a citizen review board to investigate complaints of police misconduct and abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She ticked off several recent cases in the community where she called the police response inadequate, including cases of sexual assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an ongoing issue in our community and it has to change,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
