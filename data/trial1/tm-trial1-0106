<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate ends Labor pick filibuster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate voted by the slimmest margin Wednesday to end a filibuster against President Barack Obama's choice to head the Labor Department. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By a 60-40 vote, senators rejected Republican objections and voted to halt delaying tactics aimed at killing Thomas Perez's nomination to become labor secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perez is a top Justice Department official whom Republicans have criticized for his handling of a whistle-blower case against the city of St. Paul, Minn., and for not heeding a congressional subpoena that sought his personal emails in that case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans voting to end the Perez filibuster were Sens. John McCain of Arizona, an architect of this week's deal, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senators reach deal on student loans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heading off a costly increase for returning college students, a bipartisan group of senators reached a deal Wednesday that would offer students better rates on their loans this fall but perhaps assign higher rates in coming years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal would offer students lower interest rates through the 2015 academic year, but then rates were expected to climb above where they were when students left campus this spring. The interest rates would be linked to the financial markets, but Democrats won a protection for students that rates would never climb higher than 8.25 percent for undergraduate students. Graduate students would not pay rates higher than 9.5 percent and parents' rates would top out at 10.5percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the deal, all undergraduates this fall would borrow at 3.85percent interest rates. Graduate students would have access to loans at 5.4percent and parents would be able to borrow at 6.4 percent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon friend gets scholarship offer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some looked at murder trial witness Rachel Jeantel and saw either a defiant young woman or a victim, Tom Joyner looked at her and saw potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nationally syndicated radio personality and philanthropist says he was touched by Jeantel, who spent two days testifying in the trial of George Zimmerman about her last conversation with her friend Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Joyner was so moved that he has offered to pay for Jeantel to attend the historically black college of her choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained the offer in an open letter to Jeantel and &quot;all the young people in this country who, through no fault of their own, find yourself living in underserved communities and not yet figuring out your way in this world.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Man guilty in fatal shooting of teen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Milwaukee man who suspected his 13-year-old neighbor of breaking into his home and stealing weapons was convicted Wednesday of fatally shooting the boy as the teen's mother looked on. Now, jurors will decide whether the 76-year-old defendant was mentally ill at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury deliberated for about an hour before finding John Henry Spooner guilty of first-degree intentional homicide. Surveillance video from his own security cameras showed him confronting Darius Simmons in May 2012, pointing a gun at him from about 6 feet away and shooting him in the chest.</SPAN></P>
