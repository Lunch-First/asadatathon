Monday's question 
President Obama last week suspended the Affordable Care Act's employer mandate, which requires employers with 50 or more workers to offer health care coverage. Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer believes the president violated the Constitution, which requires the president to uphold the law. He says it's unconstitutional for the administration to announce it won't enforce a key provision of an existing law.

Tuesday's question 
The Justice Department says it is looking into the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges against former neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Over the weekend, a Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and other charges. Civil rights organizations have been holding rallies and vigils across the country protesting the verdict.
