<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW YORK (AP) ? Stevie Wonder says he won't perform in Florida and other states with a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law. In a video posted on YouTube, the 63-year-old singer said at a concert in Quebec City, Canada, on Sunday &quot;that until the 'stand your ground' law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again.&quot; Wonder added: &quot;Wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot; The &quot;stand your ground&quot; law allows people to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger. George Zimmerman shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin during a February 2012 confrontation in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman said he fired his gun in self-defense. A six-member jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges on Saturday. Wonder's representative said the singer had no further comment.  </SPAN></P>
