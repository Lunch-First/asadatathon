Now that George Zimmerman has been cleared of all charges in the killing of the Florida teenager TrayvonMartin, he intends to reclaim the gun he used to shoot dead the unarmed 17-year-old. 
According to his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, Mr Zimmerman needs a firearm to protect himself now "even more" than before. Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Mr O'Mara said Mr Zimmerman, 29, "feels, truly in his heart, that if he did not have that weapon [on the night of the shooting] he might not be here".
At the heart of Mr Zimmerman's defence was Florida's so-called "Stand Your Ground" law, which allowed him not only to carry that gun and to use it, but also to escape being charged by the authorities until six weeks after the killing - and only then due to a public outcry.
The law, which supposedly protects citizens who kill in self-defence, was created not at the behest of concerned Florida citizens, but by the gun lobby: the National Rifle Association (NRA); a powerful right-wing policy group called the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC); and a handful of pliant politicians.
Professor Robert Spitzer, a political scientist and author of several books on the NRA, says: "The real culprit in the TrayvonMartin case was not Zimmerman, but Stand Your Ground. It's why the police did not investigate aggressively; it's why it took six weeks to bring charges against Zimmerman; and it's why his self-defence claim was extremely difficult to overcome. Stand Your Ground makes not only prosecution, but even mere investigation, very difficult."
As in the TrayvonMartin case, the burden is on police and prosecutors to prove that a selfdefence claim is false - often a near-impossible task.
