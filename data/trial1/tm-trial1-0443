</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A juror in the George Zimmerman trial broke her silence Monday night on national TV to say Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws played a role in the decision to acquit the Sanford neighborhood watch captain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the woman, identified only as Juror B37, also said she had &quot;no doubt&quot; Zimmerman feared for his life in the final moments of his struggle with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, and that was the definitive factor in the verdict. The juror spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That matched the assessment of legal experts who earlier Monday were describing the verdict on Saturday as the result of successful, garden-variety self-defense arguments that could sway a jury in any state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though these observers said Florida's expanded self-defense law, which says citizens can &quot;stand their ground&quot; rather than retreat in the face of a deadly threat has emboldened citizens to take unnecessary risks and led to an increase in homicides, they detected little impact on the Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, waived his right for a pretrial immunity hearing, allowed under &quot;stand your ground&quot; law. Although the words &quot;stand your ground&quot; were seldom heard during the five-week trial, protesters have called for the repeal of &quot;stand your ground&quot; in light of the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experienced prosecutors and law professors agreed that they think jurors were swayed by basic self-defense arguments made by Zimmerman's attorneys: Regardless of who initiated the encounter, at the moment the deadly shot was fired, Zimmerman feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can see a similar outcome in jurisdictions without 'stand your ground' for the mere fact that the best eyewitness to counter the defense strategy was dead,&quot; said Darren Lenard Hutchinson, a professor of race and civil rights law at the University of Florida Levin College of Law. &quot;That's the terrible reality. The jurors saw a bloodied nose and that may have been enough for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors were also instructed by the judge that if they had &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; about the second-degree murder or manslaughter charges against Zimmerman, they had no choice but to find him not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Dekle, a retired prosecutor who also teaches at UF Law, said, &quot;'Stand your ground' turns out to have been a huge red herring (in the Zimmerman case.) The result very well could have been the same prior to enactment of the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dekle, a critic of &quot;stand your ground&quot; provisions, said that even if a person initiates a fight, they always have had the right to defend themselves if they're in fear of death or great bodily harm. &quot;You don't forfeit your right to do whatever you need to do to live simply because you've been a jerk,&quot; Dekle said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those comments are no surprise to Sen. Tom Lee, Republican from Brandon, who was president of the Florida Senate when stand your ground legislation was passed in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have yet to talk to anyone who believes the stand your ground provisions were remotely relevant to this case,&quot; said Lee, who believes the law is working the way it was intended. &quot;For me, this case centered on your right to defend yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee said that's why the Sanford police did not immediately arrest Zimmerman after he acknowledged killing Martin in February 2012 and why the prosecutor initially decided not to prosecute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But once the prosecution decided to try the case, the questions were:Did Zimmerman have a right to defend himself? Was there an environment that evening that gave a reasonable person belief he or she was in danger? That's traditional self-defense,&quot; Lee said. &quot;He still had a right to defend himself because he was in fear of his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stand your ground&quot; may have had little impact on the criminal case, but it might have repercussions if Martin's parents bring a civil suit against Zimmerman. If Zimmerman was granted immunity under the law by a civil court judge, the Martins would have to pay his legal fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can imagine protesters thinking a civil suit would be the next-best remedy, &quot; said Susan Rozelle, professor at Stetson University College of Law. &quot;But the family is unfairly burdened by the fear of having to pay costs if it loses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though there was some pressure to revamp the stand your ground laws when the Zimmerman case first became public, that pressure quickly dissipated. A task force created by Gov. Rick Scott to review the law included many of the statute's supporters and resulted in few meaningful proposals. Even those, however, failed to get a hearing during the last legislative session, as lawmakers cited the ongoing legal case against Zimmerman and more pressing issues as an excuse for shelving any discussion of the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Chris Smith, a Democrat from Fort Lauderdale, hopes the public outcry over the Zimmerman verdict will change that, especially if jurors say it had an impact on their deliberation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That statute was poorly written; any reasonable society would want it changed,&quot; Smith said. &quot;People are looking for action steps, they're shocked by the outcome. Now we need to push the Legislature to at least have this debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New focus on Florida's 'stand your ground' law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has exonerated dozens of people deemed to be legitimately acting in self-defense - and allowed drug dealers to avoid murder charges and gang members to walk free after shootouts.
