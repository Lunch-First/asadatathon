MAYORAL HOPEFUL William Thompson on Monday defended his provocative comments in the aftermath of the Trayvon Martin verdict, saying he was merely "stating the obvious." 
Shortly after George Zimmerman's acquittal of all charges in Trayvon's death, Thompson sent out this message Saturday night to his 4,200 followers on Twitter:
"Trayvon Martin was killed because he was black. There was no justice done today in Florida."
"I don't think it was an overstatement at all," Thompson, the only African-American running for mayor, said. "If you listened and looked at the trial, it was an unfortunate statement of fact."
Some criticized Thompson's remarks. City Councilman Eric Ulrich (R-Queens) said he would "expect this type of remark from (the Rev. Al Sharpton), not from you."
