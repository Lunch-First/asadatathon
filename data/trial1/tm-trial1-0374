<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD: US President Barack Obama has appealed to Americans for restraint amid anger from civil rights activists and public protests against the acquittal of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury of six women -- reportedly five white and one Hispanic --on the weekend found neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, after a long and racially charged trial that transfixed much of the US for weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second-degree murder, having pursued Trayvon, 17, through a gated community in the town of Sanford, eventually shooting him during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial aroused strong passions and divided those who believed that Mr Zimmerman -- whose father is white and mother is Peruvian -- had racially profiled Trayvon, and those who believed he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spontaneous protests broke out in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta overnight, following the verdict, though they were mostly peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, a large demonstration in New York attracted several thousand people, with placards that read: ``Jail racist killers, not black youth'' and ``We are all Trayvon. The whole damn system is guilty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the marchers in lower Manhattan wore a T-shirt proclaiming: ``I'm black. Please don't shoot?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr Obama, the first black US president, urged people to accept the trial verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,'' Mr Obama said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in Oakland, California, protesters had smashed windows and spray-painted cars after the verdict was announced live</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama had spoken sombrely on Trayvon before, noting that if he had a son he would ``look like Trayvon''.</SPAN></P>
