  A crowd of about 100 people gathered downtown Tuesday for a vigil in reaction to the Florida acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of TrayvonMartin, chanting "Justice for Trayvon" and carrying signs that read "Another world is possible." 
"We felt very compelled to take a stand in Orange County," said Joese Hernandez, 27, an organizer with El Centro Cultural de Mexico in Santa Ana. 
The crowds gathered at Sasscer Park around an altar with Martin's photo next to bags of Skittles and candles.
After 8:30 p.m., protesters peacefully walked down Ross, Main and Fourth streets with candles and fists up in the air. The rally ended after 9 p.m. at the park.
Protesters carried signs reading "We are human, not criminal" while chanting "The people say guilty." A handful of Santa Ana Police Department cars trailed the crowds and monitored traffic.
Hernandez said organizers did not expect unruliness like the Monday night demonstration in Los Angeles. At a news conference Monday night, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said violence and vandalism on city streets had resulted in 13 arrests during a protest over Zimmerman's acquittal. L.A. Police Chief Charlie Beck said about 150 people broke off from a larger, peaceful protest and began committing multiple acts of vandalism and assaults. 
In Santa Ana, "We didn't want to stand aside while the country was marching in solidarity with TrayvonMartin," Hernandez said.
"I think this case is a reminder of the fact that our livelihood is in danger simply because of the color of our skin," said Genesis Hernandez, 19, who was home for summer break from Vassar College in New York.
Another protest for Martin is scheduled in Santa Ana from 6 to 8 p.m. Thursday at 1104 S. Bristol St.
