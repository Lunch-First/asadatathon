THE acquittal of George Zimmerman for the alleged murder of teenager TrayvonMartin has angered many US citizens and celebrities. 
  Zimmerman fatally shot the 17-year-old African-American while in Sanford, Florida in February last year. Prior to the shooting, Zimmerman had said he believed the 17-year-old was behaving in a suspicious manner though, according to the police report, there was no indication that Martin was engaged in criminal activity at the time.  Zimmerman was found not guilty by a Florida jury on Saturday. The Hollywood Reporter stated that Beyonc dedicated Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You and her own song, Halo, to Martin at a show in Nashville.  Rihanna changed her Instagram profile picture to solid black, then posted a picture of the youngster with a message reading: "A child was gunned down for no reason! And nothing about that sounds like murder? My baby brother is 17, this rocked my whole sh*t! #thesystemisandhasalways beenph**ked [sic]."  Vibe magazine reported that Wyclef Jean released a song called Justice (If You're 17) as a tribute to Martin.  US President Barack Obama called for people to respect the verdict.  Selected celebrity tweets: oNicki Minaj (@NICKI MINAJ): "And our taxes paid for that trial. We just paid to see a murderer walk free after killing an innocent unarmed little boy. #GodBlessAmerica." oRick Ross (@Mastermind): "My condolences continue go to the Martin family."  oKim Kardashian (@Kim Kardashian): "My heart goes out to TrayvonMartin's family & loved ones.
