""Re: "'Jury has spoken': Obama" (Gazette, July 15) As a Canadian born in the United States, I was both outraged and disappointed after George Zimmerman was acquitted of the manslaughter and seconddegree murder of Trayvon Martin - an unarmed, black, 17-year-old boy - whom he indisputably killed in February 2012. 
In a case that reeks of racial profiling, Zimmerman, 29, chose to ignore orders by police not to confront Martin, as the teenager was walking to his father's house in a gated community in Florida.
Why was Zimmerman following Martin? Because he considered a black teenager holding a bag of Skittles and an iced tea "suspicious."
The United States had come so far in recent years toward eliminating racism and the unfair treatment of African Americans in their society that this represents a monumental, sad, admission that racism is still alive and well in a country that not 50 years ago, was still making blacks sit at the back of the bus.
