ANGRY protests spread across America on the second day after George Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering an unarmed black teenager. 
Police reportedly fired rubber bullets in Los Angeles while thousands took to the streets in Florida, New York, Washington and Atlanta.
Tensions were running high following the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by the Hispanic Neighbourhood Watch volunteer. The five-week trial of Zimmerman, 29, has divided the US, with many believing the killing in Sanford, Florida, was racially motivated and the investigation biased.
The jury that found him not guilty on Saturday comprised five white and one Hispanic woman and protests are likened to America's original civil rights movement.
President Obama appealed for calm. He said: "I know this has elicited strong passions. But we are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken."
