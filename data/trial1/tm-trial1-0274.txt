July 16--HAYWARD -- A Barstow woman assaulted a revered musician and yelled "It's all your fault!" after he dedicated a song to Trayvon Martin at a Bay Area blues festival, according to police and multiple media reports. 
Dinalynn Andrews Potter, 43, was arrested Saturday by Hayward police on suspicion of battery and then cited and released, according to the San Jose Mercury News.
A records official at the Hayward Police Department, when reached by phone late Monday afternoon, confirmed that the suspect's listed city of residence was Barstow.
Additional calls Monday to the department's public information office for further details were not immediately returned.
It's not clear if charges will be filed against Andrews Potter.
The musician, 73-year-old Lester Chambers, was taken to a Hayward-area hospital, the Mercury News reported.
Chambers' son, Dylan, posted on his personal Facebook page that his father suffered "a bruised rib muscle and nerve damage" and he is "sore all over," but otherwise "OK."
In the 1960s, Chambers was a member of the Chambers Brothers, according to his official website. The group recorded the hit song, "Time Has Come Today."
Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman was cleared of all charges late Saturday night in the shooting of Martin, the unarmed black teenager whose killing unleashed furious debate across the U.S. over racial profiling, self-defense and equal justice.
