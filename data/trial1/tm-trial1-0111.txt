Three of the six jurors in the George Zimmerman trial believed he was guilty of murder or manslaughter when they retired to consider their verdict, one of the all-female panel admitted. The juror disclosed how they were talked out of convicting Mr. Zimmerman for killing Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager. during jury selection, the same woman described the teenager as a "boy of colour" and called the killing "an unfortunate incident that happened." She also described how jurors found the laws "very confusing" and struggled to follow the judge's instructions.
