<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN ANNUAL ceremony honoring the life of the late Mayor Frank Rizzo was canceled yesterday following weekend protests over the acquittal of neighborhood-watch volunteer George Zimmerman in the deadly shooting of Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statue of Rizzo, which sits in front of the Municipal Services Building in Center City, became a focus of protesters, who hung a sign on it Sunday that read, &quot;The system is still racist.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the statue was built in 1998, supporters have gathered there annually on the anniversary of Rizzo's death - July 16 - but organizers agreed Monday evening that it would be best to hold the 22nd annual memorial service another day to avoid any conflict with protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was a tough decision,&quot; organizer Hank Cisco said. &quot;I thought going down there would only incite more problems. I feel that was for the safety of all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman, 29, who identifies himself as Hispanic, shot and killed unarmed Martin, 17, an African-American, in Sanford, Fla., as the teenager was traveling from a corner store last year. Zimmerman was acquitted at the conclusion of the three-week trial over the weekend, sparking protests across the country, spotlighting the issue of racial profiling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cisco and Frank Rizzo Jr., the late mayor's son and a former city councilman, were shocked to see on television news the statue decorated with protesters' signs. Rizzo Sr. had a relatively contentious relationship with the African-American community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rizzo Jr. agreed that organizers made the right decision to delay the ceremony. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My dad would want that, as a guy who promoted peace,&quot; Rizzo said, adding, &quot;I'm disappointed, but I'd be more disappointed if something took away from that day.&quot; </SPAN></P>
