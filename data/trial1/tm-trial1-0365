<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests continued yesterday across the United States after George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer accused of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager, was cleared of all charges against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities had asked the residents of Sanford, Florida, where the killing and subsequent trial took place, to keep the peace after hearing the verdict on Sunday in a case that has gripped the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday the riots feared by the police failed to materialise, but peaceful protests had been reported as far afield as Washington, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta and San Francisco. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York, hundreds of protesters marched into Times Square, zigzagging through the streets to avoid police lines. Marchers thronged the busy intersection, chanting &quot;Justice for! Trayvon&nbsp;Martin!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In San Francisco and Los Angeles - where an earlier protest was dispersed with beanbag rounds - police closed streets as protesters marched to condemn Zimmerman&quot;s acquittal. In Los Angeles, around 200 demonstrators gathered for a vigil in one of the city&quot;s African-American neighbourhoods, Leimert Park. Police in Oakland, California, said a small crowd took to the streets, with some breaking windows, spraying anti-police graffiti and burning US and California state flags.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, about 200 protesters marched with signs that said &quot;racism is not dead&quot; and &quot;who&quot;s next?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, is now a free man, but the Justice Department said it is looking into Martin&quot;s death to determine whether federal prosecutors will file criminal civil rights charges against his killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With many critics angry over Zimmerman&quot;s acquittal, his freedom may be limited. He may also face civil lawsuits from Martin&quot;s family. &quot;He&quot;s going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,&quot; his brother, Robert Zimmerman told CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama called Martin&quot;s death a tragedy for America but asked that everyone respect calls for calm reflection. &quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department opened an investigation into Martin&quot;s death last year but stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department yesterday said the criminal section of its civil rights division, the FBI and the local US Attorney&quot;s office are continuing to evaluate the evidence. Experience has shown it&quot;s not easy getting convictions in such high-profile prosecutions. Alan Vinegrad, a former US Attorney, said federal prosecutors &quot;would have to show not only that the attack was unjustified, but that Mr Zimmerman attacked Mr Martin because of his race and because he was using a public facility, the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was race important?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman&quot;s opponents believe he followed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because he was a young black man wearing a hoodie. Zimmerman told police he had seen someone and told the dispatcher: &quot;F****** punks. These assholes, they always get away.&quot; He was ruled to have shot Trayvon in self-defence. Cuts and bruises on Zimmerman&quot;s head showed the pair had fought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So is self-defence plausible?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a 911 call made by one of Zimmerman&quot;s neighbours as the pair were fighting, a voice pleads for help. The prosecution said this was Trayvon. The defence said it was Zimmerman. Neither side was able to prove who was speaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the witnesses?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&quot;s friend, Rachel Jeantel, on the phone with him not long before he died, said he kept complaining that a man was watching him. She heard Trayvon tell someone to &quot;get off&quot; before the line went dead. An expert defence witness claimed the angle of the shot that killed Martin proved he was on top of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
