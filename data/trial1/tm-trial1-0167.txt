George Zimmerman was acquitted by a jury of his own peers in the death of Trayvon Martin. He was in fear for his life and being brutally attacked when he defended himself. 
O.J. Simpson was acquitted by a jury of his own peers in the brutal murder of his ex-wife and her male friend. He was later found culpable in a civil trial.
Where were all of the vigilantes at that time? The majority of the American public accepted the fact that even though our judicial system is not perfect they must accept the findings of the courts. Maybe our politicians and those others bowing to the pressure of the violent protesters should do the same.
