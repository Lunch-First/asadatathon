<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Zimmerman Is Acquitted in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Killing'' (front page, July 14):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I learned of the not guilty verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman, my first reaction was one of sympathy for the family members of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. They were dealt a life sentence of pain, never knowing precisely what happened on that fateful night because the only person alive to tell the story is the one who shot their son to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury, which sifted through a mountain of testimony and evidence, obviously concluded that Mr. Zimmerman acted in self-defense, that it was his voice heard on tape crying for help. Its verdict must be accepted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcome in the case creates no winners. The Martin family has lost a son under the worst circumstances, and Mr. Zimmerman, who will always be believed guilty of murder by many, can go nowhere within this country without being recognized and disparaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our nation, which has followed the case with intense interest, is left to wonder what would have happened had Mr. Zimmerman left police work to the police, as a dispatcher had asked him to do.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the rhetoric on both sides, the criminal justice system sometimes works as it is supposed to. George Zimmerman should have been charged. He ignored a direct police order not to follow Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, he initiated the encounter, and he intentionally shot and killed an unarmed teenager. His statements about the events were inconsistent, and there was evidence he was the aggressor. In legal terms, there was definitely ''probable cause'' to charge Mr. Zimmerman with second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution presented its case, warts and all (with a few self-inflicted wounds no doubt), and the jury unanimously decided that there was not proof beyond a reasonable doubt of Mr. Zimmerman's guilt. Whether one likes the results or not, based on an objective assessment of the evidence, the jurors made the right decision. In short, the case played out as it should have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now let's hope the civil justice system works just as well, and Mr. Zimmerman is sued, found liable and forced to pay damages.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous studies show that the presence of even one minority juror changes for the better how the jury as a whole deliberates. Representative juries consider more evidence from more points of view with more collective recall of the facts. This makes it imperative to consider why jury selection in the George Zimmerman trial, like jury selection in so many counties in the United States, continues to underrepresent African-Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African-Americans make up about 11.8 percent of the population of Seminole County, from which the Zimmerman jury was drawn, but not a single African-American made it onto the actual jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have no objective measure of what counts as a ''right'' verdict in the Zimmerman case. All we have are reasons to believe that the jury works well when it has the democratic credentials to speak for the whole community. No matter how well intentioned the Zimmerman jurors were as individuals, they did not form a democratic whole.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An important lesson in the George Zimmerman case is largely ignored. It doesn't matter if you are a private citizen, a neighborhood watch captain or a community watch coordinator. If you see something suspicious, don't intervene; call 911. Let the professionals deal with the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most likely outcome is, if indeed the suspicious person has larceny on his mind, he will leave when the police come by. A crime prevented is better than a crime being prosecuted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer is a community watch coordinator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial of George Zimmerman focused largely on who was the aggressor in the physical fight they had. But some people did not even entertain the possibility that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin may have been acting in self-defense -- that's where racism comes in. He was the one being followed by an armed man for no apparent reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I realize that Mr. Zimmerman may have erroneously thought that Mr. Martin was a threat, this incident illustrates why if one is not under immediate threat, it is best to leave these matters to the police. The last thing we need is rampant untrained citizen vigilantism, or we are bound to have more Trayvon&nbsp;Martins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEBORAH MORAN Houston, July 14, 2013</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racial dimensions of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case have been explored at length. What is rarely mentioned is what is most obvious about this tragic incident: George Zimmerman was walking around a common area (not his own personal property) with a loaded handgun when he confronted Mr. Martin. This is legal in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A citizen ''on patrol'' should be armed with a cellphone and nothing more. Had this been the case, Mr. Martin would be alive. End of story.</SPAN></P>
