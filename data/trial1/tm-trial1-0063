<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-member jury that acquitted neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman did not believe race played a role in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, the first juror to speak publicly about the trial says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror, identified only as Juror B37, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday night she and the other jurors believed the screaming voice captured on a 911 recording belonged to Zimmerman, and lent little credibility to a key witness who spoke to Martin on the phone before he died. They also put limited faith in the testimony provided by Martin's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said anything a mother and father would say,&quot; said the juror, who said she wanted to keep her identity secret and was almost invisible in deep shadow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 said she believed Martin was the aggressor - and added she had &quot;no doubt&quot; that Zimmerman feared for his life during the confrontation in a Sanford, Florida, housing complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think his heart was in the right place,&quot; she said of Zimmerman. &quot;It just went terribly wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think he's guilty of something?&quot; Cooper pressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he's guilty of not using good judgment,&quot; she responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, the juror said, was &quot;overeager to help people&quot;. She added that she believed he was &quot;was pretty consistent and told the truth&quot; to investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Juror B37 said she was sympathetic to Zimmerman throughout the trial, she said the jury was initially divided. Three members of the all-female jury wanted to find Zimmerman not guilty, two believed a manslaughter verdict was appropriate, and one supported a finding of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All six members found the law to be &quot;very confusing&quot;, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after reading the definitions of second-degree murder and manslaughter &quot;over and over&quot;, the jurors reached consensus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had a right to defend himself,&quot; Juror B37 said of Zimmerman. &quot;If he felt threatened, that his life was going to be taken away from him or he was going to have bodily harm, he had a right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before ending her interview with Cooper, Juror B37 broke down in tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want people to know that we put everything into everything to get this verdict,&quot; she said. &quot;We didn't just go in there and say, we're going to do guilty/not guilty. We thought about it for hours and cried over it afterwards. I don't think any of us could ever do anything like that ever again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is known about Juror B37 came from her comments as she was being interviewed by both sides before the trial began, that she is middle-aged, has two grown children, once had a license to carry a concealed weapon and worked for a chiropractor for 16 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite keeping her identity secret, Juror B37 has already secured an agent to peddle an as-yet unwritten book.</SPAN></P>
