The Reverend Al Sharpton, the veteran civil rights leader, has called for a "Justice for Trayvon National Day of Action" on Saturday and said protests are planned in more than 100 cities across America. 
Police in California made several arrests on Monday evening as demonstrations continued against the acquittal of neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who shot and killed 17-year-old TrayvonMartin following an altercation in a gated Florida housing community in February last year.
The call for action followed the admission by one female juror that three of her fellow members were initially inclined to convict Mr Zimmerman. The woman, known only as Juror B-37, offered a glimpse behind the scenes of the jury's deliberations in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper.
She explained how, after 16 hours of discussion, the six women came to the conclusion that Mr Zimmerman, ought to be acquitted of the seconddegree murder of the black teenager Trayvon, whom he claimed to have shot in self-defence. "There was a couple of them in there that wanted to find him guilty of something," she said. "And after hours and hours and hours of deliberating over the law, and reading it over and over and over again, we just decided there's no other way or place to go [but acquittal]."
Juror B-37 is a white, middle-aged chiropractor from Seminole County in Florida, where the shooting and subsequent trial took place.
In the first poll of the six jurors, she explained, three favoured finding Mr Zimmerman not guilty, two voted for manslaughter and one for seconddegree murder. She said that the jury worked hard to reach a verdict, and cried over the decision.
"I want people to know that we put everything into it," she said. "We thought about it over and over."
Civil rights activists have urged the US Department of Justice to investigate the killing as a racially motivated hate crime. Juror B-37 said the panel, five of whom were white, did not believe that race was a factor.
