RIHANNA has spoken out after George Zimmerman was cleared of murdering unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.
She took to Instagram after he walked free over the shooting, ranting that the US criminal justice system was ``ph...ed.'' ``A child was gunned down for no reason!'' she wrote. ``And nothing about that sounds like murder?'' 
BECKS AND CALL
David name for a prince
DAVID Beckham has come up with a name for the royal baby, but it's not creative.
He told Sky News: ``David's pretty good, if it's a boy of course.'' He and wife Victoria attended Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 wedding, and says they will be ``amazing'' parents.
NO ROLES
Claire tells of hard time
DESPITE winning an Emmy for Temple Grandin in 2010, Claire Danes says she then struggled to find work, and at one point considered giving up.
``It was grim. I was very hurt,'' the 34-year-old tells Vogue. ``Two years of not working was brutal. And a point came where I thought, `I really like interior design'. Someone suggested `Maybe your real success is in your personal life'.''
Luckily, she won the role of Carrie Mathison on Homeland, which returns for its third season in September in the US.
