PROTESTS are continuing to spread across the US -- with at least one turning violent -- following the not-guilty verdict for George Zimmerman after he shot teenager TrayvonMartin dead . 
Demonstrations, from Florida where the trial took place to Atlanta, DC, and New York, remained peaceful last night -- although violence erupted in Oakland, California.
In Oakland, a hotbed of racial tension, some protesters turned violent -- vandalising police cars, breaking windows and setting fire to garbage.
One photo from the protests in the city shows men dousing an American flag in lighter fluid and setting it alight.
At least three separate protests were scheduled for New York City -- one in lower Manhattan, one in Harlem and a third in Brooklyn.
The Oakland demonstration followed a raucous but largely peaceful rally in San Francisco.
The verdict also sparked protests in Los Angeles, where demonstrators gathered in Leimert Park, the city's historically black neighbourhood.
Police were put on tactical alert, but there were no reports of any arrests.
Celebrities continued to address the verdict, with pop superstar Beyonce stopping her Mrs Carter Show World Tour concert at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, to honour the slain teen.
Her concert started about 30 minutes after the Zimmerman verdict began to circulate.
``I'd like to have a moment of silence for Trayvon,'' the pop star said.
Beyonce then sang the chorus of Dolly Parton's I Will Always Love You, before transitioning into her hit Halo.
Fellow celeb Rihanna took to Twitter to express her celebrity outrage, tweeting, 'This is the saddest news ever!!! #whatsjustice.'
