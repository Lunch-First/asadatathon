<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirteen people have been arrested after violence and vandalism erupted during protests over the acquittal of a neighbourhood watch volunteer over the shooting of an unarmed black teenager, US officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 29, was found not guilty by a jury on Saturday night. He said he shot Trayvon Martin in self-defence in a night-time confrontation at his gated community in Sanford, Florida, where the 17-year-old was visiting his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a news conference with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said about 150 people broke off from a larger, peaceful protest and began walking through the streets, committing multiple acts of vandalism and several assaults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not give any details about the incidents or any potential injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Beck said more than 300 officers were called to the scene but they held back from directly engaging with the protesters in an attempt to allow a peaceful end to the demonstration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he warned that officers would adopt a much stricter stance if the protests continued for another night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least one person was injured and police made nine arrests when another protest turned violent in Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspapers reported that a waiter guarding windows at a restaurant was hit in the face with a hammer, and protesters threw fireworks at police in riot gear, while police deployed stun grenades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokeswoman Johnna Watson said the arrests were for crimes including assault with a deadly weapon and vandalism.</SPAN></P>
