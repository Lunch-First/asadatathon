America's first black Attorney-General last night denounced the country's "stand-your-ground" laws following the acquittal of a Neighbourhood Watch volunteer in Florida over the killing of a black teenager. 
Addressing civil rights leaders, Eric Holder acknowledged the passions stirred by the racially tinged trial of George Zimmerman, who was found not guilty at the weekend of murdering Trayvon Martin.
"Separate and apart from the case that has drawn the nation's attention, it's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defence and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods," he said.
A million Americans have heaped pressure on Mr Holder by demanding that Trayvon's killer be prosecuted for a hate crime.Weekend protests are planned in 100 US cities. In Los Angeles, 13 people were arrested during a second night of riots. Shops, cars and businesses had windows broken, traffic was blocked and passers-by assaulted.
One of the Jurors yesterday revealed that half the six-strong panel - five white and one Hispanic, all of them women - initially wanted to convict Mr Zimmerman of second-degree murder or manslaughter. But after 16 hours of wrangling they agreed that he had not acted out of hatred, and that his use of deadly force was Justified. "If he felt threatened, then his life was going to be taken away from him or he's going to have bodily harm, then he had a right [to shoot]," the woman, a middle-aged mother of two who once held a concealed weapon permit, said.
Florida is one of 30 states to have adopted "stand-your-gound" laws that Justify homicide in self-defence.
Mr Zimmerman, who lived in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, wrongly assumed that Trayvon was "up to no good" on the night of February 26 last year.
Trayvon, 17, was unarmed and on his way to his father's girlfriend's house. A fight ensued, ending with the shooting.
