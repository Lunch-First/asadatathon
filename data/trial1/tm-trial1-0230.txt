Thirteen people have been arrested after violence and vandalism erupted during protests over the acquittal of a neighbourhood watch volunteer over the shooting of an unarmed black teenager, US officials said. 
George Zimmerman, 29, was found not guilty by a jury on Saturday night. He said he shot Trayvon Martin in self-defence in a night-time confrontation at his gated community in Sanford, Florida, where the 17-year-old was visiting his family.
Speaking at a news conference with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said about 150 people broke off from a larger, peaceful protest and began walking through the streets, committing multiple acts of vandalism and several assaults.
He did not give any details about the incidents or any potential injuries.
Mr Beck said more than 300 officers were called to the scene but they held back from directly engaging with the protesters in an attempt to allow a peaceful end to the demonstration.
However, he warned that officers would adopt a much stricter stance if the protests continued for another night.
At least one person was injured and police made nine arrests when another protest turned violent in Oakland.
Newspapers reported that a waiter guarding windows at a restaurant was hit in the face with a hammer, and protesters threw fireworks at police in riot gear, while police deployed stun grenades.
Police spokeswoman Johnna Watson said the arrests were for crimes including assault with a deadly weapon and vandalism.
