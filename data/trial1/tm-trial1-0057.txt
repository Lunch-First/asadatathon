We Americans can consider ourselves a tolerant and open society when we can have a trial of a black person accused of murdering a white person or a white accused of murdering a black person in a court with a mixed jury that can render a fair decision on the merits of the case. Until then we need laws that attempt to keep us all conscious of our prejudices with legal parameters to keep us in line.  
In this regard, I feel the recent Supreme Court decision was flawed; we still need to work on fair voting rights. My heart goes out to Trayvon Martin's family. MARTHA H. JONES Boulder
