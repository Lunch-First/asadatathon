Text of report by Iranian conservative news agency Mehr
Tehran, 17 July: In reaction to the acquittal of the assailant of a black American, the Foreign Ministry spokesman [Seyyed Abbas Araqchi] said: "The acquittal of the murderer [George Zimmerman] of the black American teenager [Trayvon Martin] has, again, openly displayed an unwritten, but systematic, racism against ethnic and religious minorities in the US society."   
According to Mehr news agency, Seyyed Abbas Araqchi said that the verdict has raised a serious question about the fairness of the judicial procedures in the United States, and added: "After several months of investigations, the public opinion in America and the world expects to see transparency, careful and fair judicial probes, commitment to the human rights principles regarding the US citizens, and prohibition of any discrimination against minorities in that country." 
Araqchi said: "Pubic opinion interprets such kind of judicial practice as the continuation of some measures such as the suspicious death of [Malcolm Latif] Shabazz, the grandson of Malcolm X, which had been tried to sink the case into oblivion without any professional probes."
He added: "The Islamic Republic of Iran, in line with public opinion, advises the US government and judicial bodies to remain committed to their international and human rights duties in the country, particularly regarding minorities, and to take practical measures in order to put an end to discriminatory behaviours."
