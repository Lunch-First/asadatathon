<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't see why so many people are making such a big deal about the Trayvon Martin case. Regardless of the racial inference, it's just another example of a law abiding citizen being killed by another law abiding citizen with a gun. (In this case, of course, the law abiding citizen also had a concealed carry permit and a 'stand your ground' law, a lethal combination.) Yes, George Zimmerman was, and still is, a law abiding citizen, and he still has his gun.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what's the big deal? These tragedies happen every day in this country. As they say, guns don't kill people. People with guns kill people. And as more law abiding citizens get more and more guns, more and more law abiding citizens will be killed.<BR><BR> DENNIS McDANIEL<BR><BR> Boulder  </SPAN></P>
