<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the interest in the George Zimmerman verdict and the fact that the NAACP and other groups are demanding federal action, we don't blame the Justice Department for assessing whether criminal civil rights charges might be legitimate now that Zimmerman has been acquitted. But we're deeply skeptical of proceeding with further charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same problems that hobbled the state in its pursuit of Zimmerman would face the Justice Department, beginning with the lack of witnesses to the deadly confrontation between Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there would be new problems, too. A civil rights charge would presumably require evidence that Zimmerman acted out of racial bias. Yet if hard evidence of such bigotry failed to surface in the past year and a half, it's hard to believe it would come to light now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, the Justice Department has played an important role historically in filing federal charges when a clear miscarriage of justice seems to have occurred in a case involving race. But if there was a miscarriage of justice here, it certainly isn't obvious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury's conclusions could not have been shocking to anyone who followed the case with an open mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, open minds and fair-minded attitudes have not been the hallmarks of the Trayvon Martin phenomenon since it burst into the national consciousness last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the trial, it became clear the state overreached in charging Zimmerman with second-degree murder, setting up unrealistic expectations among many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department should heed that lesson before taking on what would appear to be a long-shot prosecution.</SPAN></P>
