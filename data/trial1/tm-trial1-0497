<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department said Sunday it is looking into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin to determine whether federal prosecutors will file criminal civil rights charges now that George Zimmerman has been acquitted in the state case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department opened an investigation into Martin's death last year but stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the Justice Department said the criminal section of its civil rights division, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office for the Middle District of Florida are continuing to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal probe, in addition to the evidence and testimony from the state trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction,&quot; the statement said. Justice added that it will determine &quot;whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the Rodney King case in Los Angeles to the Algiers Motel incident in Detroit more than four decades ago, the Justice Department has a long history of using federal civil rights law in an effort to convict defendants who have previously been acquitted in related state cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous started a petition calling for the Justice Department to open a civil rights case against Zimmerman for the shooting death of 17-year-old Martin, but experience has shown it's almost never easy getting convictions in such high-profile prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Justice Department would face significant challenges in bringing a federal civil rights case against Mr. Zimmerman,&quot; said Alan Vinegrad, the former U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York. &quot;There are several factual and legal hurdles that federal prosecutors would have to overcome: They'd have to show not only that the attack was unjustified, but that Mr. Zimmerman attacked Mr. Martin because of his race and because he was using a public facility, the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the last element, the confrontation between Zimmerman and the shooting victim occurred in a gated community, which may not fit the legal definition of a public facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lauren Resnick, a former federal prosecutor in New York who successfully prosecuted a man in the killing of an Orthodox Jew during the 1991 Crown Heights riots in Brooklyn, said the Justice Department could conceivably proceed under a theory that Zimmerman interfered with Martin's right to walk down a public street based on his race. But that would be challenging, she said, because it would require prosecutors to prove, among other things, that trailing Martin on the street constituted interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One could argue it did, if it freaked him out and he couldn't comfortably walk down the street - there's an argument here,&quot; said Resnick, who now specializes in white-collar criminal defense and commercial litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she said federal prosecutors were likely to encounter the same hurdles as state prosecutors in establishing that Zimmerman was driven by racial animus and was the initial aggressor, as opposed to someone who acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you have a fact pattern where one person's alive, and one person's not, and the person alive is the defendant, it's hard to prove things beyond a reasonable doubt,&quot; said Resnick. She also said it was easier to prove a criminal bias in the Crown Heights killing than it would be in any federal prosecution of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
