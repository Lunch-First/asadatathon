Re: Holder Calls For Dialogue On Race, July 16. u.S. attorney-general eric Holder says the fatal shooting death of Trayvon Martin is "an opportunity to have a 'difficult dialogue' on racially charged issues."
yes, by all means have this dialogue. Start with how an attorney-general, a u.S. president ("If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon") and u.S. media (who, after learning George Zimmerman self-describes himself as Hispanic after his mom, invented the term "white-Hispanic") that made a non-racial incident into one solely about race.
