PASADENA>> First African Methodist Episcopal Church will hold a prayer vigil and peaceful protest Wednesday to protest the not guilty verdict in the George Zimmerman trial. 
The protest will begin at 6 p.m. with a Bible study, then participants will write letters to elected officials and the Martin family. The evening will culminate with a march through the streets of Pasadena followed by a prayer vigil. Participants plan to wear hoodies.
"We will no longer be bystanders to the scapegoating and targeting of the poor, black, brown and marginalized brothers and sisters of our local and larger communities," the church states on its website.
Rallies have continued throughout Los Angeles and the nation since Zimmerman was acquitted Saturday. Zimmerman admitted shooting Martin in Florida, but jurors ruled his actions were in self defense.
