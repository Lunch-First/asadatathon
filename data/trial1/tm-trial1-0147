<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been haunted by the facts that emerged from the trial of George Zimmerman and the killing of Trayvon Martin. The facts that emerged are tragic -- both for young Trayvon Martin and for our nation. Something is wrong with our laws, our system of justice, our society's priorities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grown man with a gun can profile, follow and ultimately shoot dead a 17-year-old kid and it's not against the law -- at least in Florida. This tragedy is not the jury's fault; they followed the law, and while I don't like their verdict, I do respect it. The heartbreaking truth is that the responsibility for this failure of justice lies with all of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not enough to be mad; it's not enough to be sad; we must change our laws, our system of justice and the cultural values that invite such tragic events. The underlying problems of racial inequality and gun violence continue to plague our nation.</SPAN></P>
