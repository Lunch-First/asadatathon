<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD: US President Barack Obama has appealed to Americans for restraint amid anger from civil rights activists and public protests against the acquittal of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury comprising six women - reportedly five white and a hispanic - on Sunday found neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, after a long and racially-charged trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second-degree murder, having pursued Martin, 17, through a gated community in the town of Sanford, eventually shooting him during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial aroused strong passions and divided those who believed that Zimmerman - whose father is white and mother is Peruvian - had racially-profiled Martin, and those who believed he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests broke out in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta following the verdict, though they were mostly peaceful. A large demonstration in New York yesterday attracted thousands of people, with placards that read, ``Jail racist killers, not black youth'', and ``We are all Trayvon. The whole damn system is guilty''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Obama, the first black US president, urged people to accept the trial verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,'' Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, California, protesters smashed windows and spray-painted cars after the verdict was announced live on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents - father Tracy and mother Sybrina Fulton - had before the trial asked the public to respect the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martin family's lawyer, Benjamin Crump, declined to say whether they would file a civil lawsuit against Zimmerman, but said ``they are going to certainly look at that as an option''.</SPAN></P>
