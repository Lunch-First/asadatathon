PASADENA>> Pasadena police were ready to provide mutual aid Tuesday in the event that surrounding cities needed assistance to handle rallies protesting the not guilty verdict in the George Zimmerman trial. 
Police spokeswoman Lt. Tracey Ibarra said officers who normally wear civilian clothes were dressed in police uniforms and ready for a quick response if needed.
"We don't have any events here that have necessitated an increased response, but those agencies around us, if they have an event and they need our resources we are just prepared to respond in a more timely fashion," Ibarra said.
Since Saturday, rallies supporting Trayvon Martin, the unarmed teenager Zimmerman shot and killed in Florida, have continued in Los Angeles streets, causing Los Angeles police and officials to ask the public for peace.
