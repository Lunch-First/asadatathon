<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAYORAL HOPEFUL William Thompson on Monday defended his provocative comments in the aftermath of the Trayvon Martin verdict, saying he was merely &quot;stating the obvious.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after George Zimmerman's acquittal of all charges in Trayvon's death, Thompson sent out this message Saturday night to his 4,200 followers on Twitter:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon Martin was killed because he was black. There was no justice done today in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it was an overstatement at all,&quot; Thompson, the only African-American running for mayor, said. &quot;If you listened and looked at the trial, it was an unfortunate statement of fact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some criticized Thompson's remarks. City Councilman Eric Ulrich (R-Queens) said he would &quot;expect this type of remark from (the Rev. Al Sharpton), not from you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson's tweet was seen as out of character for the cautious candidacy he has run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Quinnipiac poll released Monday showed that Thompson is in third place among black Democrats.</SPAN></P>
