<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may not be possible to consider the case of George Zimmerman, who was acquitted on Saturday of all charges in the killing of Trayvon Martin, as anything but a sad commentary on the state of race relations and the battle over gun rights in America today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly it is about race - ask any black man, up to and including President Barack Obama, and he will tell you at least a few stories that sound eerily like what happened on that rainy winter night in Sanford, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury reached its verdict after having been asked to consider Zimmerman's actions in light of Florida's now-notorious Stand Your Ground statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under that law, a person may use deadly force if he or she &quot;reasonably believes&quot; it is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm - a low bar that the prosecutors in this case fought in vain to overcome. These laws sound intuitive: who would argue that you may not protect yourself against great harm? But of course, the concept of &quot;reasonable belief&quot; is transformed into something deadly when firearms are involved. And when the law intersects with lax concealed-carry laws, it works essentially to self-deputise anyone with a Kel-Tec 9mm and a grudge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been a bad year for gun control. But if anything, cases like this should be as troubling as the mass killings that always prompt a national outcry and promises of legislative remedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is most frightening is that there are so many people with guns who are like Zimmerman. Fear and racism may not be fully eliminated by legislative or judicial order, but neither should laws allow their most deadly expression. Martin was an unarmed boy walking home. If only Florida could give him back his life as easily as it is giving back Zimmerman's gun. - New York Times 8P8</SPAN></P>
