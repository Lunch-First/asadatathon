<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did the system work? Was justice served? We like to think of those questions as identical. After all, the point of a criminal justice system is to dispense justice. But with the acquittal of George Zimmerman on charges of murdering Trayvon Martin, the system worked yet justice fell short. &lt;0x000A&gt;     This outcome is simultaneously sad but healthy - sad because a 17-year-old boy is dead and his killer walks free; healthy because the verdict seems justified as a matter of law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an important place for emotion in criminal proceedings, both for mercy and for outrage. But the system cannot function if it consistently elevates emotion over rules.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides, naturally, see the Zimmerman verdict through the lens of their own preconceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This will confirm for many that the only problem with the New South is it occupies the same time and space as the Old South,&quot; said NAACP President Benjamin Jealous, invoking the memory of 14-year-old Emmett Till, killed in 1955 after supposedly flirting with a white woman and his murderers acquitted. &quot;Old South justice,&quot; thundered Jesse Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This comparison is unfair. No doubt that race played a role in Martin's death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman likely would not have called the police about a white teenager - even a white teenager wearing a hoodie - walking back from the 7-Eleven. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is no evidence that race played a role in Zimmerman's acquittal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anything, the racial undertones worked against Zimmerman, increasing public pressure on prosecutors to bring the most serious and, in hindsight, difficult to support, charges against him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrast the Zimmerman trial with that of Till's murderers. The courtroom was segregated. No hotel would rent rooms to black observers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local sheriff welcomed black spectators to the courtroom with what was described as a cheerful use of the vilest racial epithet. The New South is not perfect, but it is not the Old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overreaction from the left is mirrored by the overreaction from the right, and without the excuse of being swept away by emotion over a child's unnecessary death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative Roger L. Simon lamented on PJ Media that Zimmerman &quot;will never live a normal life&quot; and described the prosecution as &quot;quite literally, the first American Stalinist 'show trial.' &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is, quite literally, deranged. Of course no decent person responsible for killing an unarmed teenager could &quot;live a normal life.&quot; And the entire point of &quot;show trials&quot; was that the outcome, unlike Zimmerman's acquittal, was foreordained. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which brings us back to the uncomfortable divide between the criminal justice system and justice itself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way to understand that gap is to think of the episode as a video. The criminal justice system zooms in, and properly so, on one short segment, a snapshot in the larger narrative. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever preceded the fight between the two men, the central question, as a matter of criminal law, was precisely what occurred in the immediate moments before Zimmerman fired the fatal shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman instigated the tragic chain of events, but legally that was not relevant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder, prosecutors had to prove that he did something that he knew was &quot;reasonably certain&quot; to kill or seriously injure and acted with &quot;ill will, hatred, spite or an evil intent.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even for the lesser charge of manslaughter, they had to rebut his claim of self-defense, showing that he could not &quot;reasonably believe&quot; shooting Martin was &quot;necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice takes the longer time frame. Zimmerman may not be legally responsible for Martin's death but he remains morally culpable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another way to understand the divide is through the prism of legal rules, which may serve the broader ends of justice but produce unjust results in the short run. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus the exclusionary rule for illegally seized evidence, meaning that some criminals go free because the constable has blundered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, the law's requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt for criminal convictions presumes tolerance for a certain amount of unjust results. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We accept the bargain, in Blackstone's formulation, that it is &quot;better that ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal is not the end of this sad story. Because of the lower burden of proof, a civil lawsuit by Martin's family would have a better chance of success. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal prosecution on civil rights charges would be a mistake; the state trial failed to show adequate evidence of racial animus to sustain such a case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, society must accept: There is not always a perfect fit between a criminal justice system and justice.</SPAN></P>
