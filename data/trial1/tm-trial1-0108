<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verdict no surprise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, a new twist to the George Zimmerman trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The unthinkable&quot; verdict of Zimmerman not being guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanford police chief didn't want to charge him because of lack of evidence, the county district attorney didn't want to charge him for lack of evidence. So the state DA stepped in from much pressure from above and with what seemed like much delight, charged him with second degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was found not guilty of all charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Were they surprised?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This travesty could not have happened without the help of a biased media and two racists named Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton. In the beginning they fanned the flames of unrest with their claims of white on black racism. At the end they called for peace and not violence. Look at me in the beginning and look at me at the end. A win-win for Jackson and Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they weren't so busy spreading hatred to their &quot;sheep,&quot; they might have to go out and get a job like the rest of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Schriver<BR>Salinas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outrage spurred investigation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's remember why the Trayvon Martin murder case was so important. Our current laws find a dead black teenager of so little value that no investigation of his death would have taken place if people hadn't spoken out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This took 44 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This teenager was casually walking home   &quot;meandering,&quot; as my mother used to call it   talking with a friend when a creepy guy begins following him. Minutes later this teen was shot in the heart. All that love, pride, care, future and hope of his parents, bleeding out on the ground. All the pain settling in to haunt them the remainder of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can't bear to think of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you believe this same slow-to-justice scenario would have occurred with a white teen, you're not facing reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, we've made many strides, but there are many still to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vicki Dwyer<BR>Pacific Grove</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make a fire museum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A solution for the Museum of Monterey is to utilize the building as a fire museum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The museum would house, at no cost, all the historical antique fire apparatus, equipment and photographs that are now stored throughout the cities of Monterey, Pacific Grove and Carmel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fire department was the social club of the Monterey Peninsula, and its members consisted of some of the most prominent individuals who lived here. Many of these individuals were influential in making the Peninsula the destination spot it has become, but a majority of the locals and tourists are not aware of the real history of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fire museum will attract many visitors as it is unique to the local area and a place parents will take their children   after all, children like fire engines. The museum would be a place where school children could learn the history of the fire departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to preserve the history for future generations or we will lose it over time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Ventimiglia<BR>Del Rey Oaks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A question about bull horns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I looked with interest at your picture of the bull and rider in the July 16 edition of The Herald and could not help but notice that the bull had its horns cut off, and was wondering the why of that. Would it not be better to have capped the horns? I don't know but I am just asking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know the old saying, &quot;You play with the bull, you get the horns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle Portlock<BR>Salinas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Help rebuild the Alisal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congratulations to the Acosta Plaza Homeowners Association for advocating for more green space instead of more apartments. What we need in the Alisal is more single family homes with a backyard where children can safely play. We have hundreds of apartments with no recreation area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been much talk about the future growth area, but not enough on how we can redevelop blighted neighborhoods where people live. Realizing it is more expensive to redevelop than to develop, we need to fix what we currently have and not let it get worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alisal is a strong financial hub, but it is known more for the &quot;bad side of town.&quot; Most of our workforce in the hospitality Industry for the Monterey Peninsula and the farmworkers for the Salinas Valley that produce the $6 billion agriculture industry live here. These are hardworking people wanting to improve the quality of life for themselves and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I encourage you to stand together with the Acosta Plaza Homeowners Association in advocating for Parks and Recreation to improve their neighborhood because improvements made here in this densely populated neighborhood will have a positive ripple effect in the entire city of Salinas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A serene night at the aquarium</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candlelit tables surrounded by beautiful and exotic creatures, a chance to explore nooks and crannies usually too crowded to enjoy, rhythmic music off in the distance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hawaii?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Caribbean?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No! The Monterey Bay Aquarium on members night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kudos to the staff who worked hard to bring this gift to its members, as we recognize the aquarium is a gift to the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you all.</SPAN></P>
