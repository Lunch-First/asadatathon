The outcome of the Trayvon Martin case was based on our court system reviewing facts and circumstantial evidence. There are those who agree that justice was done because of what appears to be a fair trial based on lawyers who debated this available information. 
There are also people who believe, in spite of what the jury delivered, that this was a miscarriage of justice.
I ask you this, if all the facts and evidence were exactly the same ... identical, but instead of a Hispanic defendant, the defendant was white, or black, what would be happening right now in the media and general public?
I say there would be totally different reactions to each scenario. I guess this means that one form of racism or another is to be found everywhere, every day. The way activists of every stripe push their race agenda simply perpetuates the divide between races.
