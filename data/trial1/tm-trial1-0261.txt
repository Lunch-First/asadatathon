GEORGE Zimmerman said he killed Trayvon Martin in self-defense and got off scot-free.
Marissa Alexander fired her gun to scare off her allegedly menacing husband and she got 20 years behind bars. 
The case of Alexander, 31, of Jacksonville, Fla., has become Exhibit A for people who say Zimmerman's acquittal illustrates how the U.S. justice system places less value on the lives of black people.
"This African-American woman didn't hurt anyone and now she might not hug her children for 20 years," wrote Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.) after Alexander's conviction in May 2012.
In 2010, Alexander, a mother of three, fired what she said was a warning shot at her husband.
Alexander's attorney invoked the "Stand Your Ground" law, which gives the benefit of the doubt to a shooter who feels threatened.
