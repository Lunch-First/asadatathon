You report on the anger in America at the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin ("Protests as man is cleared of killing black teenager", The Herald, July 15).  
The problem is the verdict may well have been correct under Florida law, something that is shocking to us in this country. The difficulty is the "Stand your ground" laws in many states including Florida (tellingly known in one state as the "Make my day" law) confirm that if someone feels in danger they are entitled to use deadly force, with a low threshold to demonstrate this, and explicitly state there is no requirement for the force to be proportional. These laws have been pushed by gun manufacturers in an effort to encourage gun sales and the result is killers walk free.
There has been some suggestion federal authorities might attempt to try Mr Zimmerman on civil rights charges in the manner used to try racist murders in the south when they knew there was no prospect of conviction in state courts. There is also a chance Mr Martin's family will attempt to sue Mr Zimmerman for civil liability. Either case may in some way limit the danger of the precedent this verdict sets but it should be remembered that no verdict will bring back Trayvon Martin and the best that can be done is for Florida to reconsider its laws that effectively decriminalise murder in certain cases.
