<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anthony Weiner has come under intense fire from Jewish leaders for &shy;invoking Nazi Germany while criticizing the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Last year, more than 700,000 in New York were stopped - the overwhelming majority of them were young men of color. Ninety-seven percent of them did nothing wrong,&quot; Weiner told largely black congregants in Staten Island's First Central Baptist Church Sunday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;And the mayor stood up and said, 'Wait a minute, statistically this' and 'statistically that.' Well, you can have 100 percent statistical reduction in crime if you stop everybody. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;You could have 1938 Germany, because everyone has to show their papers.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State Sen. Simcha Felder, who represents largely &shy;Orthodox communities in South Brooklyn, slammed Weiner's remarks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;His comments were shocking and disgraceful . . . [and] he should apologize,&quot; Felder declared. &quot;Anyone who uses the Holocaust frivolously diminishes the tragedy that occurred. Weiner clearly stepped over the line.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Weiner made the comments a day after the controversial acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Weiner campaign yesterday sought to clarify the explosive comments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The context of the reference was the argument made by some that stopping innocent citizens was an &shy;acceptable cost for public safety,&quot; said Weiner spokeswoman Barbara Morgan. &quot;He clearly was not equating 1938 Nazi Germany to New York City.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The latest Quinnipiac University Democratic mayoral poll shows Weiner on top with 25 percent, followed by Christine Quinn with 22 percent. But Weiner pulls 20 percent of the Jewish vote, more than any other candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The controversial Nazi comment comes as the Democratic candidates jockey to appeal to voters critical of stop-and-frisk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As City Council speaker, Quinn championed a bill that creates an NYPD inspector general to monitor stop-and-frisk. </SPAN></P>
