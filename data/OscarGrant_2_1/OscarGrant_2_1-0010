<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's how many African-Americans were selected to sit on the Los Angeles County jury that will determine whether Johannes Mehserle is guilty of murder for shooting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III New Year's Day 2009 on the BART Fruitvale train platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are seven whites, four Hispanics and one East Indian. Eight women, four men. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How's this for an ironic twist?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alameda County Superior Court Judge Morris Jacobson ordered a change of venue in the racially charged case because he believed the former BART officer could not get a fair trial in the jurisdiction where the alleged crime occurred. The stupid protesters who vandalized downtown Oakland should give themselves a round of applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle's attorney, Michael Rains, asserted that African-Americans in Alameda County were too biased against the white former BART officer to be trusted to serve on a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made the preposterous suggestion that most of us blacks are so weak-minded, we would buckle under community pressure to convict   regardless of the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess the defense won't have to worry about that in Los Angeles. Rains used three of his peremptory challenges to remove the final three potential black jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, there have been loud protestations over the racial composition of the Mehserle jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant's family members and friends are outraged. They worry that a jury without blacks guarantees that Mehserle will walk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is, in this day and age, it's naive, and frankly racist, to assume that a person will think and act a certain way based solely on his or her race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race is part of who we are, but it is not the entirety of our being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no guarantee that black jurors would have been more inclined to convict Mehserle of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the &quot;Riders&quot; case, an African-American was foreman on a jury that voted to acquit the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are African-Americans   trust me   who'd probably be more inclined to give Mehserle a medal than to convict. Unless you're the defense, would you really want any of them seated on the jury just for the sake of having a black face present?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A half dozen of the jurors have law enforcement connections, either through family, friends or working with police. Yet does that mean they'll automatically side with Mehserle?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops can be some of the harshest critics of misconduct in other cops. They know that every instance of bad behavior reflects badly on the entire profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of those who protested Grant's killing were white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we to presume that because their skin doesn't have as much melanin as mine, they would vote to acquit due to &quot;white think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News flash!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a black president in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama would never have been elected if every white person in this country who voted cast their ballot for the white candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not 1955 Mississippi, where an all-white jury seeking to preserve the &quot;Southern way of life&quot; rushed to acquit two white men accused of kidnapping and brutally murdering 14-year-old Emmet Till.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is it 1992 Simi Valley, where an all-white jury impaneled from a bastion of white flight acquitted four police officers accused of beating Rodney King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The absence of blacks on the Mehserle jury is not part of a racist conspiracy to enable him to get away with murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's mostly a matter of demographics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of black Angelenos has been steadily dwindling. African-Americans now make up about 9 percent of the population. Asians are 13 percent, whites 28 percent and Hispanics 47 percent. Blacks are also more likely to have financial hardships that prevent them from serving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you've only got 12 African-Americans in the group of 100 potential jurors, is it that surprising when none make the final cut?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real problem is not that there are no blacks on the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm more concerned about how the absence of African-Americans will be perceived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will some assume that the process is rigged if Mehserle isn't convicted of first-degree murder by a jury without African-Americans? Will they use that as an excuse to create more mayhem?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I doubt that Alameda County prosecutors would have allowed white supremacists to sneak onto the panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, it's going to come down to what's in these people's hearts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can't tell that just from the color of a person's skin.</SPAN></P>
