<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT IF no one videotaped the police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if there had been no video that captured a BART police officer shooting the Hayward man in the back while he lay prone on the platform at the Fruitvale station in Oakland? No compelling images downloaded hundreds of thousands of times from Oakland to New Delhi?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would Johannes Mehserle, the former BART officer accused of killing Grant, have still been charged with murder? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we know is the videos have played a major role toward how the Grant case has unfolded   both in terms of public pressure and the response by the Alameda County district attorney. Former Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff said cell phone videos were a key factor in his decision to charge Mehserle with murder, rather than a lesser charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Videos will be crucial pieces of evidence as the Mehserle trial gets under way in Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle's attorney, Michael Rains, had filed a motion to prevent the videos from being shown to the jury. On Wednesday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Robert Perry dismissed it. Jurors will see what countless others have seen on the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are videos on YouTube and Facebook that show police officers behaving badly. One popular download depicted a nut case in a Washington, D.C., brandishing a gun to break up a snowball fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People have increasingly been turning to their cell phones to document what they believe are instances of police abuse and misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New York City police officer was convicted of perjury based in large part on a cell phone video taken by a tourist that showed the officer knocking a cyclist off his bicycle during a demonstration in 2008. The officer claimed the cyclist had attacked him first and charged the man with resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Videos by Joe Citizen, uploaded to Facebook and YouTube, have increasingly caught rogue officers red-handed. That should be considered a good thing. It doesn't serve any of our interests to have abusive lawbreaking cops on the loose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why in the world would states such as Massachusetts, Maryland and Illinois make it illegal to videotape on-duty police officers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legal justification stretches current wiretapping and surveillance laws to the point of ludicrousness. These three states are among 12 that have laws stating that all parties must consent to a recording for it to be legal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea is to prevent a reporter, say, from secretly taping someone without their knowledge during a telephone conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law was never intended to apply to public places where no one has a reasonable expectation of privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police are public employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why shouldn't the citizens who pay their salaries be allowed to photograph them, as long as the shooters aren't interfering with an arrest? Or, in certain rare exceptions, if the officer is undercover and exposing his identity would place him in peril?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why shouldn't officers expect to be accountable to the public?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police officers who are doing their jobs with integrity and respect for the law   which many are   have nothing to worry about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's outrageous that police have arrested people merely for videotaping officer's activities on public streets in Boston, Philadelphia, Miami and Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher Drew was charged with violating Illinois' eavesdropping statute for recording his encounter with police while he was selling T-shirts on the street. A Cook County judge threw out Drew's request to have the case dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He faces a felony   the same class of crime as a sexual assault   for illegally taping his own arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Audio and videotape have played a vital role in helping expose police abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rodney King, anyone?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As long as members of the public aren't obstructing or otherwise interfering with police officers, they should be well within their rights to videotape them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if it were illegal to videotape police in California?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would those who recorded the Grant shooting have been arrested and thrown in jail?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would their then-illegally obtained videos be inadmissible in court?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How would that scenario have served the best interest of justice?</SPAN></P>
