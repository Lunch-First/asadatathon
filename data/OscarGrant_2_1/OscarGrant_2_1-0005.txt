New BART Police Chief Kenton Rainey started on the job Wednesday, taking over a department under intense public scrutiny since a transit officer fatally shot an unarmed passenger on New Year's Day 2009. 
Rainey, 51, the former Fairfield police chief, was hired by BART General Manager Dorothy Dugger for the $186,000-a-year post. He oversees 206 sworn officers.
Dugger said the chief's goals include increasing police visibility on trains, providing better training and improving community relations.
"Chief Rainey embodies the change the community, the BART Board and the dedicated men and women who serve on the BART police force seek," Dugger said in a prepared statement announcing that Rainey had cleared background checks and started his new post.
In his 23 years with the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, Rainey, who is black, helped write that department's policies aimed at preventing biased policing and racial profiling.
BART police relations with minorities were strained 17 months ago when then-officer Johannes Mehserle shot to death 
 III at the Fruitvale BART station. Mehserle's murder trial began in Los Angeles County this week.
