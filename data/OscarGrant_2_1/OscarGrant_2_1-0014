<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES -- &quot;They're beating us up for no reason. Let me call you back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those were the last words Sophia Mesa heard from her boyfriend, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III, before he was fatally shot by a BART police officer Jan. 1, 2009, she testified Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa took the witness stand in the murder case against former BART police officer Johannes Mehserle to explain to the jury, among other things, that Grant had a fear of Tasers dating to an incident in 2006 when he was stunned by San Leandro police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy District Attorney David Stein called Mesa, 26, in the middle of the testimony of several passengers who witnessed Grant's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa remained calm throughout her testimony, pausing once to compose herself before explaining how she watched Grant get wheeled out of the Fruitvale BART station on a stretcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I kept calling and calling. He picked up my call, it was fast,&quot; Mesa said. &quot;He said, 'They're beating us up for no reason. Let me call you back.' Then he hung up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later she said, &quot;I heard a loud -- the gunshot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa said it was the last time she talked to Grant, the father of her now-6-year-old daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa described what she called a &quot;pushing&quot; match that began between Grant and another man on the train before it arrived at Fruitvale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was that confrontation, which various people have described as either a fight or an argument, that brought police to the station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa said it wasn't much of a fight, and said it was over by the time the train stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa did not explain why she left Grant on the train at the Fruitvale station, but the defense contends that she and Grant decided that he should remain on the train to avoid arrest. Grant was ordered to get off the train by BART police Officer Anthony Pirone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant was on probation and parole at the time. If he had been arrested, he could have been charged with violating his parole and sent back to prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury will not learn that Grant was on parole, but defense attorney Michael Rains seized on Mesa's testimony to highlight Grant's past arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a tense cross-examination, Rains peppered Mesa with questions about why Grant feared Tasers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did he tell you that it involved the San Leandro police?&quot; Rains asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; Mesa replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did he tell you that he was running from the police?&quot; Rains asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains continued to ask questions about the incident until he was interrupted by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The point is, (Grant) had a prior incident in which he was Tased,&quot; Perry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other BART passengers, all part of a group of friends, also testified about the incident in similar fashion, saying BART police acted aggressively toward Grant and his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They all also said the shooting was a complete surprise and, in their view, unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pamela Caneva said she remembers how she saw Mehserle standing over Grant while former BART police officer Anthony Pirone had his knee against Grant's neck. At that point, she said, she saw Mehserle reach for his right hip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said to my friend, 'He's not going to shoot him, is he?'&quot; she said. &quot;And then he shot him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witnesses said that Mehserle put his hands to his head after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
