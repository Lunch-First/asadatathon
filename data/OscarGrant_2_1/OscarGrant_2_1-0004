<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND   As part of preparations for a verdict in the murder trial of Johannes Mehserle, the former BART police officer accused of killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III, Oakland police today plan to hold a crowd-control training exercise for officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Command staff also will receive training on how to respond to different scenarios that might arise after a verdict, spokesman Officer Jeff Thomason said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exercise, which will involve dozens of officers in specialized units such as Crime Reduction Teams, Problem Solving Officers and Targeted Enforcement Task Force, will be held on Port of Oakland property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers in other units will get the same refresher training later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are gearing up for the verdict of the Los Angeles jury hearing the murder case against Mehserle, who is on trial for fatally shooting Grant on Jan. 1, 2009, at Oakland's Fruitvale BART station. Testimony is still going on, and it is believed the jury will not begin deliberations until the end of the month at the earliest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides the training exercise, Oakland police officials have been meeting periodically with other law enforcement agencies in the area to discuss contingency plans for anything that might happen after a verdict is rendered, especially if mutual aid is needed. Those agencies include the Alameda County Sheriff's Office, California Highway Patrol and BART police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police will be out to prevent the rioting and vandalism that happened in January 2009 after Grant was killed and when Mehserle was released on $3 million bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomason assured that police have a plan to prevent violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not something we just started thinking about,&quot; he said. &quot;It has been in the works for some time. We're hoping for nonviolence no matter what the verdict. We will be prepared for any contingency and we will, with other agencies, have enough officers on the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
