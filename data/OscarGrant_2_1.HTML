</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c5">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Wilson Riles Guest Commentary</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c5">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c5">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">536 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN AN article in this newspaper about the Johannes Mehserle trial jury selection, Laurie Levenson, a professor of law at Loyola, is quoted as having said that &quot;in this day and age ... it is a little bit racist, to say you have to be black to have empathy for blacks.&quot; Tammerlin Drummond essentially repeated this charge of racism in her column on the subject: &quot;it's naive, and frankly racist.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I cry out loud: No, no, you don't get it!?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malcolm X discovered what Professor Levenson and columnist Drummond miss when he was directed in prison to look up the meaning of the word &quot;white&quot; and the word &quot;black&quot; in the English dictionary. Malcolm found that the meaning for &quot;white&quot; leans toward goodness and innocence, while the meaning of &quot;black&quot; leans toward evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This linguistics color-bias is replicated on many cultural and socio-psychological levels here in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who consciously or unconsciously claim white privilege rarely are able to overcome these cultural tides of negativity to fairly judge the life-worth of an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make no mistake, Michael Rains, Mehserle's attorney, will be sailing with the tide when he denigrates Grant's character. Caucasians who are blind to their privilege and those who seek to go along and not cause any problems will be carried consciously and unconsciously toward biased decisions. This is the reality of racism today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know that blacks suffer from the negative social-psychological pressure of a deep-seeded prejudice that has shaped almost every aspect of U.S. society, especially the criminal justice system. We know this constant pressure causes blacks to suffer from internalized racism, low self-esteem, poor health and much relational dysfunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's be real; it also skews the feelings and perceptions of whites. I suggest that Levenson and Drummond   and any who agree with them   read two very recent exposures of this phenomenon: &quot;The History of White People&quot; by Nell Irvin Painter and &quot;The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in an Era of Colorblindness&quot; by Michelle Alexander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's not fool ourselves. President Barack Obama's election contributes only an incremental metric to this country's struggle with racism. Did Lionel Wilson's election as mayor make much impact on institutional and cultural racism in Oakland? No!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In general, the best that targets of racism can hope for is sympathy, not empathy. The founder of analytical psychology, C.G. Jung, described the use and the power of the &quot;shadow side.&quot; Do we really   in this day and age   need an explanation about how European-Western-Anglo Saxon culture demonizes and denigrates people of color?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;shadow side&quot; is deeply buried in hearts and minds, language, institutions and judgments despite feelings of sympathy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Jung, the shadow overwhelms a person's actions; for example, when the conscious mind is shocked, confused or paralyzed by indecision. The Mehserle trial has historical implications because a police officer has never been charged with murder for actions taken on-duty. Rains is very skilled at shocking, confusing and paralyzing jurors' minds. We will not get to justice by papering over or denying reality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c5">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Paul T. Rosynsky Oakland Tribune</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c5">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BREAKING; My Town; Alameda; News; Local</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c5">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">759 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES   Former BART police officer Marysol Domenici, the second officer to arrive at the scene where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III eventually was killed, began her testimony Thursday, giving the jury its first glimpse of how a prosecutor intends to attack the credibility of the officers who witnessed one of their own kill an unarmed man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy district attorney David Stein wasted no time in attacking Domenici's testimony, immediately pointing out that statements she gave in previous hearings and interviews did not match what was depicted in recorded scenes of the events that led to the 22-year-old Hayward man's death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By his third or fourth question, Stein suggested Domenici, who was fired from the BART police force this year, exaggerated her description of the chaos in Oakland on the Fruitvale BART platform in hopes of justifying the killing that resulted in the murder charge against fellow officer Johannes Mehserle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you exaggerate the conduct of those on the platform in an attempt to justify the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Stein asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; Domenici replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stein initially focused on Domenici's description of what she saw when she was called to the platform early Jan. 1, 2009. The officer said that she immediately was confronted on the platform by 50 people who were coming off a Dublin-bound BART train and that she &quot;felt threatened&quot; by their presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw people on the train and people on the platform,&quot; she said. &quot;I remember people on the train calling me lady cop, and they were singing the lady cop song as I ran by.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stein then showed a videotape recorded by a platform security camera that showed Domenici running down an empty platform with no passengers exiting the train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the 50 people she saw, Domenici said they could not be seen on the video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout his questioning, as Stein showed videos from different angles, he repeatedly asked Domenici to point out the 50 people she had just described as being on the platform threatening her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She never could, and at one point she said, &quot;When I said the platform, to me the train is an extension of the platform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Domenici's testimony immediately brought tension to a courtroom that earlier in the week had been relatively calm as experts testified about the training police officers receive and how they are supposed to react to certain situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each time she was questioned, Domenici gave rambling answers justifying her reactions, sparking several requests by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry for her to limit her answers to the question asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen carefully to his questions,&quot; Perry said at one point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Try to focus on the questions that are asked,&quot; the judge said later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stein painstakingly guided Domenici through the actions she took once she arrived on the platform, comparing what she said on the witness stand with what can be seen in videos of the events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, Domenici admitted that Grant and his friends complied with her various orders and &quot;calmed down&quot; once her partner, Anthony Pirone, took out his Taser and pointed it at the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They never struggled with me,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stein also used Domenici to attack a defense contention that Grant, at one point, put his hands on Domenici's forearm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Domenici said she does not remember that Grant ever touched her but said she was told by her attorney that a video shows he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When shown the video, Domenici said she could not clearly see Grant touching her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't remember Grant grabbing my arm,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Domenici said she remembered the platform where Grant was killed being loud as passengers called her disparaging names and Grant and his friends saying, &quot;That's (expletive) up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She admitted that Pirone never told her to search Grant and his friends when he asked her to watch them as he went to the train to get another passenger. She also said she never searched Grant and his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Domenici said she did not see Mehserle fire the shot that killed Grant, she remembered hearing a loud noise she described as a &quot;firework.&quot; She said she immediately knew someone had been shot but did not know who.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, she said, she never took out her gun because she knew quickly that another officer had not been shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My first reaction was to look at the officers' faces because I didn't know who got shot,&quot; she said. &quot;I just heard people saying, 'He got shot; he got shot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if that prompted her to take out her gun for safety, Domenici said it did not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody had their guns out, none of the other officers,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Domenici will continue testifying today, followed by Pirone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND   As part of preparations for a verdict in the murder trial of Johannes Mehserle, the former BART police officer accused of killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III, Oakland police today plan to hold a crowd-control training exercise for officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Command staff also will receive training on how to respond to different scenarios that might arise after a verdict, spokesman Officer Jeff Thomason said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exercise, which will involve dozens of officers in specialized units such as Crime Reduction Teams, Problem Solving Officers and Targeted Enforcement Task Force, will be held on Port of Oakland property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers in other units will get the same refresher training later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are gearing up for the verdict of the Los Angeles jury hearing the murder case against Mehserle, who is on trial for fatally shooting Grant on Jan. 1, 2009, at Oakland's Fruitvale BART station. Testimony is still going on, and it is believed the jury will not begin deliberations until the end of the month at the earliest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides the training exercise, Oakland police officials have been meeting periodically with other law enforcement agencies in the area to discuss contingency plans for anything that might happen after a verdict is rendered, especially if mutual aid is needed. Those agencies include the Alameda County Sheriff's Office, California Highway Patrol and BART police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police will be out to prevent the rioting and vandalism that happened in January 2009 after Grant was killed and when Mehserle was released on $3 million bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomason assured that police have a plan to prevent violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not something we just started thinking about,&quot; he said. &quot;It has been in the works for some time. We're hoping for nonviolence no matter what the verdict. We will be prepared for any contingency and we will, with other agencies, have enough officers on the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rainey, 51, the former Fairfield police chief, was hired by BART General Manager Dorothy Dugger for the $186,000-a-year post. He oversees 206 sworn officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dugger said the chief's goals include increasing police visibility on trains, providing better training and improving community relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chief Rainey embodies the change the community, the BART Board and the dedicated men and women who serve on the BART police force seek,&quot; Dugger said in a prepared statement announcing that Rainey had cleared background checks and started his new post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his 23 years with the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, Rainey, who is black, helped write that department's policies aimed at preventing biased policing and racial profiling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES   Police officer training was the focal point Tuesday in the murder trial against former BART police Officer Johannes Mehserle as a handful of BART and independent experts testified about how police officers are supposed to conduct themselves in various situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the testimony was void of any emotion, it was filled with poignant facts that the prosecution and defense attempted to use to prove that Mehserle either intentionally pulled out his gun and fatally shot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III in the back or tragically mistook his gun for his Taser early Jan. 1, 2009. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Michael Rains focused on testimony from two firearms trainers   one from BART and the other from Napa Valley College   to show that Mehserle's actions in the seconds it took him to draw and shoot his gun were not consistent with the actions a well-trained officer would follow if that officer intended to use his firearm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, deputy district attorney David Stein used the two firearms experts and a BART police use-of-force trainer to show that none of the BART officers responding to the Fruitvale station in Oakland the morning Grant was killed followed the training they were given by the BART Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stein focused on the gun Mehserle used in the killing and the holster he used to carry it to show that an officer must follow a unique set of steps in order to pull the gun from a holster and then fire it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout his questioning of the experts, Stein had each repeat a cardinal rule given to all police officers: &quot;Do not point a firearm at anything you don't want to destroy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both firearms training experts   David Clark, an instructor at Napa Valley College where Mehserle was a police cadet, and Sgt. Paul Garcia, a trainer at BART who gave Mehserle lessons   said learning to pull a gun from a holster and preparing to fire was the most important aspect of a police officer's training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both said they continually preach practice to future and current officers and hope that once an officer makes a decision to use lethal force, the act of pulling a gun becomes second-nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have to be practiced over and over and over again,&quot; Clark said of the motions used to unholster a gun and fire it. &quot;It takes a long time to build up muscle memory, to be able to draw a weapon smoothly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle had been a police officer for less than two years when he killed Grant, a 22-year-old Hayward resident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stein also focused on the use-of-force training to highlight the proper techniques   dubbed the Koga techniques   that are supposed to be used to search and arrest a suspect. Videos recorded of the BART police officers' actions the morning Grant was killed show that most officers on the platform did not follow those rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains used the experts to highlight the lack of training BART officers had in using Tasers and to point out that videos of the shooting show that Mehserle was not following the techniques an officer is trained to follow once he decides to use lethal force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains had Clark view a video of the shooting and comment on the technique Mehserle used before killing Grant. The video shows that Mehserle stood up, fumbled with his holster and then fired a shot at Grant, who was lying on a concrete station platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are things that are not consistent (with what a properly trained officer would do),&quot; Clark said as he observed Mehserle pulling out his gun and firing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Mehserle's actions of standing up before shooting, struggling with his holster and then immediately putting his gun back into his holster after the shot, Clark and Garcia said Mehserle's actions defied another cardinal rule taught to police officers: Do not use lethal force, even if deemed necessary, if the firing of a gun could result in others' being injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firing a bullet into a suspect's back while that suspect lies on concrete with other officers and suspects nearby would be an example of when not to use lethal force, both experts agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the exact example I often use,&quot; Garcia said as he described how he trains BART officers to be cautious of using their guns on crowded station platforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains also used the experts to point out that BART failed to properly train its officers on the use of Tasers and showed that the officers, including Mehserle, were supplied Tasers less than a month before Grant was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garcia said he asked BART police officials, including retired Chief Gary Gee, to conduct training for officers in the use of Tasers under stressful conditions, but that training was denied for what appeared to be monetary reasons. Therefore, Garcia said, BART officers were never trained how to use Tasers in stressful situations or react to situations in which an officer would have to make a decision whether to use a Taser or a gun on a suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stein, however, asked if it is possible that an officer's emotions could take over and result in an officer neglecting his training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Clark said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lack of control (could result). They are not used to dealing with it,&quot; Clark said of stressful situations. &quot;If an officer is not used to handling the situation, it could affect them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following up on Rains' questions about whether Mehserle's actions in drawing his gun were inconsistent with training, Stein asked Garcia if it was inconsistent with training for an officer to fire a fatal bullet into the back of an unarmed man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That would be inconsistent with our training,&quot; Garcia said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES   Carlos Reyes was just two feet away from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III when former BART police officer Johannes Mehserle pointed his gun at Grant's back and fired the bullet that killed the Hayward man, Reyes testified Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shot was fired, Reyes said, about a second after he was yelling at police to remove Grant from on top of his legs, where the 22-year-old had been pushed down by two BART police officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was telling them, 'Get him off my legs,' &quot; Reyes said as he tried to hold back tears. &quot;I looked away for a second and then I heard a gunshot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reyes said he looked back at Grant and then at Mehserle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember, I remember Officer Mehserle saying, 'Oh, (expletive), Oh, God, I shot him,'&quot; Reyes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reyes said the gunshot came after he and his friends were cursed at and manhandled by former BART police officer Anthony Pirone, who Reyes said kneed one of his friends in the stomach and continually used a profanity to order the group around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reyes said he saw Grant's face after the shot and heard his friend of 10 years tell Mehserle that the officer shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He looked back and he said, 'You shot me. You shot me,' &quot; Reyes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, Reyes said, he watched as Grant's eyes opened and shut and blood began to trickle from his mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I could see Oscar laying facedown and he was closing his eyes,&quot; Reyes said. &quot;We were telling him to stay awake; you could see blood coming out of his mouth a little bit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reyes was the second close friend of Grant who testified Monday about the shooting, BART officer's aggressive actions toward the group and a confrontation Grant was involved in on a Dublin-bound train which sparked the police response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, Grant's girlfriend, Sophina Mesa, testified about the last conversation she had with Grant before he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa said she left the BART train when it pulled into the Fruitvale station because she planned to stay at a friend's house, located about a mile from the station. As she left the train, she said, Grant stayed aboard and she tried to call his cell phone. Grant was later ordered off the train by Pirone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took several tries before Grant answered and spoke his last words to her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I kept calling and calling. He picked up my call, it was fast,&quot; Mesa said. &quot;He said, 'They're beating us up for no reason, let me call you back.' Then he hung up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, Mesa said with a pause, &quot;I heard a loud   the gunshot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa was called to the witness stand by Deputy District Attorney David Stein to testify about her relationship with Grant, how they had a daughter together and how Grant had a fear of Tasers sparked by an incident in 2006 when he was Tased by a San Leandro police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa said Grant had told her on numerous occasions that he feared the Taser and would not wish its use on anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said he wouldn't wish it and he wouldn't want it to happen to him again,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle's defense attorney, Michael Rains, attempted to use Mesa's testimony to highlight's Grant's criminal past and conducted a combative exchange with the 26-year-old about how she learned that Grant had been Tased in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That exchange was cut short by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry, who said, &quot;The point is, (Grant) had a prior incident in which he was Tased.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains also used the testimony of Mesa and Reyes to highlight the differences in the version of events they described Monday and the versions they explained at various times after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains appeared to focus on the confrontation Grant had with another BART passenger on the train which resulted in the train operator calling for assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both witnesses refused to describe the confrontation as a fight, although they had dubbed it a fight in other statements either given to BART police detectives or to an investigator for Oakland attorney John Burris, who is representing Grant's family in a wrongful-death lawsuit against the transit organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stein had Reyes describe how he was beaten after the shooting by a BART officer, handcuffed and then held for hours afterward before he was questioned by BART detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reyes said he lied to the police during questioning on New Year's Day because he feared the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just saw them shoot someone close to me for no reason; I didn't know what they were going to do,&quot; Reyes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle is charged with murder in the killing of Grant. Rains has said that the shooting was a mistake caused by Mehserle mistaking his gun for his Taser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Reyes and Mesa, several passengers who saw the shooting testified about how they believed BART police abused their power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All said they did not see Grant and his friends resist arrest nor did they see Grant and his friends try to fight with the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, they said Mehserle had a look of shock on his face after the shooting and immediately put his hands to his head after the shot was fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, they said, after Grant was shot, the officers seemed to be more concerned about each other than Grant, who was laying face down on the platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one was checking the guy on the ground,&quot; said Lydia Kiersted, a passenger who saw the events that led to the shooting and the aftermath.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES   Carlos Reyes was just two feet away from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III when former BART police officer Johannes Mehserle pointed his gun at Grant's back and fired the bullet that killed the Hayward man, Reyes testified Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shot was fired, Reyes said, about a second after he was yelling at police to remove Grant from on top of his legs, where the 22-year-old had been pushed down by two BART police officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was telling them, 'Get him off my legs,'&quot; Reyes said as he tried to hold back tears. &quot;I looked away for a second and then I heard a gunshot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reyes said he looked back at Grant and then at Mehserle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember, I remember Officer Mehserle saying, 'Oh, (expletive), Oh, God, I shot him,'&quot; Reyes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reyes said the gunshot came after he and his friends were cursed at and manhandled by former BART police officer Anthony Pirone, who Reyes said kneed one of his friends in the stomach and continually used a profanity to order the group around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reyes said he saw Grant's face after the shot and heard his friend of 10 years tell Mehserle that the officer shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He looked back and he said, 'You shot me. You shot me,'&quot; Reyes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, Reyes said, he watched as Grant's eyes opened and shut and blood began to trickle from his mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I could see Oscar laying facedown and he was closing his eyes,&quot; Reyes said. &quot;We were telling him to stay awake; you could see blood coming out of his mouth a little bit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reyes was the second close friend of Grant who testified Monday about the shooting, BART officer's aggressive actions toward the group and a confrontation Grant was involved in on a Dublin-bound train which sparked the police response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, Grant's girlfriend, Sophina Mesa, testified about the last conversation she had with Grant before he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa said she left the BART train when it pulled into the Fruitvale station because she planned to stay at a friend's house, located about a mile from the station. As she left the train, she said, Grant stayed aboard and she tried to call his cell phone. Grant was later ordered off the train by Pirone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took several tries before Grant answered and spoke his last words to her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I kept calling and calling. He picked up my call, it was fast,&quot; Mesa said. &quot;He said, 'They're beating us up for no reason, let me call you back.' Then he hung up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, Mesa said with a pause, &quot;I heard a loud   the gunshot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa was called to the witness stand by Deputy District Attorney David Stein to testify about her relationship with Grant, how they had a daughter together and how Grant had a fear of Tasers sparked by an incident in 2006 when he was Tased by a San Leandro police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa said Grant had told her on numerous occasions that he feared the Taser and would not wish its use on anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said he wouldn't wish it and he wouldn't want it to happen to him again,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle's defense attorney, Michael Rains, attempted to use Mesa's testimony to highlight's Grant's criminal past and conducted a combative exchange with the 26-year-old about how she learned that Grant had been Tased in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That exchange was cut short by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry, who said, &quot;The point is, (Grant) had a prior incident in which he was Tased.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains also used the testimony of Mesa and Reyes to highlight the differences in the version of events they described Monday and the versions they explained at various times after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains appeared to focus on the confrontation Grant had with another BART passenger on the train which resulted in the train operator calling for assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both witnesses refused to describe the confrontation as a fight, although they had dubbed it a fight in other statements either given to BART police detectives or to an investigator for Oakland attorney John Burris, who is representing Grant's family in a wrongful-death lawsuit against the transit organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stein had Reyes describe how he was beaten after the shooting by a BART officer, handcuffed and then held for hours afterward before he was questioned by BART detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reyes said he lied to the police during questioning on New Year's Day because he feared the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just saw them shoot someone close to me for no reason; I didn't know what they were going to do,&quot; Reyes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle is charged with murder in the killing of Grant. Rains has said that the shooting was a mistake caused by Mehserle mistaking his gun for his Taser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Reyes and Mesa, several passengers who saw the shooting testified about how they believed BART police abused their power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All said they did not see Grant and his friends resist arrest nor did they see Grant and his friends try to fight with the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, they said Mehserle had a look of shock on his face after the shooting and immediately put his hands to his head after the shot was fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, they said, after Grant was shot, the officers seemed to be more concerned about each other than Grant, who was laying face down on the platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one was checking the guy on the ground,&quot; said Lydia Kiersted, a passenger who saw the events that led to the shooting and the aftermath.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT IF no one videotaped the police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if there had been no video that captured a BART police officer shooting the Hayward man in the back while he lay prone on the platform at the Fruitvale station in Oakland? No compelling images downloaded hundreds of thousands of times from Oakland to New Delhi?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would Johannes Mehserle, the former BART officer accused of killing Grant, have still been charged with murder? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we know is the videos have played a major role toward how the Grant case has unfolded   both in terms of public pressure and the response by the Alameda County district attorney. Former Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff said cell phone videos were a key factor in his decision to charge Mehserle with murder, rather than a lesser charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Videos will be crucial pieces of evidence as the Mehserle trial gets under way in Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle's attorney, Michael Rains, had filed a motion to prevent the videos from being shown to the jury. On Wednesday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Robert Perry dismissed it. Jurors will see what countless others have seen on the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are videos on YouTube and Facebook that show police officers behaving badly. One popular download depicted a nut case in a Washington, D.C., brandishing a gun to break up a snowball fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People have increasingly been turning to their cell phones to document what they believe are instances of police abuse and misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New York City police officer was convicted of perjury based in large part on a cell phone video taken by a tourist that showed the officer knocking a cyclist off his bicycle during a demonstration in 2008. The officer claimed the cyclist had attacked him first and charged the man with resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Videos by Joe Citizen, uploaded to Facebook and YouTube, have increasingly caught rogue officers red-handed. That should be considered a good thing. It doesn't serve any of our interests to have abusive lawbreaking cops on the loose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why in the world would states such as Massachusetts, Maryland and Illinois make it illegal to videotape on-duty police officers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legal justification stretches current wiretapping and surveillance laws to the point of ludicrousness. These three states are among 12 that have laws stating that all parties must consent to a recording for it to be legal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea is to prevent a reporter, say, from secretly taping someone without their knowledge during a telephone conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law was never intended to apply to public places where no one has a reasonable expectation of privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police are public employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why shouldn't the citizens who pay their salaries be allowed to photograph them, as long as the shooters aren't interfering with an arrest? Or, in certain rare exceptions, if the officer is undercover and exposing his identity would place him in peril?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why shouldn't officers expect to be accountable to the public?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police officers who are doing their jobs with integrity and respect for the law   which many are   have nothing to worry about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's outrageous that police have arrested people merely for videotaping officer's activities on public streets in Boston, Philadelphia, Miami and Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher Drew was charged with violating Illinois' eavesdropping statute for recording his encounter with police while he was selling T-shirts on the street. A Cook County judge threw out Drew's request to have the case dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He faces a felony   the same class of crime as a sexual assault   for illegally taping his own arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Audio and videotape have played a vital role in helping expose police abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rodney King, anyone?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As long as members of the public aren't obstructing or otherwise interfering with police officers, they should be well within their rights to videotape them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if it were illegal to videotape police in California?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would those who recorded the Grant shooting have been arrested and thrown in jail?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would their then-illegally obtained videos be inadmissible in court?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How would that scenario have served the best interest of justice?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZERO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's how many African-Americans were selected to sit on the Los Angeles County jury that will determine whether Johannes Mehserle is guilty of murder for shooting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III New Year's Day 2009 on the BART Fruitvale train platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are seven whites, four Hispanics and one East Indian. Eight women, four men. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How's this for an ironic twist?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alameda County Superior Court Judge Morris Jacobson ordered a change of venue in the racially charged case because he believed the former BART officer could not get a fair trial in the jurisdiction where the alleged crime occurred. The stupid protesters who vandalized downtown Oakland should give themselves a round of applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle's attorney, Michael Rains, asserted that African-Americans in Alameda County were too biased against the white former BART officer to be trusted to serve on a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made the preposterous suggestion that most of us blacks are so weak-minded, we would buckle under community pressure to convict   regardless of the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess the defense won't have to worry about that in Los Angeles. Rains used three of his peremptory challenges to remove the final three potential black jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, there have been loud protestations over the racial composition of the Mehserle jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant's family members and friends are outraged. They worry that a jury without blacks guarantees that Mehserle will walk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is, in this day and age, it's naive, and frankly racist, to assume that a person will think and act a certain way based solely on his or her race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race is part of who we are, but it is not the entirety of our being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no guarantee that black jurors would have been more inclined to convict Mehserle of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the &quot;Riders&quot; case, an African-American was foreman on a jury that voted to acquit the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are African-Americans   trust me   who'd probably be more inclined to give Mehserle a medal than to convict. Unless you're the defense, would you really want any of them seated on the jury just for the sake of having a black face present?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A half dozen of the jurors have law enforcement connections, either through family, friends or working with police. Yet does that mean they'll automatically side with Mehserle?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops can be some of the harshest critics of misconduct in other cops. They know that every instance of bad behavior reflects badly on the entire profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of those who protested Grant's killing were white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we to presume that because their skin doesn't have as much melanin as mine, they would vote to acquit due to &quot;white think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News flash!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a black president in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama would never have been elected if every white person in this country who voted cast their ballot for the white candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not 1955 Mississippi, where an all-white jury seeking to preserve the &quot;Southern way of life&quot; rushed to acquit two white men accused of kidnapping and brutally murdering 14-year-old Emmet Till.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is it 1992 Simi Valley, where an all-white jury impaneled from a bastion of white flight acquitted four police officers accused of beating Rodney King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The absence of blacks on the Mehserle jury is not part of a racist conspiracy to enable him to get away with murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's mostly a matter of demographics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of black Angelenos has been steadily dwindling. African-Americans now make up about 9 percent of the population. Asians are 13 percent, whites 28 percent and Hispanics 47 percent. Blacks are also more likely to have financial hardships that prevent them from serving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you've only got 12 African-Americans in the group of 100 potential jurors, is it that surprising when none make the final cut?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real problem is not that there are no blacks on the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm more concerned about how the absence of African-Americans will be perceived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will some assume that the process is rigged if Mehserle isn't convicted of first-degree murder by a jury without African-Americans? Will they use that as an excuse to create more mayhem?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I doubt that Alameda County prosecutors would have allowed white supremacists to sneak onto the panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, it's going to come down to what's in these people's hearts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can't tell that just from the color of a person's skin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES   The first full day of testimony in the murder case against former BART police Officer Johannes Mehserle provided the courtroom Friday with the trial's first emotional outburst from the witness stand. A 17-year-old friend of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III broke down in tears as he watched a video he recorded capturing the sound of Mehserle's gun firing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uncontrollable sobs of Jamil Dewar, which came minutes before an afternoon lunch break at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center,  were just a quick moment in a day that also revealed how Mehserle's defense attorney intends to bring into question Grant's behavior in the minutes before he was killed by Mehserle as he lay face down on the Fruitvale BART station platform in Oakland early Jan. 1, 2009. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day's testimony from five witnesses also revealed how deputy district attorney David Stein will attempt to use observations from witnesses of the killing to rebut an anticipated defense video analysis that the defense contends proves that Grant, a 22-year-old Hayward man, and his friends resisted arrest and acted violently toward BART police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dewar's tears, which forced an early lunch break, came after the jury had heard from three other BART passengers who captured videos of the shooting and the events that led up to it on their digital cameras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dewar was calm and composed as he began his testimony, describing to Stein how there was a &quot;tussle&quot; on the train between Grant and another man known to Grant and his friends as the Dublin-Pleasanton-bound train pulled into the Fruitvale station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After about 10 minutes of questioning, Stein played the video Dewar recorded of the events leading to Grant's killing. As the sound of Mehserle's gun firing was heard through the speakers of two flat-screen televisions, Dewar burst into uncontrollable sobs and put his head down between his hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stein asked for an immediate break as Dewar's mother, also crying, rushed to the witness stand to comfort her son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dewar's sobs turned into visible disgust after lunch when Mehserle's defense attorney, Michael Rains, sought details from the teen about the fight Grant was involved in on the train and suggested the emotional outburst was just a stunt to influence the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains pointed out that Dewar had not reacted the same way last year during a preliminary hearing in the case when the video was shown in a larger Alameda County courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was more fresh in my mind then,&quot; Dewar said. &quot;I haven't watched that same video since then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, so when it was fresh in your mind, you didn't feel the same emotional response you did today?&quot; Rains asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; Dewar responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, OK,&quot; Rains said, sarcastically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains used his questioning of Dewar to point out that Grant was involved in a fight on the BART train and to show that Dewar gave more details of that confrontation to a private investigator working for Oakland attorney John Burris, who represents Grant's family in a multimillion-dollar wrongful death lawsuit against BART.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The style of questioning was much more confrontational compared with how Rains questioned other witnesses who also captured the events that led to Grant's death on their digital cameras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testimony from those other witnesses appeared to give Stein and Rains information to bolster the arguments that they said, during opening statements, they will make throughout the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Stein, the witnesses provided contradictions to the defense argument that Grant and his friends were acting aggressively toward BART police and at times attempted to strike the officers with their fists. All but one witness called Friday said they did not see Grant and his friends resist arrest or try to strike the officers as the group was told to stand along a wall at the station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one witness who said it appeared Grant and his friends were not being completely cooperative said only that the group refused to sit down when told to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witnesses said they began to record the events on video because they thought BART police,   and in particular former Officer Anthony Pirone   were abusing their power. The abuse began, they said, as soon as Pirone arrived at the station and began cursing at Grant and his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the group was forced, by Pirone, against a wall at the station, at least two witnesses said it appeared to them that Grant was the person trying to calm the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, two witnesses said, Grant placed his arm against his friend as the friend was yelling at a female officer in front of him. A second later, Pirone ran up and, it appears in the video, hits Grant in the head and forces him to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains contends that Grant was trying to punch the officer, but the witnesses viewed the event differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What it looked like to me is that his friend had gotten smart with the female officer, and (Grant) was saying, 'Calm down, don't get smart,' &quot; said Karina Vargas, whose video of the event has been featured prominently in the case. &quot;They looked like they were doing everything the officers wanted them to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tommy Cross, who also captured the shooting with a video recorded from his digital camera, remembered it the same way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It didn't look to me like he reached for her; it looked like he was reaching to his friend,&quot; Cross said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, however, the witnesses described Mehserle as being &quot;shocked,&quot; &quot;dumbfounded&quot; and &quot;surprised&quot; after he pulled the trigger on his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Cross said he remembered, at it is shown in the video he recorded, that after the shooting, Mehserle knelt down and handcuffed Grant as he lay dying on the station platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked how the police responded after the shooting, Cross said, &quot;Not the way they should have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They began to restrain him,&quot; Cross continued as he described being in shock over what he had just seen. &quot;I just witnessed an individual being shot by someone who is supposed to calm things down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 20 years after the trial in the beating of Rodney King, eyes across the US are once again fixed on a Los Angeles courtroom for a trial involving police misconduct - this time with rare murder charges for an on-duty police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening statements began Thursday in the trial of former Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) officer Johannes Mehserle for the New Year's Day 2009 killing of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on an Oakland, Calif. train platform. Legal analysts say the trial's outcome will provide insight into the latest legal thinking on the issues of video evidence and juries' attitudes toward police brutality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You bet this is on the national radar,&quot; says former Maryland police officer Dr. Tod Burke, now a professor of criminal justice at Radford University in Virginia. &quot;Police departments and communities across the country will be watching this carefully for the clues it gives about many of the top issues in law enforcement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Grant was among a group of men who were detained after a fight on a BART train. Fellow passengers recorded the shooting and its aftermath on cellphones, and the video was viewed widely on TV and the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video shows Grant lying face down, being restrained by officers, when Mr. Mehserle shoots him once in the back. Mehserle's defense attorney has said that the officer meant to shoot Grant with an electronic stun gun, but mistakenly grabbed his pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Burke says the country is wondering how far it has come since the case of Los Angeles motorist Rodney King in 1991, who became known worldwide when the video of police beating him was played globally. After the acquittal of the police officers that followed, the most expensive riots in US history engulfed Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts say they will be watching this trial and what it says about how juries approach police brutality cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Juries tend to be sympathetic to police officers acting in the line of duty, and it will be interesting to see if that trend continues in this case,&quot; says Professor Kenneth Williams of Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles. He says that just last month a jury in Houston acquitted a police officer who shot an unarmed suspect under similar circumstances. &quot;Most legal analysts will be looking to see if that trend continues,&quot; says Mr. Williams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, Williams is keen to see whether the jury will believe the officer made a mistake, and if so, if it will convict him of murder or a lesser crime - or any at all. &quot;It should be interesting to see if the jury will actually convict the police officer of murder or will they convict him of a lesser crime, such as manslaughter?&quot; he asks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ubiquity of cellphones benefits this case, Burke says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We saw Rodney King getting beaten, but we don't know if he said anything to ease or provoke the police,&quot; he says. &quot;The BART incident videos could produce many lessons for both communities and police departments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How the judge keeps this trial under control is another issue that many will be watching. The trial has already been moved from Alameda County, near San Francisco, to Los Angeles to escape Bay-area publicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The judge is this case is serious about keeping the courtroom under control - he doesn't want this case to turn into the new trial of the century,&quot; says Jessica Levinson, adjunct professor of law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. Already, she says, &quot;he has imposed gag orders and banned the use of cell phones and communication devices in the courtroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has a lot riding on it, including the reputation and goodwill built up by law enforcement, says Rande Matteson, who teaches criminal justice at Saint Leo University in San Antonio. Often the public sees an event like the killing of Grant and loses trust in the law enforcement community, he says.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES   Chaos, distrust and disorder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the theme a prosecutor used Thursday to describe the events that led to the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III at the hands of a BART police officer Jan. 1, 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police aggression and emotions caused the chaos, distrust and disorder that led former BART police Officer Johannes Mehserle to purposely pull out his gun, point it at Grant's back and fatally shoot the 22-year-old Hayward man, deputy district attorney David Stein said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the result of emotions taking over. It was the result of aggression taking over for training and discipline,&quot; Stein said during a 95-minute opening statement. &quot;Was the defendant confused? Look at where he is looking. He is looking at what he is doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stein then showed one of six videos that recorded Grant's death and paused it at the second Mehserle looks down to his right hip and begins to pull out his gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stein focused on the videos captured by cameras and cell phones of passengers on the train. He also showed the jury new videos created by the Alameda County District Attorney's Office that demonstrate the differences between what Mehserle had to do to remove his gun from its holster and what he would have needed to do to access his Taser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It only comes out when you want it to come out,&quot; Stein said, explaining the various snaps and buttons an officer must push to remove a gun from a holster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Taser holster, Stein said as he held it before the jury, &quot;doesn't have the same retention device.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stein also pointed out that Mehserle wore his Taser and gun on opposite sides of his body and showed the jury that the gun is black and heavier than the Taser, which is yellow and lighter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stein began his opening statement in front of the packed courtroom of Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry. About 45 people watched, including media members from the Bay Area and Los Angeles. Also in the galley were Grant's family members, including his mother, Wanda Johnson, and Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley, who inherited the controversial murder case when longtime District Attorney Tom Orloff retired last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through much of his opening statements, Stein focused on the actions of former BART Officer Anthony Pirone, who appears in almost all the videos to incite the crowd on the BART train and Grant and his friends through physical and verbal abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stein called it an example of out-of-control police officers who acted out of aggression instead of according to their training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What happens when an officer or a group of officers believe that their duty is to more than just protect and serve?&quot; Stein asked, using a motto he said was created by the Los Angeles Police Department. &quot;What happens when they believe they should punish? &quot;... The result will always be chaos, distrust and disorder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That disorder led to Mehserle's pulling out his gun, shooting Grant and then immediately telling Pirone, &quot; 'Tony, I thought he was going for his gun,' &quot; Stein said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You'll see for yourselves that Mr. Grant wasn't resisting,&quot; Stein said. &quot;He was in the process of putting his hands behind his back offering himself up for arrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Stein displayed what at times was chaos on the platform and highlighted the constant foul language and aggression used by Pirone, Mehserle's defense attorney Michael Rains appeared less emotional as he addressed the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains, in part, placed blame on BART for the shooting, citing minimal training of officers in the use of Tasers and what Rains suggested was a substandard policy for equipping officers with the device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, Rains said, Stein was correct when pointing out that, at times, Pirone appeared to not act professionally. However, Rains said, Pirone was not on trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Stein didn't spend that much time talking about Mr. Mehserle,&quot; Rains said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's because, Rains said, Mehserle was on the train platform for only 2&frac12; minutes before he fired a shot into Grant's back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Rains agreed Pirone's language was not professional, he said the aggression Pirone showed was provoked by Grant and his friends, who Rains said tried to strike blows at the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, the content of the videos will be left up to the jury to interpret. But Rains and Stein each suggested the videos will show different things happening   with Stein saying they will show police aggression and Rains saying they will show suspects resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains said the videos show Mehserle acting calm and in control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is in complete control for the entire 2&frac12; minutes until the fatal shot is fired,&quot; Rains said of Mehserle. &quot;He had no beef with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had no animosity with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains said Mehserle made a mistake caused by a lack of training in the use of Tasers and has resulted in the 28-year-old already living in a prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the rest of his life, (Mehserle) will be trapped in a wretched prison of his own memories,&quot; Rains said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains said that a frame-by-frame analysis of certain videos will prove that Mehserle struggled to remove his gun from its holster because he believed he was trying to grab his Taser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mehserle is tugging on his gun, he is tugging on his gun with such force,&quot; Rains said. &quot;The gun won't come out because he is using the wrong movement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That frame-by-frame analysis of the video also shows, Rains said, that Mehserle had a look of shock on his face once he fired his gun, then quickly put his hands to his head and leaned over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is sick to his stomach and wants to vomit because he's just shot a man that he did not want to shoot,&quot; Rains said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a chaotic situation when an officer's stress level is at its peak, an officer no longer thinks about what he is doing and reacts on the training he has been provided, Rains said. Because Mehserle had only six hours of training using a Taser, he became confused and believed his gun was his Taser, Rains said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our brains don't have a dummy light to come on in stressful situations,&quot; Rains said. &quot;We are blind to the things happening right in front of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains also, for the first time, gave the jury and the public more personal information about Mehserle in what appears an attempt to humanize him for the jury. Rains talked about how Mehserle was born in Germany and ended up in Napa at age 4 when his family moved there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Mehserle won the &quot;most huggable&quot; award in high school and after graduation went to college to study computer programming before he changed his mind and enrolled in a police academy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains spent about two hours giving his opening statements, after which three witnesses were called to the stand. The first witness was a video technician from the District Attorney's Office who explained how she transferred videos of the shooting to a computer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other two witnesses were riders on the BART train who captured the killing on their digital cameras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Thursday, a white female juror was excused from the jury and replaced by a Latino woman, leaving the court with five alternates for the remainder of the trial. It is unknown why the juror was excused.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES -- &quot;They're beating us up for no reason. Let me call you back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those were the last words Sophia Mesa heard from her boyfriend, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III, before he was fatally shot by a BART police officer Jan. 1, 2009, she testified Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa took the witness stand in the murder case against former BART police officer Johannes Mehserle to explain to the jury, among other things, that Grant had a fear of Tasers dating to an incident in 2006 when he was stunned by San Leandro police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy District Attorney David Stein called Mesa, 26, in the middle of the testimony of several passengers who witnessed Grant's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa remained calm throughout her testimony, pausing once to compose herself before explaining how she watched Grant get wheeled out of the Fruitvale BART station on a stretcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I kept calling and calling. He picked up my call, it was fast,&quot; Mesa said. &quot;He said, 'They're beating us up for no reason. Let me call you back.' Then he hung up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later she said, &quot;I heard a loud -- the gunshot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa said it was the last time she talked to Grant, the father of her now-6-year-old daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa described what she called a &quot;pushing&quot; match that began between Grant and another man on the train before it arrived at Fruitvale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was that confrontation, which various people have described as either a fight or an argument, that brought police to the station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa said it wasn't much of a fight, and said it was over by the time the train stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesa did not explain why she left Grant on the train at the Fruitvale station, but the defense contends that she and Grant decided that he should remain on the train to avoid arrest. Grant was ordered to get off the train by BART police Officer Anthony Pirone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant was on probation and parole at the time. If he had been arrested, he could have been charged with violating his parole and sent back to prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury will not learn that Grant was on parole, but defense attorney Michael Rains seized on Mesa's testimony to highlight Grant's past arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a tense cross-examination, Rains peppered Mesa with questions about why Grant feared Tasers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did he tell you that it involved the San Leandro police?&quot; Rains asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; Mesa replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did he tell you that he was running from the police?&quot; Rains asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rains continued to ask questions about the incident until he was interrupted by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The point is, (Grant) had a prior incident in which he was Tased,&quot; Perry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other BART passengers, all part of a group of friends, also testified about the incident in similar fashion, saying BART police acted aggressively toward Grant and his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They all also said the shooting was a complete surprise and, in their view, unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pamela Caneva said she remembers how she saw Mehserle standing over Grant while former BART police officer Anthony Pirone had his knee against Grant's neck. At that point, she said, she saw Mehserle reach for his right hip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said to my friend, 'He's not going to shoot him, is he?'&quot; she said. &quot;And then he shot him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witnesses said that Mehserle put his hands to his head after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
