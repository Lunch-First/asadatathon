<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON: Protesters clashed with police and looted stores in a suburb of St Louis after an officer shot dead an unarmed black teen, local media reported yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police armed with clubs hurled teargas and deployed officers with dogs to curb the violence that erupted late on Sunday in Ferguson, in the Midwestern state of Missouri. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But local law enforcement officers were quickly overwhelmed and had to urgently call for back-up from nearby communities, according to KSDK TV 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A video posted by the St Louis Post-Dispatch showed a service station convenience store plundered and set on fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looters also raided a Walmart and several other smaller stores, and set fires elsewhere, the newspaper reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence broke out after large crowds of mostly African-American protesters gathered on Sunday for a vigil at the spot where 18-year-old Michael Brown died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of Brown's death differ. A witness told KMOV News 4 that he was walking with Brown when a police officer confronted them and drew his weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer shot Brown, who &quot;turned around and put his hands in the air&quot;, Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He started to get down and the officer still approached and fired several more shots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, however, said Brown was killed after physically assaulting a police officer and struggling to get his weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar did not say whether the officer was white, but the Post-Dispatch said the incident brings to light the tension between the mostly white local police force and the African-American community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St Louis County chapter of the NAACP civil rights group said it had launched an investigation and called for a meeting yesterday &quot;in response to the recent murder of Mike Brown&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's grief-stricken mother, Lesley McSpadden, told KMOV TV that her son had just graduated from high school and planned to attend college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Not many,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because you bring them down to this type of level, where they feel like they don't got nothing to live for anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's family have hired attorney Benjamin Crump to represent them, the Post-Dispatch said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump is the lawyer who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the black teen shot and killed in Florida by George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watchman, in February 2012. - Sapa-AFP</SPAN></P>
