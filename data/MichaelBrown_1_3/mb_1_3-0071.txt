There was rioting and looting in the town of Ferguson, Missouri, on Sunday night as protests over the shooting of a black teenager by a police officer turned violent, police said. 
Crowds broke windows of cars and stores, set a building alight and looted shops following a day of demonstrations over the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old shot on Saturday by a Ferguson police officer.
There is "a lot of unrest, and a lot of rioting, and looting", officer Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St Louis County Police Department, said.
He said the unrest had spread from Ferguson, a largely black St Louis suburb, to adjacent communities. About 150 officers in riot gear had been sent to the area.
Officer Schellman said arrests had been made but had no details. Police said Mr Brown was shot after an alleged struggle over a gun in a police car. The officer involved is a six-year veteran and has been put on administrative leave. 
Mr Brown's mother told TV station KSDK her son was a "good child getting ready to go to college".
