The weekend shooting of Michael Brown, 18, who was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., a St. Louis suburb, is drawing outrage on social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook. The shooting is now being investigated by the F.B.I. 
There are short video clips and Vines being posted by protesters at a rally on Monday, carrying signs like the one below that says, ''I can be killed by the police but shouldn't.''

A popular hashtag is #iftheygunnedmedown. Mostly being used by young African-Americans, each Twitter post with the hashtag shows two pictures. The first is something positive, such as a high school graduation, the poster flanked by relatives, diploma in hand; the other photo is more candid and shows a face enveloped by smoke or a swig from a bottle of whiskey. The point is the contrast, and the juxtaposition. Some of the images are graphic, but here are two that show the sentiment of the discussion.
