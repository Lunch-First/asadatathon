<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US President Barack Obama on Tuesday appealed for calm after what he called the &quot;heartbreaking&quot; death of a black teenager killed in a police shooting in Missouri that sparked rioting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looters targeted more than a dozen businesses in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson overnight Sunday after a vigil on the sidewalk where Michael Brown died erupted into clashes with police armed with tear gas, clubs and rubber bullets.<BR><BR>Witnesses and police have given conflicting versions of how the 18-year-old was shot in broad daylight on Saturday, two days before he was due to start college.<BR><BR>&quot;The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time,&quot; Obama said in a statement, his first public reaction to the incident, which has stirred racial tensions.<BR><BR>&quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,&quot; Obama added.<BR><BR>&quot;We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that's what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.&quot;<BR><BR>The FBI opened a civil rights investigation on Monday into Brown's death, with his family demanding justice.<BR><BR>Brown's death stirred comparisons to the February 2012 fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida by pistol-toting neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who claimed he acted in self-defense. He went on to be acquitted of murder, two years ago this week.<BR><BR>It also renewed a debate about race and law enforcement in the United States, a month after the death of an asthmatic African-American father of five who was subjected to a &quot;choke hold&quot; by New York police in full view of passers-by.<BR> Muscat Press and Publishing House SAOC 2014  </SPAN></P>
