<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the request of local authorities and at the direction of Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr., our respective offices have opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting death of Michael Brown that occurred in Ferguson, Missouri, this past Saturday.  In conducting the independent federal investigation into whether there were federal civil rights violations, we will be working as much as possible with the local authorities who are determining whether there were any state law violations. While the investigation will be handled as expeditiously as possible, our pledge to the community is that it will be a thorough and complete investigation, following the facts wherever they may take us.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We urge witnesses or individuals with any information related to the incident who have not yet come forward to contact the local FBI office.  The FBI office in St. Louis can be reached at (314) 589-2500. </SPAN></P>
