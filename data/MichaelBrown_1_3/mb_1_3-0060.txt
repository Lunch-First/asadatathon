KANSAS CITY: Police arrested 32 people after rioting and looting erupted in Ferguson, Missouri, late on Sunday and spread to neighbouring towns in protests that turned violent over the killing of a black teenager by a police officer, officials said yesterday.
Police with clubs hurled tear gas and used dogs to curb the violence after protesters had gathered for a vigil at the spot where police shot and killed Michael Brown, 18, a day earlier.
