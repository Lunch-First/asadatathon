<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BARACK OBAMA earned both praise and criticism on Friday for his careful intervention in the case of an unarmed black youth whose killing last month sparked a bitter debate that has once again exposed the racial fault lines in American society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old Florida high school student, was shot by George Zimmerman, a white man who had volunteered for a neighbourhood watch patrol. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has inflamed African-American activists and presented Obama with a challenge that underlines how little his historic presidency has changed the suspicions and antagonism between American blacks and other ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, the 28-year-old son of a white father and a Hispanic mother, was yesterday reported to be in hiding after receiving death threats. The local police chief, who initially declined to charge Zimmerman with any crime, has &quot;temporarily&quot; stepped aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an initial reluctance to intervene in a case still under police review, Obama struck an intensely personal note on Friday when he urged a comprehensive investigation of the circumstances of Martin's death, and added: &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the president's right-wing rivals promptly accused him of striking a note of racial divisiveness at a time when it was not clear why Martin was shot. Zimmerman's father has insisted his son is not a racist, and his lawyer claimed the volunteer acted in self-defence after being threatened by Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet support for the president emerged from a broad political spectrum, including Republicans who noted that Martin was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There really is an issue of whether if you are black in America today, if you are dressed the way you are dressed, that can make you a victim,&quot; said Ari Fleischer, former press spokesman for George W Bush. &quot;These are society's most delicate issues, and I thought the president handled it delicately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's cautious response - which came almost a month after Martin was shot on February 26 - reflected the uproar he caused in 2009 when he made an off-the-cuff remark about the arrest by a white police officer of Henry Louis Gates, a black Harvard University professor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said at the time that the police had acted &quot;stupidly&quot;, and was widely assailed for taking sides before he knew the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think [the president] has probably gotten some better advice about how to handle those situations,&quot; noted one Republican former police officer who had criticised Obama over the Gates incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newt Gingrich, one of the Republican presidential hopefuls, denounced Obama for &quot;trying to turn it into a racial issue&quot;. Gingrich called the president's remarks &quot;disgraceful&quot;, and added: &quot;We should all be horrified no matter what the racial background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Gingrich appeared to be in a minority as investigators scrutinised Zimmerman's record as a volunteer security man and Martin emerged as a quiet youth who had never shown aggressive behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday it was claimed that Zimmerman was a zealous member of his local patrol who had called the police 46 times to report suspicious behaviour over the past eight years. He had attempted to become a policeman, and attended law enforcement classes, but appears never to have graduated as a bona fide officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day Martin died, Zimmerman called police to report a suspicious teenager who was &quot;coming to check me out&quot;, according to a transcript of the call. &quot;He's got something in his hands. I don't know what his deal is. Send officers over here,&quot; Zimmerman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin then ran away and when Zimmerman said he was following the teenager, the police dispatcher told him: &quot;We don't need you to do that.&quot; Minutes later Martin was dead.</SPAN></P>
