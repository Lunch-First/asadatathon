PRESIDENT Barack Obama yesterday called for national "soul searching" in the US over the death of black teenager, shot by a white neighbourhood watch leader. George Zimmerman, 28, caused outrage after he shot Trayvon Martin, 17, and claimed it was self defence. 
Mr Obama, who has two daughters, said: "When I think about this boy I think about my own kids. If I had a son he'd look like Trayvon.
"I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative to investigate every aspect of this. "I think all of us have to do some soul searching to figure out how does something like this happen."
An online petition over the shooting in Orlando, Florida, attracted 1.5million signatures and hundreds of children left schools in protest. Zimmerman, who shot Trayvon despite being warned to leave him when he called police, is yet to be charged.
