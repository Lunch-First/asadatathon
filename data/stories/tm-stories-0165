<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 25--CHICAGO -- Reverend Michael Pfleger of Saint Sabina Church urged parishioners to bring hooded sweatshirts, Skittles and cans of iced tea to mass on Sunday---the items that African-American Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was carrying when he was shot last month by a neighborhood watch volunteer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday several hundred people rallied at Daley Plaza, demanding justice for Trayvon, who was shot to death while walking to his father's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His killer, 28-year-old George Zimmerman, was never arrested or charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claims the shooting was in self defense, and that therefore he is protected from prosecution by Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoodies, Skittles and cans of iced tea have become symbols of support for Trayvon and his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Pfleger asked churches around the country to place the items atop their altars during Sunday mass.</SPAN></P>
