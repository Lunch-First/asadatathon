<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, FLA.-Members of the New Black Panther Party are offering a $10,000 (U.S.) reward for the &quot;capture&quot; of George Zimmerman, leader Mikhail Muhammad announced Saturday during a rally in a day of nationwide protests against the slaying of a Florida teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked whether he was inciting violence to get vigilante justice for slain teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Muhammad replied: &quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bounty announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilization of 5,000 black men to capture George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer in a gated community considered mostly white, who shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on Feb. 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman remains free and uncharged over the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the shooting in Sanford, a town just north of Orlando, has galvanized America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland and Jacksonville - where the 28-year-old worked before the shooting, employees there told the Orlando Sentinel. But he declined to say when they will begin their hunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman believed the young man walking through the gated community in a &quot;hoodie,&quot; or hooded sweatshirt, looked suspicious, said his lawyer, Craig Sonner, and called the police nonemergency line to report a suspicious person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, unarmed, had been walking back to his father's fianc&eacute;e's townhouse. Zimmerman followed and an altercation ensued, ending when Zimmerman shot him before officers could respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the City of Sanford website, city manager Norton Bonaparte says Zimmerman &quot;holds a concealed weapon permit issued from the state of Florida,&quot; allowing him to carry a gun that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Saturday's protest in Sanford, leader Muhammad led the Panther protest in chanting &quot;Justice for Trayvon!&quot; and &quot;Black Power!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the government won't do the job, we'll do it,&quot; he said, leading his group of eight party members in chants like &quot;freedom or death&quot; and &quot;justice for Trayvon&quot; while making the iconic gesture of raising their fists into the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad added that the group's national chairman, Dr. Malik Zulu Shabaz, is receiving donations from black entertainers and athletes. They hope to collect $1 million by next week, he added.</SPAN></P>
