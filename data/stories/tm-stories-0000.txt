WASHINGTON (DPA) _ Thousands of Americans have rallied in cities across the country to protest the shooting death last month of an unarmed Florida teenager, in a case that has struck a nerve in a country still plagued by racial divisions. 
Dressed in black ``hoodie" sweatshirts like the one Trayvon Martin was wearing when he was shot, and chanting ``no justice, no peace," protesters in cities including Washington DC, Chicago, Tampa and Nashville yesterday (our time) demanded justice in a case that many felt demonstrated lingering racism in American law and society.
In Washington DC, as many as 2000 people came to the steps of the mayor's office for a rally hastily organised over Twitter and Facebook.
``Even with all the positive images you might see with Obama being president and a lot of steps we've made, we're not completely there yet. You can still be murdered for being black in this country," said Bless Davis, standing in a light rain at the Washington rally with his son, Logan, 3 on his shoulders.
The teenager at the heart of the protests was Trayvon Martin, 17, an African- American who was killed February 26 in Sanford, a suburb of Orlando.
His apparent killer was George Zimmerman, 28, is white and reportedly of Latino descent.
