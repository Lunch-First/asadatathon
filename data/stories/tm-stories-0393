<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US officials are investigating the fatal shooting of an unarmed black Florida teenager by a white neighbourhood watch volunteer that has sparked national outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, was shot on February 26 in a gated community in central Florida by a neighbourhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, who later was released by police after claiming he acted in self-defence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Martin&quot;s family, said Martin had put on a hoodie after getting caught in the rain and was not aware he was being followed by Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He&quot;s just a kid trying to get home from the store and get out of the rain. That&quot;s it, nothing else,&quot; Crump told a news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Martin&quot;s 16-year-old girlfriend was on the phone with him at the time and heard most of the altercation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What Zimmerman said is completely contradicted by the phone log,&quot; Crump added, urging authorities to arrest the neighbourhood watchman for killing Martin &quot;in cold blood&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to ABC News, the girlfriend recalled that Martin &quot;said this man was watching him, so he put his hoodie on. He said he lost the man&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I asked Trayvon to run, and he said he was going to walk fast. I told him to run, but he said he was not going to run,&quot; added the girlfriend, who was not identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said its Civil Rights Division plans to &quot;conduct a thorough and independent review of all of the evidence&quot;. The division examines cases in which discrimination on the basis of race, sex, disability, religion, and national origin are suspected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI is also investigating the racially charged killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin&quot;s case is heading to a grand jury, where a diverse group of citizens will decide whether to bring charges against Zimmerman, according to the local state attorney&quot;s office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I share in the desire of the family and the community to accurately collect and evaluate all the facts surrounding the tragic death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Norman Wolfinger, state attorney for Brevard and Seminole counties, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
