Regarding the New York Times article "Self-Defense Law Is Under the Gun after Fla. Killing," printed in the PG March 21, I am unsure of the journalist's motive to label George Zimmerman, the shooter, as a white Hispanic. Are we at the level of detail now in which our grand rainbow society must endure further classifications such as black-white, black-Hispanic, Hispanic-white, white-Indian, Hispanic-Indian, etc.? Is the article trying to imply because he is part white he may be racist and therefore shot a black teenager? 
To me it looks like you have a neighborhood watch guy who decided to step into a role of a professional policeman, a position that Mr. Zimmerman was ill-trained to do, which resulted in him becoming a vigilante. A beautiful human being, Trayvon Martin, was killed. Then a brain-dead system allows Mr. Zimmerman to walk under Florida's self-defense law.
Let's hope the blind lady of justice will have the final word and reporters can continue to classify people to suit their fancy or view of the world.
