<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin is an illustration of how dangerous badly drafted laws can be. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of the unarmed 17-year-old boy, shot by a self-appointed neighbourhood-watch volunteer, has prompted demands that the shooter be arrested. Under Florida's controversial &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, that is likely not possible. The law says people have the right to use deadly force if they &quot;reasonably&quot; believe they or other persons are threatened with death or serious harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was detained but released by police who say they believed his account that Martin started the scuffle and that Zimmerman fired in self-defence. Under the law, there is no requirement to prove either imminent danger or the need to use deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Canada, we have had our own self-defence debate in recent years. The result is a streamlined law that gives those acting in self-defence more leeway and should avoid future cases such as that of Toronto shopkeeper David Chen, who was charged with assault and forcible confinement after tying up a man who had stolen some plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clarifying archaic laws is a good thing, but giving vigilantes power to take the law into their hands is not.</SPAN></P>
