PITTSFIELD -- A group of concerned citizens is planning to rally at Park Square on Friday evening to protest the killing of an unarmed teenager in Florida and the decision of authorities there not to arrest the shooter. 
"I really believe the tragedy was not just that this young man was gunned down, but the injustice done by the system down there in Florida that has still not arrested this man," said Ty Allan Jackson of Pittsfield.
Jackson, a local author who is organizing the event as part of the S.E.E.D network, said he expects a crowd of about 100. The rally is scheduled to take place between 5:30 and 7:30 p.m. on Friday.
Trayvon Martin, 17, was killed Feb. 26, in Sanford, Fla. He was returning to a gated community in the city after buying candy at a convenience store. He was unarmed and was wearing a hooded sweatshirt, called a hoodie.
The Sanford neighborhood's watch captain, George Zimmerman, has not been charged in the shooting. Zimmerman has said the teen attacked him and he shot him in self-defense.
Like similar protests in New York City and elsewhere, those rallying at the Park Square events will wear hoodies to express solidarity with Martin and his family.
Jackson called the failure of police to arrest Zimmerman for shooting the young, black teen a "slap in the face for people of color." He said he hopes to increase awareness of the incident through the Pittsfield rally.
"It's frustrating to witness this violence and be powerless," Jackson said. "But we're not powerless and we have a voice. And it's important to use that voice to let the world know that we're no longer going to tolerate these injustices and we're going to hold people accountable."
