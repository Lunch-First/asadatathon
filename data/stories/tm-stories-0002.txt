March 26--Amid a new report that unarmed Florida teen Trayvon Martin had attacked his killer before he was fatally shot, several Albany lawmakers Monday wore hoodies in solidarity, while Mayor Michael Bloomberg lashed out against the use of illegal guns. 
The Orlando Sentinel reported that Martin, 17, punched George Zimmerman, knocked him down and then slammed his head repeatedly into the sidewalk, according to an account Zimmerman, 32, gave to police that was mostly corroborated by witnesses.
Zimmerman, a white Hispanic neighborhood watch captain, was patrolling his gated community in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26 and mistook Martin for a burglar. The black teen was wearing a hoodie and was coming from a convenience store. Zimmerman said he shot Martin out of self-defense.
Bloomberg, speaking at an unrelated news conference, accused the gun lobby in Washington, D.C., of "writing our nation's gun laws."
Bloomberg is co-chair of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns coalition, which is asking lawyers to help with research connected to the shooting.
The mayor questioned why Zimmerman was allowed to conceal and carry a loaded gun after a previous arrest for assaulting a police officer.
"This is just the craziest thing," Bloomberg said.
The Albany legislators who dressed in hooded sweatshirts said they did so to protest the shooting and call attention to racial profiling.
The U.S. Justice Department is investigating the case as a potential hate crime.
