<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 23--NEW YORK -- From a group shot with Miami Heat players ... all of them dressed in black hoodie sweatshirts to the New York Knicks' own Amar'e Stoudemire in own hoodie pic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This single piece of clothing -- and the stereotype that whoever is wearing one is suspicious -- has become a flashpoint in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's what Martin wore when he was shot and killed by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman in a gated community last month in Sanford, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even President Obama is weighing in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He empathized today with the slain 17-year old's grieving parents, saying&quot; You know if i had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are gonna take this with the seriousness it deserves and get to the bottom of what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, rallies and vigils are happening more frequently with demonstrations growing in scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students in several Florida high schools took to the streets today in a show of solidarity, pushing for an arrest &Acirc;- and criminal charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So who is George Zimmerman?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's a former altar boy, and passionate -- some would even say over zealous -- protector of his gated neighborhood in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But remember this photo Zimmerman? It's actually mug shot, from an arrest for pushing a Florida state alcohol agent who tried to arrest his friend &Acirc;- a bartender, accused of serving drinks to minors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zimmerman got his act together, and by all accounts relished his role as a volunteer neighborhood watchman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Florida's black community as already weighed, but Zimmerman's lawyer, who claims the incident was not racially motivated. &quot;The answer is absolutely not. George is friends with people in the African-American community, said attorney Craig Sonner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
