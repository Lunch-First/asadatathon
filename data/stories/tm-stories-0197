</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DeMar DeRozan poured in a season-high 30 points and the Toronto Raptors cooled off the red-hot New York Knicks with a 96-79 victory Friday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrea Bargnani added 21 points and seven rebounds for the Raptors (16-32), who handed the Knicks their first loss under interim coach Mike Woodson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amar'e Stoudemire - who wore a hoodie during warm-ups in support of slain Florida teen Trayvon Martin - led the Knicks (23-25) with 17 points and six rebounds. New York came into the game on a five-game win streak that started with the resignation of former coach Mike D'Antoni on March 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes after putting down an alley-oop dunk in the fourth, DeRozan fell awkwardly on Jose Calderon while battling for a rebound. He got up gingerly, ran off the floor and into the tunnel. He did not return and there was no report on his condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a miserable night for the Knicks' emerging star Jeremy Lin. The point guard went 3 for 9 and finished the night with six points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Raptors, who crumbled late in the game against Chicago on Wednesday, looked shaky early in the fourth as New York pulled to within 70-60 on four points from J.R. Smith and a three-pointer by Steve Novak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Knicks came out aggressive in the third as Lin hit a jumper from the corner and a Stoudamire dunk made it 41-40 just two minutes into the second half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lin heard plenty of boos as he clanked two three-point attempts in the second quarter.</SPAN></P>
