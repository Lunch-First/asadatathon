<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI (AP) - Attorneys for the family of Trayvon Martin and the Florida neighborhood watch captain who fatally shot the unarmed teen joined the national chorus of voices calling Saturday for justice in the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As demonstrators took to the streets in major cities such as Washington and Chicago to voice outrage over Martin's death and the local police investigation of it, an attorney for the Martin family told board members of the National Association of Black Journalists that federal and local officials have assured the family that the case is a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, an attorney representing the neighborhood watch captain, 28-year-old George Zimmerman, broadly defended his client and said he believes evidence will show that Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law was properly applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has not been charged in the Feb. 26 shooting that has ignited racial tensions and raised questions about the Sanford police's handling of the case. Martin was black, and Zimmerman's father is white and his mother is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is George a racist? The answer is no, absolutely not. He's not a racist,&quot; attorney Craig Sonner said about his client. &quot;The incident that transpired is not racially motivated or a hate crime in any way. It was self-defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonner declined to detail what transpired between Zimmerman and the 17-year-old Martin, but he said he believes the case falls under Florida's stand-your-ground law, which dictates that a person has the right to stand his or her ground and &quot;meet force with force&quot; if attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If charges are brought against his client, Zimmerman would be willing to turn himself in to police, Sonner said.</SPAN></P>
