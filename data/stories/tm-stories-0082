<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are good reasons why the killing of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old black youth who was shot to death by a neighborhood watch volunteer while walking through a gated community in Florida, has attracted national outrage. Martin, who was unarmed, was slain by a Latino man named George Zimmerman, who had been pursuing Martin through the neighborhood, outweighed him by more than 100 pounds and was armed with a handgun. Yet Zimmerman claims that he acted in self-defense - and local police initially agreed, saying they didn't have enough evidence to charge Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, the matter won't end there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The public outcry in a case with heavy racial overtones has attracted the notice of the Justice Department, which is launching an investigation. It's easy to make a case for self-defense when you kill your only witness, and laws like Florida's encourage a dangerous shoot-first mentality.</SPAN></P>
