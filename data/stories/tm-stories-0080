<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The co-chair of a local neighborhood watch group said the Florida man accused of shooting an unarmed teen should have let police handle the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personally, I think the shooter responded the wrong way. I think he should have kept it in the hands of law enforcement,&quot; said Harold Cox Jr., co-chair of the Manor Avenue and Court Neighborhood Association. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26 has touched off a storm of protest from across the country. The teen was shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, who said he started following Martin because he looked suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman said he shot Martin in self-defense, although a police dispatcher had discouraged Zimmerman from following Martin in the first place. Zimmerman faces no criminal charges, but authorities on several levels are continuing to investigate the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shooting also has renewed debate about Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; self-defense law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cox said volunteers in his group are advised to not approach people who might be involved in illegal activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Be careful, don't put yourself at risk. If you see some type of activity you're not happy with, call 911. That's basically the easiest route,&quot; Cox said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jack Campbell, chief deputy of the Sangamon County Sheriff 's Office, had the same advice for anyone who believes someone is acting suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Definitely, do not take any proactive steps to follow that person. Don't confront them,&quot; Campbell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We want neighborhood watches to be our eyes and ears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When someone calls 911 about a suspicious person, dispatchers are going to ask for a description of the person, including their clothes and their approximate height and weight. If the person is in a vehicle, observers should note the make, model and license plates if possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The neighborhood watch group patrols regularly in Cox's neighborhood, which is near Lawrence Avenue and Livingston Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Crime has gone down a lot&quot; as a result of the patrols, he said. &quot;You have more of your neighbors involved now. Everybody is looking out for each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Reynolds can be reached at 788-1524. The Associated Press contributed to this article.</SPAN></P>
