<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case of the unarmed Florida teenager killed last month by a neighborhood watch volunteer - let go by cops after he claimed he shot in self-defense - will at long last go to a county grand jury in early April. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local authorities announced the investigation Tuesday, shortly after the Justice Department stepped in to probe possible civil rights violations. The shooter is Hispanic; the victim was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal action filled a void that for many Americans, particularly blacks, recalled law enforcement inaction in the face of anti-black violence that once plagued the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, though, the poison may not be racism but the psychotic love affair with guns that afflicts too much of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much about the Feb. 26 killing in Sanford, Fla., is not known - but many details have emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was walking to his father's fianc&eacute;e's house from a store, carrying a bag of Skittles and an iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know George Zimmerman had called cops 46 times since January 2011, reporting everything from open windows to disturbances to break-ins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know he saw Trayvon and deemed him suspicious. He told a 911 dispatcher, &quot;this guy looks like he's up to no good or on drugs or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;These a--holes, they always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know Trayvon felt threatened by Zimmerman, who followed him in a sport-utility vehicle, then on foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know Trayvon broke into a run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know the 911 dispatcher asked Zimmerman, &quot;Are you following him?&quot; then added, &quot;Okay, you don't need to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know Zimmerman continued to trail Trayvon, that there was a chase, a struggle and a bullet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we know how cops explained their decision to let Zimmerman go. In 2005, gun-happy Florida enacted the insane Stand Your Ground law. Where citizens had been required to retreat from confrontations, if possible, the statute told Floridians to shoot if they felt threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of criminal defendants claiming justifiable homicide has tripled in the state, and the defense has worked in most cases.So Zimmerman killed an unarmed teenager and police were poised to drop the matter without investigation. The first of these wrongs cannot be reversed. There is still time to correct the second.</SPAN></P>
