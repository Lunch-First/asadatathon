</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief of a Florida town where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a neighbourhood watch volunteer said on Thursday he would temporarily step down from his job, saying his role in the investigation had become too much of a distraction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee had been heading up the investigation into the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by watch captain George Zimmerman, 28. The incident has sparked a nationwide public outcry over Florida's Stand Your Ground law, which Zimmerman says makes the killing self defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have declined to arrest Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee called himself a distraction and said it had become &quot;apparent that my involvement in the matter is overshadowing the process.&quot; He has been on the job less than one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford City Manager Norton Bonaparte, speaking at a press conference at City Hall, said he was starting a search for an interim police chief. In the interim, he said, two current captains will head the police force, which has 140 officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What the city of Sanford wants more than anything else for the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin family is justice,&quot; Bonaparte said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee's decision to step down comes a day after Sanford's city commissioners passed a motion of no confidence in him and follows calls for his resignation by civil rights groups angered over the police department's handling of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee previously said he had no choice under Florida's controversial Stand Your Ground law but to let Zimmerman go free. The 2005 law allows someone in fear of &quot;great bodily harm&quot; to respond with deadly force, and removes any duty to retreat if possible to avoid confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Feb. 26, Martin was returning to a gated community from a candy run at a convenience store when Zimmerman, carrying a licensed handgun in his role as a neighbourhood watch captain, saw him. He called police to report a &quot;suspicious guy&quot; and followed him despite the dispatcher's advice not to do so. Neighbours said they heard a scuffle, cries for help and then a gunshot.</SPAN></P>
