And I think [his parents] are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.' - President Obama yesterday </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WASHINGTON - President Obama yesterday cast a national spotlight on the racially charged killing of unarmed black teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, telling the nation, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taking a rare personal tack, Obama took on the wrenching Florida case during an unrelated Rose Garden ceremony - stopping unexpectedly to answer a reporter's question about the shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama said he wanted to choose his words carefully to avoid &quot;impairing&quot; the Justice Department investigation into the shooting of the 17-year-old boy by a white neighborhood-watch volunteer last month in Sanford, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;But my main message is to the parents of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said. &quot;And I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it &shy;deserves, and that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added solemnly, &quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president usually walks away from the podium without answering questions after events like yesterday's announcement of his nominee to lead the World Bank. But this time, Obama fielded the question, which he was well prepared to answer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By weighing in, the country's first black president not only made it personal but drew &shy;national attention to what had been a Florida controversy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The teen was shot dead the night of Feb. 28 by George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old man of mixed white and Hispanic ethnicity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman has claimed self-defense and has not been &shy;arrested. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trayvon had been visiting relatives in Sanford and was on his way back to their home from a &shy;7-Eleven, carrying only a bag of Skittles and a can of Arizona Iced Tea and wearing a hoodie, when he was shot dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The killing and muted police response spurred huge rallies and protests, as prominent black leaders charged that police would have treated the case differently if Trayvon had been white. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee &shy;resigned temporarily this week, saying the blaring criticism of his handling of the case had become a distraction from the investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The hoodie has emerged as a symbol of the unjust stereotype that has been placed on black teens like Trayvon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Supporters have donned hoodies at rallies, and NBA stars LeBron James and Dwyane Wade and their Miami Heat teammates, as well as Knick star Carmelo &shy;Anthony, have posted photos of themselves wearing hoodies on Twitter in a gesture of solidarity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Knicks forward Amar'e Stoudemire - a Central Florida native - arrived in Toronto yesterday wearing a hooded sweater in tribute to Martin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The national outcry prompted Justice Department prosecutors and the FBI to open an investigation this week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Well, I'm the head of the Executive Branch, and the attorney general reports to me, so I've got to be careful about my statements to make sure that we're not impairing any investigation that's taking place right now,&quot; Obama said in the Rose Garden. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;But obviously this is a tragedy. I can only imagine what these parents are going through,&quot; the president said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pulls together - federal, state and local - to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama continued, &quot;So I'm glad that not only is the Justice Department looking into it, I understand now that the governor of the state of Florida has formed a task force to investigate what's taking place.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think all of us have to do some soul-searching to figure out how does something like this happen. And that means that &shy;we examine the laws and the context for what happened, as well as the specifics of the incident.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president's personal intervention only increased pressure for speedy action from Florida Gov. Rick Scott, state Attorney General Pam Bondi and the special prosecutor they appointed Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Travyon's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, &shy;issued a statement after Obama spoke. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The president's personal comments touched us deeply and made us wonder: If his son looked liked Trayvon and wore a hoodie, would he be suspicious, too?&quot; the statement read. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We'd like to thank the president and the millions of people from around the world who have shown their support for Trayvon.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman's father, Robert Zimmerman, defended his son in a recent letter to the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, writing, &quot;He would be the last to discriminate for any reason whatsoever.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Craig Sonner, Zimmerman's attorney, told CNN that his client shot Martin in self-defense after a fight. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I don't believe that George Zimmerman's a racist or that this was motivated by a dislike for African-Americans,&quot; Sonner said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also yesterday, Zimmerman broke his almost month-long silence and left a message on his strongest supporter's voicemail, according to MSNBC.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I wanted to thank you for doing everything you've been doing,&quot; Zimmerman said in the rambling message he left for Frank Taaffe, a former block captain in the gated community.  </SPAN></P>
