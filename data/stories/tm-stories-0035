<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of protesters are expected to join the parents of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin at a rally in Florida amid growing anger and increasing pressure on authorities to arrest the black teenager's killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Sanford said that up to 10,000 people could take part in the demonstration, which comes exactly a month after the 17-year-old was shot dead by self-appointed neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally is one of a series of events taking place across the US on Monday to protest against the handling of the case and the perceived failure to hold the 28-year-old to account over Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, vigils were held in churches across America in memory of Martin, who was killed as he walked back to the home of his father's girlfriend after a trip to nearby convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of preachers wore hooded tops in a sign of solidarity with the dead teenager's supporters. Martin was wearing a hoodie at the time of the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church in Eatonville, Florida, the Rev Jesse Jackson told a packed congregation on Sunday that &quot;the blood of the innocent has power&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson likened Martin to Emmett Till, the 14-year-old who was mutilated and murdered in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also listed Martin alongside assassinated civil rights leaders Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King Jr, adding that his &quot;martyr&quot; death should be used to draw attention to long-standing issues affecting the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev Jackson is expected to attend Monday's rally and a subsequent town hall meeting in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will be joined at the event by the teenager's parents Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, and fellow civil rights leader the Rev Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford authorities are expecting a large turnout at the demonstration, and have cordoned off streets around Fort Mellon Park, which has become a focal point of protest since Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Sanford police said they had been told that between 4,000 and 10,000 demonstrators will take part in the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the largest of a series of protests and demonstrations planned for Monday across the US, including one planned outside the US justice department in Washington DC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents will also take their concerns over the handling of the investigation to civic leaders at a town hall meeting in Sanford on Monday evening. It is the first such meeting since Martin's death thrust Sanford into the news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev Sharpton is likely to attend the discussions. On Sunday, he held talks with Martin's parents and their legal representatives over the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton tweeted this morning: &quot;Spent much of last night meeting with the parents and lawyers of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin about the legal and movement strategy for justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anger has grown in the weeks following Martin's death, amid claims of police failings in the case and an alleged racial element to the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Sanford police chief Bill Lee stepped down temporarily. He was joined soon after by state attorney Norman Wolfinger, who recused himself following criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But neither development, nor the intervention of President Barack Obama, who delivered a personal statement calling for a thorough investigation into Martin's deth, have quietened the discontent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman claims he killed in self-defence and that the teenager was acting suspiciously at the time of the incident, with a hooded top pulled over his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of Zimmerman have cited Florida's controversial &quot;stand your ground&quot; legislation, which authorises the use of lethal force in certain situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it has been alleged that Zimmerman may have profiled Martin due to his race. And a recorded conversation between Zimmerman and a 911 operator shortly before the incident may contain a racial slur - although this has been disputed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's lawyer, Craig Sooner, has denied that his client acted out of prejudice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the allegations have added to the anger felt and have led to widespread protest among the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, the New Black Panther Party - a fringe organisation accused by the US government of fostering an anti-white hate agenda -put a $10,000 bounty on Mr Zimmerman's head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the reward, the group's leader, Mikhail Muhammad, demanded an &quot;eye for an eye&quot; in relation to the Martin death.</SPAN></P>
