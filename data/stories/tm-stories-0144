<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT BARACK Obama weighed in to the controversial killing of a black teenager in Florida in very personal terms yesterday, comparing the boy to a son he doesn't have and calling for American &quot;soul searching&quot; over how the incident occurred. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin, dressed in a &quot;hoodie&quot;, was shot dead a month ago in Florida by a 28-year-old white Hispanic neighbourhood watch volunteer who said he was acting in self- defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said in his first comments about the shooting, acknowledging the racial element in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, this is a tragedy. I can only imagine what these parents are going through. And when I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has galvanized the nation and prompted rallies protesting the failure of police to arrest the shooter, George Zimmerman, and more broadly, a pattern of racial discrimination that black leaders cite in Florida and elsewhere in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents thanked the president for his words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law allows people to use deadly force in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar laws are in effect in at least 24 states including Florida, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Calls are mounting to repeal them. Earlier last week, a Florida state senator said he was drafting new legislation to drastically change the law in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bakari Sellers, a black Democrat and gun owner, said he wanted to prevent an incident like the shooting happening in his state. &quot;I'm six-five and a black guy,&quot; he said. &quot;I just know that it could have been me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said the laws should be studied. &quot;I think all of us have to do some soul-searching . . . And that means that we examine the laws . . . as well as the specifics of the incident,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford's police chief and a Florida state prosecutor overseeing the case stepped aside on Thursday as criticism grew over police handling of the investigation. REUTERS</SPAN></P>
