<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) - LeBron James had 17 points and 10 assists to lead the Miami Heat to their fourth straight victory, 88-73 over the Detroit Pistons on Friday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dwyane Wade added 24 points for the Heat, who posed for a photo earlier in the day wearing team-logo hoodies. Players were speaking out following the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed black teenager wearing a hooded sweatshirt who was shot by a neighborhood crime-watch volunteer last month in a suburb of Orlando, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Heat players, including Wade and James, took the floor with messages such as &quot;RIP Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot; and &quot;We want justice&quot; scrawled on their sneakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brandon Knight scored 18 points for the Pistons, who have lost five of six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wade posted a photo of himself from a previous photo shoot wearing a hooded shirt, otherwise known as a hoodie, to his Twitter and Facebook pages on Friday morning. A couple hours later, James posted another photo - this one of 13 Heat players, all wearing team-logo hoodies, their heads bowed, their hands stuffed into their pockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was killed as he was returning to a gated community, carrying candy and iced tea. A neighborhood crime-watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, said he acted in self-defense. He has not been arrested, though state and federal authorities are still investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests have popped up nationwide in recent days, with thousands of people - many of them wearing hoodies - calling for action. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra called the team photo &quot;a powerful move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the game started, the Heat made quick work of the Pistons. Miami led by 26 in the third quarter, although Detroit did rally to make it respectable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detroit trailed 72-57 after three and cut the deficit to single digits early in the fourth. After Jonas Jerebko's reverse dunk on a breakaway made it 74-65, the Heat took a timeout with 8:58 to play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wade made a floater to start a 10-2 run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detroit was without guard Rodney Stuckey, out with a sore left big toe. Ben Gordon, who made all nine of his 3-point attempts in a 45-point effort at Denver on Wednesday night, went 0 for 4 from beyond the arc and scored 10 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami's Joel Anthony returned to the lineup after missing Tuesday's win over Phoenix with a sprained left ankle. He scored six points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Heat shot 57 percent in the first half and finished the second quarter strong. Wade's layup off a pass from James with 4.3 seconds remaining made it 59-36, and Chris Bosh blocked Will Bynum's attempt at a driving layup at the other end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James intercepted a pass near midcourt in the third quarter and found Wade alone downcourt for an alley-oop dunk. Mario Chalmers then sank a 3-pointer to make it 70-44.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOTES: Knight now holds Detroit's rookie record for 3-pointers after making four Friday for a season total of 73. Lindsey Hunter made 69 in 1993-94. ... Miami's Mike Miller remained out with a sprained left ankle. ... Wade missed a streaking James in the fourth quarter on an alley-oop attempt when James was unable to handle a high pass.</SPAN></P>
