U.S. President Barack Obama has called for a full investigation into last month's killing of teenager Trayvon Martin.
Commenting for the first time on an event that has reignited the debate on race relations Stateside, Obama said: "When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids."
The Prez labelled the incident "a tragedy" and added: "If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon."
The death of the 17-year-old has led to outrage across the US after his killer George Zimmerman used controversial self-defence laws to avoid prosecution.
Protests have been held in recent days in Washington DC, Philadelphia and Chicago. Around 8,000 took part in the 'Million Hoodie March' in Philly on Friday night.
Demonstrators chanted: "Do I look suspicious? I am Trayvon Martin."
