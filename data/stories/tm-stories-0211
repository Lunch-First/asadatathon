<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 24--DALLAS, Texas -- About 100 people showed up at rally in front of Dallas City Hall Saturday evening demanding justice for Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from the outrage over the killing of the unarmed teen, people are questioning why George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer and the man accused of killing martin, was armed to begin with. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're setting yourself up for failure if you're confronting someone if you don't know if they are armed, unarmed and you have a gun and are prepared to shoot them&quot;, said Samantha Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman is accused of following martin even after a 911 operator tells him not to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The point is watch, neighborhood watch -- not neighborhood approach, neighborhood question. So if I see someone suspicious, I'm going to pass it on to the police. I'm not going to take it upon myself to confront the person&quot;, said Jessica Guilbeaux.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Forney, the case is being followed by many of the people who live here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There should have been something else that was done. And not a child who's young and doing nothing getting killed or hurt. i think it's ridiculous&quot;, said Forney resident Karla Bowden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forney has an active neighborhood watch with several volunteers. Bowden believes they should have some means of protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think that they should have guns but I think they should be armed with something to where they would be able to have a response to somebody if somebody came up and they were armed or if they were trying to hurt them&quot;, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watch volunteers in Forney are not allowed to carry weapons while on patrol even if they have a concealed hand gun license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The biggest issue we would have is we don't want law enforcement being handled by those that aren't trained to do it&quot;, said Forney City Manager Brian Brooks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers are given radios to call in any suspicious activity to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a trained and capable law enforcement community and our officers are best able to handle it&quot;, Brooks said.</SPAN></P>
