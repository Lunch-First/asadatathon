<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powerful reactions, and potent imagery, continue to emerge from the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama said Friday, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot; Members of the Miami Heat took a team picture wearing hoodies in memory of Martin. And in many cities, thousands have made striking visual statements by donning Martin's jacket of choice in such public protests as the Million Hoodie March in New York and the &quot;Hoodies on the Hill&quot; rally and prayer service outside the Capitol in the District. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's a cartoon depictions of the Florida teen's death that is stirring controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some readers of Rob Rogers, the editorial cartoonist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, are upset that in commenting on the fatal shooting, the artist has invoked the visceral imagery of a lynching, drawing the teenager's shooter, George Zimmerman, in the  hooded clothes of a Klansman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rogers stands staunchly behind his illustrated editorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The killing of African American teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman in Florida last month was not an act of self-defense,&quot; Rogers argued, noting that Martin was unarmed, toting only iced tea and Skittles. Rogers sees the killing as an act of &quot;racist violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that in mind, he wasn't about to pull any editorial punches as he rendered his judgment in ink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I realize that the image of a lynching can be disturbing and horrific, even in a cartoon,&quot; Rogers says. &quot;I can certainly understand why some readers may find such an image shocking and unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the other hand,&quot; he says, &quot;it is the job of an editorial cartoonist to push the boundaries and to use the power of an image to get a point across. I felt it was my job to show the horror of this injustice . . . with the hope that by bringing attention to it, maybe it won't happen as often.&quot;</SPAN></P>
