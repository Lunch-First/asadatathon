DeMar DeRozan poured in a season-high 30 points and the Toronto Raptors cooled off the red-hot New York Knicks with a 96-79 victory Friday night. 
Andrea Bargnani added 21 points and seven rebounds for the Raptors (16-32), who handed the Knicks their first loss under interim coach Mike Woodson.
Amar'e Stoudemire - who wore a hoodie during warm-ups in support of slain Florida teen Trayvon Martin - led the Knicks (23-25) with 17 points and six rebounds. New York came into the game on a five-game win streak that started with the resignation of former coach Mike D'Antoni on March 14.
Minutes after putting down an alley-oop dunk in the fourth, DeRozan fell awkwardly on Jose Calderon while battling for a rebound. He got up gingerly, ran off the floor and into the tunnel. He did not return and there was no report on his condition.
It was a miserable night for the Knicks' emerging star Jeremy Lin. The point guard went 3 for 9 and finished the night with six points.
The Raptors, who crumbled late in the game against Chicago on Wednesday, looked shaky early in the fourth as New York pulled to within 70-60 on four points from J.R. Smith and a three-pointer by Steve Novak.
The Knicks came out aggressive in the third as Lin hit a jumper from the corner and a Stoudamire dunk made it 41-40 just two minutes into the second half.
Lin heard plenty of boos as he clanked two three-point attempts in the second quarter.
