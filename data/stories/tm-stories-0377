<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. - An unarmed black teenager shot to death by a neighborhood watch captain told his girlfriend moments before he was killed that he was being followed, a lawyer said Tuesday as federal and state prosecutors announced they would investigate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Oh he's right behind me, he's right behind me again,'&quot; 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin told his girlfriend on his cellphone, the Martin family's attorney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The girl later heard Martin say, &quot;Why are you following me?&quot; Another man asked, &quot;What are you doing around here?'&quot; attorney Benjamin Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phone call that recorded Martin's final moments was disclosed as the U.S. Justice Department opened a federal civil rights probe into the Feb. 26 shooting and the local prosecutor convened a grand jury to investigate. A grand jury will meet April 10 to consider evidence in the case, said Seminole County State Attorney Norm Wolfinger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, has not been charged and said he shot Martin, who was returning to a gated community in Sanford after buying candy at a convenience store, in self-defense after Martin attacked him. Police say Zimmerman is white; his family says he is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She absolutely blows Zimmerman's absurd self-defense claim out of the water,&quot; Crump said of Martin's girlfriend, whose name was withheld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has ignited racial tensions in this Orlando suburb of 53,500 people, sparking rallies and a protest in Gov. Rick Scott's office on Tuesday. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said it is sending its community relations service this week to Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders from the NAACP, American Civil Liberties Union and the Nation of Islam urged residents to remain calm but demand that Zimmerman be arrested.</SPAN></P>
