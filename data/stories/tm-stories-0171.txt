PRESIDENT Barack Obama has called the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin (17) in a Florida suburb a "tragedy". He said "every aspect" of the case that has rallied civil rights activists should be investigated. "When I think about this boy I think about my own kids," the US President added.
