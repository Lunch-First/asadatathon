<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An alleged eyewitness is backing the 28-year-old gunman at the center of a national firestorm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A person named &quot;John&quot; told a Fox affiliate in Orlando that he saw an altercation unfold between George Zimmerman and 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, whom he shot and killed on Feb. 26.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police said Zimmerman called 911 and described Martin as &quot;suspicious.&quot; The two scuffled, and Trayvon wound up dead from a single bullet from Zimmerman's licensed 9mm semiautomatic, authorities say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The guy on the bottom, who I believe had a red sweater on, was yelling to me, 'Help, help.' I told him to stop, I was calling 911,&quot; John told the TV station. Zimmerman was wearing red.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;When I got upstairs and looked down, the person that was on top beating up the other guy was laying in the grass. And I believe he was dead at that point,&quot; the eyewitness claimed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman has claimed he acted in self-defense, though he was the one following Trayvon. He has not been charged and has been in hiding since the shooting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trayvon's friends have said the teen was not violent and they could never imagine him getting into a fight.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman's family said race had nothing to do with the incident.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Unfortunately, some individuals and organizations have used this tragedy to further their own causes and agendas,&quot; Zimmerman's father, George, a retired judge, wrote in the Orlando Sentinel.  </SPAN></P>
