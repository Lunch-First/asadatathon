<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 25--The images are so stark, all those people wearing hoodies in pictures for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Former Gov. Jennifer Granholm. The Miami Heat. Random friends and neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're all trying to bring badly needed attention to a face-slapping injustice: A white man kills an innocent black teen he unnecessarily feared in an Orlando suburb, and police and prosecutors won't even take the shooter into custody, much less charge him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I get it. I'm angry, too. And scared for kids like my son, who'll be a teenager soon enough -- and seen as a threat by some people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I'm also wondering: What have we done for Delric? Or Kade'jah? Or Je'Rean?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were black kids, too. They were innocent. And they were killed for stupid, stupid reasons right here in Detroit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it because their killings had nothing to do with racism that their deaths didn't evoke such passion or spark nationwide social media campaigns?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does combatting racial stereotypes -- which is about fighting one of the black community's external foes -- command an easier mental and emotional response than confronting the demons that exist between and among African Americans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me be clear here: I'm not trying to let anyone off the hook in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's outrageous that George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, got out of his vehicle when he saw Trayvon walking through his gated Sanford community, confronted the teen and then shot him after a scuffle. That's not any kind of neighborhood watch I've ever heard of -- it's barbarous vigilantism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But every day in this country, a black teen or child gets gunned down in encounters that are at least as perplexing. It has become so common, it's nauseating. And far more typically, the perpetrators are other African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delric Miller IV was a 9-month-old, sleeping on the couch in a home on Detroit's west side, when someone fired 37 rounds from an automatic weapon through the windows and walls, killing him instantly. His grandmother said she believes the attack was retaliation for a fight over chairs at a baby shower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve-year-old Kade'jah Davis was killed when someone fired shots through the front door of her home, supposedly by a man who had argued with her mother over a cell phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Je'Rean Blake was a 17-year-old standing on a corner on the city's east side, talking to a girl, when a man on a moped took exception to the look on his face. The man returned to the corner with a gun and shot twice into a crowd where Je'Rean was standing, killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These deaths were beyond senseless. And they happen all the time -- in Detroit and in other communities, big and small.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They don't raise the same kinds of questions as Trayvon's killing, questions about how virulent racial stereotypes still are in some quarters, or about how easily authorities brush off cold-blooded murder when a black kid is the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I think they raise far more serious questions about how we, as African Americans, deal with one another, how we value life and manage disputes, and how far we've allowed our communities to sink into moral chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've got everyone donning a hoodie to bring justice to Trayvon's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for the most part, when it's just another black kid killed by other black people, the emotions aren't nearly as raw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are, of course, bold exceptions. My friend Raphael Johnson, who heads the Detroit 300 neighborhood anti-crime group (which some worry is veering into vigilantism, too) works tirelessly to bring attention to the routine debasing of life in poor, black areas. So do lots of other people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they work in relative obscurity compared to the attention being garnered by Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death. It seems they can't get Americans of any hue as exercised about what they see every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family deserves justice, and that justice will mean something huge for a nation that still can't get race relations right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when that's done, it's worth asking when the far more common killings of black children will generate as much outrage and deserve as much attention.</SPAN></P>
