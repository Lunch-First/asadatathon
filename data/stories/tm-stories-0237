<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama may be the first black president but he doesn't like to talk about it much. This reluctance to address America's deep racial divisions, from a man who knows that he is a lasting symbol of civil rights progress, is viewed by some as an act of political cowardice, a narrow calculation designed to secure re-election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of civil rights leaders and black writers have spent the past month calling on the White House to condemn the Florida police department investigating the death of Trayvon Martin, below. When Mr Obama finally broke his silence on the issue yesterday it was typically non-confrontational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight months before his bid for re-election he used the emotive words of a parent, rather than a president, to deliver a delicately balanced political pitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama must convince America's sceptical working-class white voters to give him another chance. Divisive arguments over race are unlikely to help his cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the months after Mr Obama's inauguration he spoke out in defence of a black professor who was arrested at Harvard. The response was ferocious, prolonged and soon elicited a presidential retreat. He has since almost completely avoided entanglement in the thorny politics of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African-American critics want him to do more, saying that deep prejudices remain across America. &quot;The police view the black population as criminals,&quot; said Jumaane Williams, a New York City council member who was arrested on the street last year while wearing his council badge.</SPAN></P>
