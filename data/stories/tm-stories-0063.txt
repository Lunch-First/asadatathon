WASHINGTON: Members of the New Black Panther Party are offering a $US10,000 ($A9660) reward for the capture of George Zimmerman, the Neighbourhood Watch volunteer who shot dead teenager TrayvonMartin.
New Black Panther leader Mikhail Muhammad announced the reward during a protest in Sanford, Florida, on Saturday. And when asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly: ``An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.''
The bounty announcement came after members of the group called for the mobilisation of 10,000 black men to capture Zimmerman, who shot Martin in a gated Sanford community on February 26. Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland, where the 28-year-old worked before the shooting, employees there told The Orlando Sentinel.
Sanford city officials issued a statement late on Saturday, condemning the group's appeal and asking citizens to leave all arrests to the police.
``The city is requesting calm heads and no vigilante justice,'' the statement said. ``Attempts by civilians to take any person into custody may result in criminal charges or unnecessary violence.''
Former Orange-Osceola County prosecutor Esther Whitehead said the Panthers' bounty opened them up to civil and criminal liability.
``I can't see how anyone can go out and take action as a private citizen without some government action like the issuance of a warrant,'' she said. ``It doesn't make sense. It doesn't sound reasonable.''
The New Black Panthers were in Sanford on Saturday for the group's third protest in the past two weeks over the fatal shooting of the Miami Gardens teen.
Muhammed led the small group in chanting ``Justice for Trayvon!'' and ``Black Power!'' ``If the government won't do the job, we'll do it,'' he said, leading his group of eight party members in chants like ``freedom or death'' and ``justice for Trayvon'' while making the iconic gesture of raising their fists into the air.
Pastor Moses Brown, of Tampa, said he was disappointed with the New Black Panthers' approach.
``We believe in a message of justice, not hate,'' said Brown, who was in town to pray at the memorial. ``We believe justice will come through the court system.''
