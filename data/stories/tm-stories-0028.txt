Members of the New Black Panther Party are offering a US$10,000 reward for the "capture" of George Zimmerman, the Neighbourhood Watch volunteer who shot Trayvon Martin. New Black Panther leader Mikhail Muhammad announced the reward during a protest in Sanford, Florida, yesterday. And when asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly: "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."The bounty announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilisation of 10,000 black men to capture Zimmerman.
