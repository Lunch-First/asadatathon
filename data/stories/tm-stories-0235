<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 24--TAMPA -- Word about the rally for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin didn't come from the church pulpit on a Sunday, but via Facebook and Twitter on a Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no Bull Connor or biting police dogs or fire hoses spraying the peaceful crowd of hundreds as it marched down a sidewalk along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in northwest Tampa on Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things have changed since the 1960s, said Orlando Davis, a morning radio personality with 94.1 FM, as he stood on a podium at the rallying point and addressed the crowd. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unarmed young black man was gunned down. Mostly black marchers, shouting the decades-old chant, &quot;No justice, no peace,&quot; demanded answers to why the white shooter, a neighborhood watch captain named George Zimmerman, had not been charged with a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis, speaking into a microphone, said that while watching CNN he heard Zimmerman's attorney say, &quot;Zimmerman was not claiming a stand your ground defense. ... He said he was attacked by Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Davis spoke, some of those who gathered shouted, &quot;Lies, lies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And though the Feb. 26 killing in Sanford has taken on racial overtones, Davis tried to play that down. He pointed out everyone &quot;has hoodies in your closet&quot; similar to the one Martin was wearing the night he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a black issue,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not a white issue. It is a young issue. A right issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally was organized through a Facebook page for a group called &quot;Real Talk: Real Answers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It [the Facebook page] was started about a year ago by a group of friends as a way to vent about issues,&quot; said Nina Range, 31, from Tampa, who organized the rally and began spreading the word through social media Wednesday night, then with press releases to traditional media the following day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wearing a black hoodie and dark sunglasses, Range said the Facebook forum gives members a way to talk about politics, religion and current events. Watching coverage of Martin's shooting, she said she decided to do something to bring awareness of the issue to the Tampa Bay area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police estimate between 600 and 800 people marched. For many of them, Martin's killing was felt on a personal, visceral level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was a bad shooting,&quot; said Steeve A. Jocelyn, 28, of Tampa, as he marched through Al Lopez Park carrying the hoodie-clad 3-year-old son of a friend on his shoulders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jocelyn said his conclusion, based on media reports that Zimmerman shot Martin after chasing him, was the result of experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a cop,&quot; he said, explaining he is an Air Force Reserve senior airman and member of the 927 Aerial Refueling Wing security force squadron. &quot;The 'Stand Your Ground' law is about defending yourself. But you have to be standing, not chasing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though it became increasingly hot as the march made its way from the park to the rallying point, Shirley Copeland, 59, said she wouldn't take off the black hoodie she was wearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't care if it's hot,&quot; said Copeland, holding a sign reading, &quot;I Am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am wearing this hoodie,&quot; Copeland said. &quot;My children wear hoodies. Wearing a hoodie doesn't mean you are a criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Martin was shot, he was wearing a hoodie, carrying an iced tea and a bag of Skittles candy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those factors resonated with a pre-teen who had the same last name but was not related. Holding up a sign with checkmarks for &quot;iced tea,&quot; &quot;Skittles,&quot; &quot;hoodie,&quot; &quot;black&quot; and the words &quot;Am I Next?&quot; Zion Martin, 11, said he could identify with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And for more than sharing a last name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am young and black,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin also has intimate knowledge of what the slain teen's family might be feeling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I was three years old, my dad was shot and killed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother, LaTonya Martin, said her son's father was killed Aug. 23, 2004, in New York while attending a friend's funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one has been arrested for killing my dad,&quot; Zion Martin said. &quot;I am waiting for justice, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
