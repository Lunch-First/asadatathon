<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 25--Black women from the grass roots to the highest branches of Virginia government gathered in a high school auditorium to honor the sisters whose shoulders have provided a boost to them and the Richmond community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Celebrating African-American Women Achievers,&quot; the ninth annual Heritage Celebration, was a living-history lesson, a forum for contemporary issues and a cultural feast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Honored Saturday at Franklin Military Academy in Richmond's East End were retired Richmond schools Superintendent Lucille M. Brown; Richmond City Council Vice President Ellen F. Robertson; Church Hill civic leader Mary Thompson; Angela Patton, whose Camp Diva seeks to empower at-risk African-American girls; and Grace E. Harris, a retired Virginia Commonwealth University provost and vice president who twice served as acting president of the school that once denied her admission because of her race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are phenomenal. They have gone beyond the call of duty,&quot; said Del. Delores L. McQuinn, D-Richmond, who hosted the event with Councilwoman Cynthia I. Newbille.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The five honorees this afternoon, these are tremendous shoulders to stand on,&quot; Newbille said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The afternoon featured an array of cultural events, from African drums and dance to the spoken word to a theatrical production by Theatre IV. That play, &quot;The Oliver Hill Story,&quot; is based on the meeting of the civil rights lawyer and young Barbara Johns of Prince Edward County, who led more than 400 students at all-black Moton High School in the 1951 strike that resulted in a lawsuit that became part of the Supreme Court decision striking down the doctrine of &quot;separate but equal&quot; education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event's keynote speaker was Sulayman Clark, a university administrator and consultant whose historical novel &quot;The Rains&quot; is based on hundreds of scrapbooks discovered at Cheyney (Pa.) University containing newspaper clippings between 1850 and 1910.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The creator of the scrapbooks, Philadelphian William H. Dorsey, was part of a group of African-Americans who shared a sense of responsibility for preserving black history and achievement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was more than a hobby to these people. It was a sacred mission,&quot; Clark said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Clark, given the past-as-prologue undercurrent, ended his talk on a contemporary note. He said he had woken up in the middle of the night thinking of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot to death by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., while walking from a convenience store with snacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a heartbreaking story,&quot; Clark said. &quot;We can't bring Trayvon back. We know that. But history will record ... that just about a month has passed, and there's been no arrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called the episode &quot;a teachable moment&quot; and said Martin's death cannot be in vain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is history in the making,&quot; he said, &quot;and Lord knows, it can't end where it is now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
