<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- With a single punch, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin decked the neighborhood watch volunteer who eventually shot to death the unarmed 17-year-old, then Trayvon climbed on top of George Zimmerman and slammed his head into the sidewalk several times, leaving him bloody and battered, authorities have revealed to The Orlando Sentinel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the account Zimmerman gave police, and much of it has been corroborated by witnesses, authorities say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has not spoken publicly about what happened, but that night, Feb. 26, and in later meetings he described and re-enacted for police what he says happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his version of events, he had turned around and was walking back to his SUV when Trayvon approached him from behind, the two exchanged words then Trayvon punched him in the nose, sending him to the ground, and began beating him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told police he shot the teenager in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders and thousands of others have demanded Zimmerman's arrest, calling Trayvon a victim of racial profiling and Zimmerman a vigilante.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was an unarmed black teenager who had committed no crime, they say, who was gunned down while walking back from a 7-Eleven with nothing more sinister than a package of Skittles and can of Arizona iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters have held rallies in Sanford, Miami, New York and Tallahassee, calling the case a tragic miscarriage of injustice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton headlined a rally in Sanford Thursday that drew an estimated 8,000 people. The Rev. Jesse Jackson Sunday spoke at an Eatonville, Fla., church, where he called Trayvon a martyr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has gone into hiding. A fringe group, the New Black Panthers, have offered a $10,000 reward for his capture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have been reluctant to provided details about all their evidence, but this is what they've disclosed to the Sentinel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was on his way to the grocery store when he spotted Trayvon walking through his gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was visiting his father's fiancee, who lived there. He had been suspended from school in Miami after being found with an empty marijuana baggie. Miami schools have a zero-tolerance policy for drug possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman called police and reported a suspicious person, describing Trayvon as black, acting strangely and perhaps on drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman got out of his SUV to follow Trayvon on foot. When a dispatch employee asked Zimmerman if he was following the 17-year-old, Zimmerman said yes. The dispatcher told Zimmerman he did not need to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is about a one-minute gap during which police say they're not sure what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told them he lost sight of Trayvon and was walking back to his SUV when Trayvon approached him from the left rear, and they exchanged words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon asked Zimmerman if he had a problem. Zimmerman said no and reached for his cell phone, he told police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon then said, &quot;Well, you do now&quot; or something similar and punched Zimmerman in the nose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman fell to the ground and Trayvon got on top of him and began slamming his head into the sidewalk, he told police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman began yelling for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several witnesses heard those cries, and there has been a dispute about from whom they came: Zimmerman or Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for Trayvon's family say it was Trayvon, but police say their evidence indicates it was Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One witness, who has since talked to local television news reporters, told police he saw Zimmerman on the ground with Trayvon on top, pounding him and was unequivocal that it was Zimmerman who was crying for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman then shot Trayvon once in the chest from very close range, according to authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police arrived less than two minutes later, Zimmerman was bleeding from the nose, had a swollen lip and had bloody lacerations to the back of his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paramedics gave him first aid, but he said no to going to the hospital. He got medical care the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Justice last week opened a civil rights investigation into what happened, and Florida Gov. Rick Scott appointed a special prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not clear whether the special prosecutor, Angela Corey, the state attorney for Duval, Clay and Nassau counties, will have Zimmerman arrested, announce that there's not enough evidence to file a manslaughter charge or present evidence to a grand jury.</SPAN></P>
