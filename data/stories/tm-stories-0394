<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A neighbourhood watch co-ordinator who shot dead an unarmed black teenager and escaped arrest under a controversial self-defence law is to face investigation in a case that has provoked outrage across America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 28, claimed self-defence after shooting 17-yearold Trayvon Martin in the Florida town of Sanford. The state has some of the most relaxed self-defence laws in the country, and police apparently took Zimmerman at his word when he said he feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police failed to talk to Trayvon's 16-year-old girlfriend, who came forward to say that she was speaking on the telephone to him moments before the shooting, and heard him say he was being followed and was frightened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told him to run, but instead heard Zimmerman challenge Trayvon, who had been to a nearby 7-Eleven shop to buy a packet of Skittles sweets for his younger brother, asking his name and to explain what he was doing in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black public figures and members of Congress have led a national campaign calling for Zimmerman's arrest and Trayvon's family say the shooting on Feb. 26 would have been investigated further had the victim been white.</SPAN></P>
