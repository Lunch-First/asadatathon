<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pastor T.D. Hicks stood in front of his congregation Sunday morning wearing white sneakers, jeans and a black hooded sweatshirt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From his pulpit at Antioch Baptist Church, Hicks smiled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today it does my heart good to see you in your hoodies,&quot; Hicks announced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's service wasn't a casual church service but part of a solidarity movement suggested by their minister to support Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family, more than half of the people at the church's two services had people wearing hoodies.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old Florida high school student, was killed in Sanford, Fla., a community north of Orlando, on Feb. 26 while wearing a hooded sweatshirt. Former Topeka city manager Norton Bonaparte is the city manager in Sanford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locally, hoodies came into the spotlight when Topeka Police Chief Ron Miller in February suggested crime could be deterred by making people remove their hoods before entering a business. Topeka Mayor Bill Bunten said he wanted discussion on the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around the country there have been groups protesting the death of Martin by wearing hooded sweatshirts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hicks said he hoped that wearing the sweatshirts would bring more awareness to the incident that happened in Sanford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a black or a white issue - this is an issue of injustice,&quot; Hicks said. &quot;It is up to us as the body of Christ as believers and humans to say that one needs to take stand up for a wrong.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washburn student Phillip Watson, 21, felt that church was the right place to wear his blue hooded sweatshirt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Church is a place of healing and a place of outreach,&quot; Watson said. &quot;With something like this going on in this country, we should be active no matter where it is happening. I know some people here that went out and bought hoodies because they wanted to wear one today because it is that important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watson acknowledged that the clothes don't make the person, remembering when he was in high school and they banned do rags at Topeka West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you take something like that, you blow it up and make it taboo and perpetuate those stereotypes,&quot; Watson said. &quot;We don't need to perpetuate those stereotypes. It has nothing to do with who we are on the inside, and we don't need to judge people on what they are wearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesia Carter, 53, agreed while wearing her gray hooded sweatshirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that we are using the symbol of the hoodie doesn't have anything to do with clothes at all,&quot; Carter said. &quot;It brings attention to injustices. We need to see there are still things going on that we need to pay attention to and possibly change.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today wasn't the first time that Carter has worn a sweatshirt to church. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a come-as-you-are policy,&quot; Carter said. &quot;God doesn't look at what you are wearing, he looks at your heart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that we came together in unity to say something even though we are not anywhere close to where this tragedy happened,&quot; Carter said. &quot;What matters is that the world is coming together to say something needs to be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carter hopes that more light will shine on the issue locally and nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are talking about banning things, then we need to stop and see why people are wearing this and why they are taking a stance,&quot; Carter said. &quot;You have to listen, and then listening requires change. If you are going to listen, then that means that you are willing to do something about what I suggested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hicks told his congregation that all around the country pastors were asking their members to come together and pray for the family of Martin but he had a few amendments on that prayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They should also pray for Sanford city manager Norton Bonaparte, and the family of George Zimmerman, because all of their lives changed in an instant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One thing I know is that my neighbor is hurting and because my neighbor is hurting I should be hurting too,&quot; Hicks said. &quot;That's why we are here and praying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hicks said in between church services that he thought that wearing hoodies at church was a good idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the best things I saw today was one of our senior members had her hoodie on today in support and solidarity of what the church was doing,&quot; Hicks said. &quot;Often times support isn't voiced - sometimes you can just see it visibly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
