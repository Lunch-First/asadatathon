<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Town-watch volunteer George Zimmerman told Florida police he felt so threatened by a 17-year-old high schooler toting only a soft drink and a bag of Skittles that he had to gun him down.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As preposterous as that sounds, the self-defense claim carried enough weight with police in the Seminole County town of Sanford that Zimmerman, 28, has yet to be charged in the death of Trayvon Martin, a well-liked Miami teen with no criminal record. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's because Florida - like Pennsylvania, among nearly two-dozen other states - in recent years enacted a reckless law that gives citizens the right to use lethal force if they feel threatened. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, Zimmerman's story is unraveling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the welcome news late Monday that the U.S. Justice Department will open a civil-rights investigation - along with a Florida county grand jury probe - more and more troubling details of the Feb. 26 shooting of Martin are coming to light. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a 911 call in which Zimmerman was told by police to back off, rather than approach the teen he suspected of planning a break-in. He ignored the directive. Moments later, he shot Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the 911 recording, Zimmerman is heard to utter a racial epithet and express frustration that criminals &quot;always get away.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most damaging of all to Zimmerman's claim that he was attacked, without anyone as a witness, is a report that a clearly worried Martin phoned his girlfriend to tell her he was being stalked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full investigation that's warranted also must examine why Sanford police failed to test Zimmerman's sobriety. Was there racial bias in how police approached the case? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as this incident gets intense scrutiny, there's still all the self-defense statutes that could shield other reckless shooters. It's a problem that could come home to roost in any Pennsylvania community - especially in Philadelphia, where gun violence is epidemic in some neighborhoods. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While long recognized as a valid defense when someone is attacked inside his home, these expanded &quot;castle doctrine&quot; laws, as they're known, now cover virtually every setting. With states also being pushed by the National Rifle Association to loosen rules on carrying weapons, and gun owners emboldened by expanded self-defense rules, the risk for violent confrontations grows. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So a road-rage incident or tavern quarrel that might have led to a scuffle may now erupt in gunfire, with the last man standing claiming a right to shoot because he felt threatened. Even more perverse, drug dealers and other criminals settling scores can claim a legal right to replay the O.K. Corral. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Harrisburg, both Gov. Corbett and the majority-holding Republican lawmakers knew the risks when they expanded the state's &quot;castle&quot; doctrine last year. With the Florida case, they have more than enough evidence that the law should be repealed.    </SPAN></P>
