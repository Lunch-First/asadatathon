March 22--So far, Kansas has been fortunate to avoid an incident similar to the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida.
In that case, 28-year-old George Zimmerman followed an unarmed Martin, whom he described as "suspicious," through Zimmerman's gated community. Despite assurances from 911 officials that the police had been dispatched, Zimmerman continued his pursuit. The two got into a dispute after Martin removed his cell phone from his pocket, and Zimmerman fired a fatal shot into Martin's chest. 
And thanks to Florida's "stand your ground" law, Zimmerman so far hasn't been arrested or charged in the incident, although the case will be reviewed by a Florida grand jury.
Kansas law is similar to Florida's, stating that any person has the right to stand his ground at any place he has a right to be. Before legislators altered the law in 2010, it contained a "duty to retreat" provision, which required an initial attempt to leave a volatile situation before resorting to deadly force -- with an exception for a person's private property.
Local officials view Florida's case as a rarity and express little concern about the implications of Kansas law. Nevertheless, Kansas would do well to re-evaluate its own law to prevent a similar tragedy here.
The right to stand one's ground shouldn't extend to the right to pursue someone who hasn't committed a crime, nor should it give people the right to initiate a confrontation and hide behind the law to avoid prosecution.
Martin's death in Florida was inexcusable and completely unnecessary, and it was caused in part by a flawed law that allows people to determine what ground is theirs and a subjective interpretation of what is legally a legitimate threat.
