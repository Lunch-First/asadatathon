<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The parents of a Florida teen shot dead by a neighborhood watch captain vowed at a Union Square rally last night to seek justice for their son. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin did matter . . . We are not going to stop until we get justice for Trayvon,&quot; the teen's father, Tracy Martin, told a crowd of 1,200.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He described his 17-year-old son as &quot;your typical teenager . . . Trayvon was not, and I repeat, was not a bad person.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He lashed out at George Zimmerman, the 28-year-old aspiring law officer who claims he killed Trayvon in self defense while patrolling his gated community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;George Zimmerman took Trayvon's life for nothing,&quot; Martin said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Our son was not committing any crime,&quot; said Trayvon's mother, Sybrina Fulton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;This is not about a black-and-white thing. This is about right and wrong,&quot; she told the crowd. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trayvon carried no weapon, and died less than 100 yards from his father's home in Sanford, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many attending the &quot;Million Hoodie March&quot; wore hoodies just like the one Trayvon wore when he was shot dead on Feb. 26. Some also carried bags of Skittles, the candy Trayvon bought at a convenience store &shy;moments before his death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trayvon's parents didn't learn of the rally until after they arrived in New York for a round of media appearances. Some of the rally's organizers were &shy;affiliated with Occupy Wall Street. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because he claims Trayvon attacked him, Zimmerman has not been arrested or charged. Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law gives people the right to shoot instead of retreat if they feel they're in danger of &quot;death or great bodily harm.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last night, enraged demonstrators chanted &quot;We want arrests!&quot; during the march. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A grand jury in Florida will begin hearing the case next month.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Justice Department is also probing the shooting death. </SPAN></P>
