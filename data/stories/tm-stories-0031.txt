FLORIDA: Members of the New Black Panther Party are offering a $US10,000 ($A9660) reward for the ``capture'' of George Zimmerman, the Neighbourhood Watch volunteer who shot black youth TrayvonMartin.
Zimmerman - the man at the centre of the racially charged killing of the unarmed teen - is a former altar boy, insurance salesman and college student. Another label has also stuck in the public's perception: frustrated cop wannabe.
Over the years, his scores of calls to police showed he pursued shoplifters and errant drivers with zeal, reporting pitbulls, potholes, children playing in the street, open garage doors and ``suspicious'' youths, usually black males.
On the night of February 26, he tailed 17-year-old TrayvonMartin through the Retreat at Twin Lakes, the gated community where Zimmerman lived with his wife, describing his every move to a dispatcher who told him he didn't need to follow the young man.
A scuffle ensued and Zimmerman shot Trayvon dead. Zimmerman claimed it was in self-defence.
New Black Panther leader Mikhail Muhammad announced the reward during a protest in Sanford, Florida, on Saturday. When asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly: ``An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.''
The announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilisation of 10,000 men to capture Zimmerman.
Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman in Maitland, where the 28-year old worked before the shooting. He declined to say when the group would begin its search.
Sanford city officials condemned the group's appeal and asked citizens to leave arrests to police.
It was the New Black Panthers' third protest in the past two weeks over the fatal shooting of the Miami Gardens teen.
The group has consistently called for Zimmerman's arrest and threatened to find and detain him if police were not willing to do so.
