<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of students participated in a &quot;Hoodie Walk&quot; at Millersville University in Lancaster County Friday, seeking justice for 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. The Florida teen was walking home when he was gunned down by a neighborhood watchman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, Martin was wearing a hoodie and carrying a pack of skittles and an iced tea.  &quot;Hoodie Walk&quot; participants in an effort to show support followed suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wear hoodies all the time,&quot; said Saresa Williams, Millersville Junior.  &quot;This is a Millersville's hoodie. It could happen to anybody on campus, off-campus, anywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants walked from the Student Memorial Center, to the gym, and ended at the campus pond with a moment of silence and candle light vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is our brother,&quot; said Fen Alankus, Millersville Alum.  &quot;We don't know him. We don't know what he was thinking that day but we know he's one of us and that we care about him and we're here because we care about him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many students signed a petition that will be sent to Florida.  Students say they hope George Zimmerman, the man who killed Martin, will be brought to justice.   Zimmerman told police he shot Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
