<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA A local Facebook group is organizing a rally today in protest over officials' handling of the Trayvon Martin case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Real Talk: Real Answers,&quot; a group of about 100 members, says the peaceful rally at Al Lopez Park is in support of the Justice for Tray movement and is modeled after the recent &quot;Million Hoodie March&quot; in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group says the public is welcome and encourages protesters to wear hoodies, and bring posters and signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants will meet at 10:30 a.m. at the park, 4010 N. Himes Ave., then proceed at 11 a.m. to North Dale Mabry Highway at Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gathering is expected to last until 1 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstration is among several across the country related to Martin, a Miami Gardens 17-year-old who was fatally shot while walking to his father's Sanford home from a convenience store by a neighborhood watch volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting has sparked national outrage because no criminal charges have been filed against the shooter, George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
