<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US PRESIDENT Barack Obama pleaded for national ``soul-searching'' after 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot dead in a Florida gated community by a white Hispanic neighbourhood guard. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Obviously, this is a tragedy. I can only imagine what these parents are going through. And when I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,'' Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to 20,000 people demanding justice rallied late Thursday in the Florida town of Sanford, where Martin was killed by George Zimmerman late last month. Protesters have claimed that Martin's killing is just the last example of racial profiling and unjust treatment of blacks by the country's criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I think all of us have to do some soul-searching to figure out how does something like this happen. And that means that we examine the laws and the context for what happened,'' said Mr Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman hasn't been detained or charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI, the state attorney's office, Department of Justice and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement are investigating the case.</SPAN></P>
