March 25--CHICAGO -- Reverend Michael Pfleger of Saint Sabina Church urged parishioners to bring hooded sweatshirts, Skittles and cans of iced tea to mass on Sunday---the items that African-American Florida teenager TrayvonMartin was carrying when he was shot last month by a neighborhood watch volunteer. 
On Saturday several hundred people rallied at Daley Plaza, demanding justice for Trayvon, who was shot to death while walking to his father's house.
His killer, 28-year-old George Zimmerman, was never arrested or charged.
He claims the shooting was in self defense, and that therefore he is protected from prosecution by Florida's "stand your ground" laws.
Hoodies, Skittles and cans of iced tea have become symbols of support for Trayvon and his family.
Father Pfleger asked churches around the country to place the items atop their altars during Sunday mass.
