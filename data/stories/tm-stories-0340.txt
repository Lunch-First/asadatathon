The vigilante who allegedly shot Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager whose killing sparked outrage, called police to the gated community where he lived 46 times in the previous year, it emerged yesterday.
George Zimmerman, 28, repeatedly dialled 911 about what he regarded as "suspicious" individuals in the grounds of The Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sandford, Florida. Police did not arrest Mr Zimmerman when Mr Martin was shot, apparently accepting his claim that he'd acted in selfdefence.
Mr Martin, pictured, was not only far smaller than his killer, but was also unarmed. The US justice department has asked the FBI and civil rights department to review the case.
