<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Florida police chief who has been bitterly criticised for not arresting a neighborhood watch volunteer in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager temporarily stepped down yesterday, saying he had become a distraction to the investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee and his officers decided not to arrest George Zimmerman after he shot 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin to death on February 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was returning from a trip to a convenience store when Zimmerman started following him, telling police dispatchers he looked suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At some point, the two got into a fight and Zimmerman pulled out his gun. Zimmerman claims the shooting was self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told police 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin attacked him after he had given up on chasing the teenager and was returning to his sport utility vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting ignited racial tensions in this Orlando suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights groups have held rallies in Florida and New York, saying the shooting was unjustified. Yesterday, city commissioners gave the police chief a ``no confidence'' vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I must temporarily remove myself from the position as police chief for the city of Sanford. I do this in the hopes of restoring some semblance of calm to a city which has been in turmoil for several weeks,'' Lee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``It is my hope that the investigation will move forward swiftly and appropriately through the justice system.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief has said authorities were prohibited from making an arrest based on the facts and circumstances they had at the time of the shooting. He said he continued to stand behind his agency's investigation.</SPAN></P>
