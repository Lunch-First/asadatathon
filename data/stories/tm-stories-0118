<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Close to 1,000 people prayed, shouted and chanted during a downtown Jacksonville rally Saturday asking for criminal charges to be filed against the man who fatally shot teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Sanford last month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After walking from The Jacksonville Landing, the crowd gathered in the riverfront parking lot of the Duval County Courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were near the offices of State Attorney Angela Corey, whom Gov. Rick Scott assigned Thursday to investigate the killing as a special prosecutor, and much of their message was aimed at her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are looking at you. ... We expect you to do the right thing,&quot; Isaiah Rumlin, president of the Jacksonville branch NAACP said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Mia Jones, D-Jacksonville, told the crowd that &quot;in Jacksonville, this is a priority for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referencing Corey, she said that &quot;we need to show that we respect that she is hard on crime,&quot; Jones said. &quot;...&nbsp;We respect that she is for the victims. And the victim in this case is Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was shot by a volunteer in a neighborhood watch group while walking in a gated development. The volunteer, George Zimmerman, has argued he acted in self-defense after following Martin, although the teen was not armed and a police dispatcher had told Zimmerman not to follow him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was black. Zimmerman is Hispanic with a light complexion. People calling for Zimmerman's arrest argue he practiced a form of racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Benjamin Crump, who represents Martin's family, told the crowd they were part of a wave of demonstrations in Martin's memory by people of all races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a black or white thing. It's a right or wrong thing,&quot; he said during a light rain that scattered some demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the roll of speakers continued, participants held up signs including &quot;Americans Demand Justice&quot; and &quot;Trayvon was ran down and murdered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People expressed a range of concerns about public safety and race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are tired of 'just-us.' When people are arrested, it's always us,&quot; said Carolyn Walker, 73, who is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Foy, Jacksonville chapter president of the anti-crime group MAD DADS, said he was troubled to see a neighborhood watch effort invoked in defense of a shooting death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He overstepped his authority,&quot; Foy said of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linda Stacy, 65, who is white, said she identifies with Martin's family because she has grandchildren the same age and felt a need to speak against the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like if I don't do something to oppose it, I'm part of it,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
