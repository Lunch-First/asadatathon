<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free Speech: Some want &quot;hate speech&quot; measures silencing talk radio's voices of freedom. That would mean a chilling return to the left-leaning major media's monopoly on the flow of information. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On MSNBC last week, Democratic Party strategist Karen Finney blamed talk radio king Rush Limbaugh for the fatal shooting last month of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by a neighborhood watch captain in a mixed neighborhood in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limbaugh, along with Republican presidential candidates Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney, &quot;reinforce and validate old stereotypes that associate the poor and welfare as criminal behavior with African Americans and people of color, calling us lazy, undeserving recipients of public assistance,&quot; Finney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin incident, Finney claimed &quot;those festering stereotypes had lethal consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One might ask how Finney knows that Martin's half-Peruvian killer, George Zimmerman (whose photo suggests he's a person of color himself), listens to Limbaugh or has been affected by the candidates' speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in ex-Rep. Gabby Giffords' shooting last year, this is a case of a Democratic mouthpiece accusing foes of their big-government schemes of murder. So much for President Obama's call for civility in political discourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Finney is just one manifestation of a new war aiming to silence Limbaugh and like-minded talk radio hosts. After Limbaugh several weeks ago used rude words to describe a Georgetown law school feminist activist who wants taxpayers to finance her contraception, the Los Angeles city council last week entered the realm of government censorship of the airwaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 13-to-2 vote the L.A. City Council called on &quot;management of radio and television stations in Los Angeles to do everything in their power to ensure that their on-air hosts do not use and promote racist and sexist slurs over public airwaves in the City of Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the George Soros-funded Media Matters is spending a fortune on radio ads in Boston, Chicago and other cities to intimidate Limbaugh's advertisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who decides what's &quot;racist&quot; or &quot;sexist&quot;? The Gingrich comment Finney considered &quot;dangerous,&quot; for instance, described how liberal welfare policies hurt minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The left isn't targeting &quot;hate,&quot; but rather intellectual challenges to their big-government policies.</SPAN></P>
