In the past few weeks, hundreds of thousands of social media messages have spread the word about TrayvonMartin.
The black teen was shot to death Feb. 26 by neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Racial tensions have rapidly escalated as civil rights groups have held rallies, calling the shooting unjustified. 
Zimmerman claims self-defence, saying he shot after Martin attacked him. Zimmerman's father is white, and his mother is Peruvian.
U.S. President Barack Obama chose a personal way to weigh in on the case Friday.
"If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon," Obama said in Washington, adding that "every aspect" of the case should be investigated.
Martin was wearing the hood of his sweatshirt up, and Zimmerman told a police dispatcher he thought the 17-year-old looked suspicious.
On Facebook, some protesters are wearing hoodies in their profile photos with the caption, "Do I look suspicious?"
Miami Heat basketball players joined the conversation Friday with similar visual statements.
Dwyane Wade posted to his Facebook page a picture of himself wearing a hoodie. Later, LeBron James posted a picture on his Twitter account of the Heat team in hoodies, with the caption, "#WeAreTrayvonMartin #Hoodies #Stereotyped #WeWantJustice."
Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera had a different take on the hoodie debate, saying Friday that people who wear them are often going to be perceived as a menace and urging parents on Twitter to tell their kids not to wear them.
"I'll bet you money that if (Martin) didn't have that hoodie on, that nutty neighbourhood watch guy wouldn't have responded in that violent and aggressive way," Rivera said on Fox & Friends.
His comments drew an immediate backlash online.
