<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can people be pro-life and at the same time cater to the National Rifle Association and our archaic gun laws? How can 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla., be shot due to the misguided actions of a &quot;neighborhood watch&quot; person and there be no arrest or charges against the shooter? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do mentally ill people in Pittsburgh (shooting at UPMC's Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic) and at Virginia Tech get weapons so easily and do so much unnecessary killing? How do kids get guns to bring to school (in Ohio, in Colorado ...)? When will people of principle stand up to the National Rifle Association and demand sensible gun laws -- with consequences for those who hurt others? When will the issue of gun laws enter the arena of public discourse? How can politically motivated people want to strip the reproductive rights of women while at the same time allowing our totally loose gun laws to result in needless killing every day in this country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are the most uncivilized &quot;civilized&quot; country in the world today.</SPAN></P>
