<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NEW Black Panther Party offered a bounty of $10,000 Saturday for the &quot;capture&quot; of a Florida neighborhood watch captain who killed unarmed teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,&quot; leader Mikhail Muhammad said after announcing the reward for George Zimmerman at a protest in Sanford, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad called on 5,000 black men to mobilize and capture the neighborhood watch volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the government won't do the job, we'll do it,&quot; Muhammad said, leading chants that included &quot;freedom or death&quot; and &quot;justice for Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New Black Panther spokesman said the group is hoping to collect $1 million from outraged supporters to set up its own &quot;ministry of defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just as some neighborhoods have a neighborhood watch, we believe that we have to have our own neighborhood watch in the black community in order to protect ourselves,&quot; spokesman Chawn Kweli told the Daily News. New Black Panthers members pointed to what they called the inaction of government officials - from Sanford city officials up to the governor - and accused them of lying and delaying justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also said Angela Corley, the newly appointed special prosecutor, was an enemy of the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She has a track record of sending innocent young black men and women to prison,&quot; Muhammad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Southern Poverty Law Center calls the New Black Panther Party, a black-separatist group created in 1989, &quot;virulently racist and anti-Semitic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, a 17-year-old African-American, was wearing a hoodie and carrying a pack of Skittles and an ice tea on the night of Feb. 26. He was heading back to his father's fianc&eacute;'s townhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 28, called 911 to report a suspicious person in the gated community and followed the teen despite the dispatcher's request that he stand down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman said he shot Martin in self-defense. Zimmerman's family says he is Hispanic and race was not an issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida man was also charged Friday with threatening to kill Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee and his family. Lee temporarily stepped down as chief over the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's mom said she was having a hard time realizing that her son's not coming home, People magazine reported Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I look at every door and think, he's just going to walk through it any minute,&quot; Sybrina Fulton said. tmoore@nydailynews.com</SPAN></P>
