<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - Fox News Channel commentator Geraldo Rivera said Friday that the hoodie an unarmed black teenager wore when he was killed in Florida is as much responsible for his death as the man who shot him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The veteran TV personality, speaking on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends,&quot; waded in with an opinion on the shooting of Trayvon Martin. He later acknowledged that his comments were &quot;politically incorrect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People wearing hooded sweatshirts are often going to be perceived as a menace, Rivera said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll bet you money that if he didn't have that hoodie on, that nutty neighborhood watch guy wouldn't have responded in that violent and aggressive way,&quot; Rivera said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of Martin, Rivera said, &quot;God bless him, he was an innocent kid, a wonderful kid.&quot; But he said the case should be a warning to parents to watch what their children should wear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you dress like a hoodlum eventually some schmuck is going to take you at your word,&quot; he wrote in a commentary posted Friday on the website Fox News Latino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of people had posted messages on Rivera's Facebook page by Friday afternoon, the overwhelming majority of them negative about Rivera's comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one black, brown or white can honestly tell me that seeing a kid of color with a hood pulled over his head doesn't generate a certain reaction - sometimes scorn, often menace,&quot; Rivera wrote in his commentary.</SPAN></P>
