<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Obama celebrated an extended St. Patrick's Day at the White House on Tuesday with a visit from Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, who assured Obama that his debt-ridden nation would make an economic comeback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in the Oval Office alongside the Irish leader, Obama expressed his confidence in Kenny's government, saying he believed that it would be able &quot;to get Ireland moving again.&quot; He said the two leaders also discussed the larger issue of European growth, which Obama said would have a positive impact on the U.S. economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously for both our countries, one of the biggest priorities is getting the economy moving in the right direction and putting our people back to work,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenny said that there are &quot;signs of confidence&quot; emerging from the Irish economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Irish are struggling to reverse 14.4 percent unemployment, slow a renewed wave of emigration and rebuild a battered credit rating.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- An unarmed black teenager shot to death by a neighborhood watch captain told his girlfriend moments before he was killed that he was being followed, a lawyer said Tuesday as federal and state prosecutors announced they would investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, he's right behind me; he's right behind me again,&quot; Trayvon Martin, 17, told his girlfriend on his cellphone, the Martin family's attorney said. The girl later heard Martin say, &quot;Why are you following me?&quot; Another man asked, &quot; 'What are you doing around here?' &quot; attorney Benjamin Crump said. The phone call was disclosed as the U.S. Justice Department opened a federal civil rights probe into the Feb. 26 shooting and the local prosecutor convened a grand jury to investigate. The neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, has not been charged, and said he shot Martin, who was returning to a gated community in Sanford after buying candy at a convenience store, in self-defense. At a town hall-style meeting Tuesday night, more than 350 people packed into the sanctuary of the Allen Chapel AME Church.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airport to be renamed in honor of Clintons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Airport officials in Little Rock, Ark., voted unanimously Tuesday to rename Little Rock National Airport in honor of former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, a rare twin billing for the state's former first couple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change won't be official until the Federal Aviation Administration signs off. Adams Field, the designation for the airport's aeronautical operations, will remain the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill and Hillary Clinton not only devoted years of service to Arkansas, but have served the nation as a two-term president, and as first lady, U.S. senator, and secretary of state -- that's a legacy of which all Arkansans can be proud,&quot; said Jim Dailey, chairman of the Little Rock Municipal Airport Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe renaming our airport in their honor is a fitting way to recognize their service and their position in Arkansas and our nation's history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Clinton, who served six terms as governor, released a statement saying he and his wife &quot;are humbled&quot; by the decision.</SPAN></P>
