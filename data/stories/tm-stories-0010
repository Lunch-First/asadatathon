<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of Americans have rallied in cities across the country to protest the shooting death last month of an unarmed Florida teenager, in a case that has struck a nerve in a country still plagued by racial divisions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dressed in black &quot;hoodie&quot; sweatshirts like the one Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was wearing when he was shot, and chanting &quot;no justice, no peace,&quot; protesters in cities including Washington DC, Chicago, Tampa and Nashville on Saturday demanded justice in a case that many feel demonstrates lingering racism in American law and society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington DC, as many as 2000 people came to the steps of the mayor's office for a rally hastily organised over Twitter and Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager at the heart of the protests was Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, an African-American who was killed February 26 in Sanford, a suburb of Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His apparent killer, George Zimmerman, 28, is white and reportedly of Latino descent. He was a neighbourhood security patrol volunteer who was carrying a legal weapon. He reportedly used a racial epithet in a recorded call to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford police said an initial investigation did not find enough evidence to arrest Zimmerman, who claimed to have acted in self-defence. A grand jury will decide April 10 whether to charge Zimmerman with murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday's rallies continued several days of protests that started with a &quot;million-hoodie march&quot; in New York and Miami March 21.</SPAN></P>
