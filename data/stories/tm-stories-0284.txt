The shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin is an illustration of how dangerous badly drafted laws can be.
The death of the unarmed 17 year old, shot by a self-appointed neighbourhood-watch volunteer, has prompted demands that the shooter to be arrested. Under Florida's controversial "stand your ground" law, that is likely not possible. The law says people have the right to use deadly force if they "reasonably" believe they or another person are threatened with death or serious harm. Zimmerman was detained but released by police who say they believed his account that Martin started the scuffle and that he fired in self defence. Under the law, there is no need to prove imminent danger or the need to use deadly force. 
In Canada, we have had our own self defence debate in recent years. The result is a streamlined law that gives those acting in self-defence more leeway and should avoid future cases such as that of Toronto shopkeeper David Chen who was charged with assault and forcible confinement after tying up a man who had stolen some plants. Clarifying archaic laws is a good thing, but giving vigilantes power to take the law into their hands is not.
