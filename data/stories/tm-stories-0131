<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am a Carlow student taking a class called the Youth Media Advocacy Program. Our groups go into different Pittsburgh Public schools to work with students on being empowered, fighting for issues that are important to them and raising awareness. We tell the youth to stand up for their rights and stick up for each other. We encourage them to question authority and be leaders in their communities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Trayvon Martin encountered George Zimmerman, Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law was used against Trayvon to justify his killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tony Norman's column &quot;Trayvon Martin and a Vigilante's Deadly Zeal&quot; (March 20), there were two comments that I have to quote. The first is, &quot;Unless the legal standard now is that black youth have to show fearful deference to random strangers who stop them on streets they have a legal right to be, then Mr. Zimmerman's actions weren't justified.&quot; Mr. Norman's second short but sweet sentiment states that, &quot;All sorts of murderous mischief would be possible if the only threshold for killing is fear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman should be behind bars instead of hiding behind a gun and a law that allows lawlessness.</SPAN></P>
