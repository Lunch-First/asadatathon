<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, join in a march in New York on Wednesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - The parents of a black teenager shot to death by a Hispanic neighborhood watch captain in Florida told hundreds of people at a march in his memory on Wednesday that they won't stop until they get justice for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My son did not deserve to die,&quot; the teenager's father, Tracy Martin, said after thanking the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Martin's son, 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, was killed Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla. He was returning to a gated community in the city after buying candy at a convenience store. He was unarmed and was wearing a hooded sweatshirt, called a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, has not been charged in the shooting. Zimmerman has said Martin attacked him and he shot the teen in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Wednesday night, demonstrators chanted &quot;we want arrests&quot; during the Million Hoodie March in Manhattan's Union Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case has ignited a furor against the police department of the Orlando suburb of 53,500 people. Seminole County State Attorney Norm Wolfinger said a grand jury will meet April 10 to consider evidence in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;b&gt;HOUSE PANEL APPROVES NEW GOP BUDGET PLAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WASHINGTON&lt;/b&gt; - Republicans on a key House panel Wednesday muscled through a contentious GOP budget plan to sharply cut federal health care spending and safety-net programs like food stamps as the chief means to attack trillion-dollar-plus deficits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The House Budget Committee approved the GOP plan on a near party-line 19-18 vote, readying it for a House vote next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The GOP plan is nonbinding but calls for repealing President Barack Obama's health care law while transforming Medicare into a voucher-like system in which the government subsidizes purchases of health insurance on the private market instead of directly paying doctor and hospital bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;b&gt;MARINE FACES DISCIPLINE FOR POLITICAL STATEMENTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SAN DIEGO&lt;/b&gt; - The Marine Corps on Wednesday notified a sergeant who has been openly critical of President Barack Obama that he is violating Pentagon policy barring troops from political activities and that he faces dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Camp Pendleton Marine Sgt. Gary Stein started a Facebook page called Armed Forces Tea Party to encourage fellow service members to exercise their free speech rights. He declared a few weeks ago that he would not follow the unlawful orders of the commander in chief. Stein also criticized Defense Secretary Leon Panetta for his comments on Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stein, a nine-year member of the Corps, said he did nothing wrong and planned to fight the charges.</SPAN></P>
