<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON: Members of the New Black Panther Party are offering a $US10,000 ($A9660) reward for the capture of George Zimmerman, the Neighbourhood Watch volunteer who shot dead teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Black Panther leader Mikhail Muhammad announced the reward during a protest in Sanford, Florida, on Saturday. And when asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly: ``An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bounty announcement came after members of the group called for the mobilisation of 10,000 black men to capture Zimmerman, who shot Martin in a gated Sanford community on February 26. Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland, where the 28-year-old worked before the shooting, employees there told The Orlando Sentinel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford city officials issued a statement late on Saturday, condemning the group's appeal and asking citizens to leave all arrests to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The city is requesting calm heads and no vigilante justice,'' the statement said. ``Attempts by civilians to take any person into custody may result in criminal charges or unnecessary violence.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Orange-Osceola County prosecutor Esther Whitehead said the Panthers' bounty opened them up to civil and criminal liability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I can't see how anyone can go out and take action as a private citizen without some government action like the issuance of a warrant,'' she said. ``It doesn't make sense. It doesn't sound reasonable.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Black Panthers were in Sanford on Saturday for the group's third protest in the past two weeks over the fatal shooting of the Miami Gardens teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammed led the small group in chanting ``Justice for Trayvon!'' and ``Black Power!'' ``If the government won't do the job, we'll do it,'' he said, leading his group of eight party members in chants like ``freedom or death'' and ``justice for Trayvon'' while making the iconic gesture of raising their fists into the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pastor Moses Brown, of Tampa, said he was disappointed with the New Black Panthers' approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We believe in a message of justice, not hate,'' said Brown, who was in town to pray at the memorial. ``We believe justice will come through the court system.''</SPAN></P>
