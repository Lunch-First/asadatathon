<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 America The US Justice Department opened an investigation following widespread protests on Monday into the killing of an unarmed 17-year-old who was shot dead while walking home from a sweet shop in a suburb of Orlando, Florida. George Zimmerman, 28, a neighbourhood watch officer, claims he acted in self-defence when he gunned down Trayvon Martin. Under the state self-defence laws he cannot be prosecuted for murder. Witnesses, however, say they heard a boy pleading before two gunshots were fired. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's mother has argued her son was targeted because he was black. She said: &quot;My son wasn't doing anything but walking on the sidewalk.&quot; The police chief resigned on Thursday. The tragedy also prompted the state governor to call for a review of the law as it applies to self-defence.</SPAN></P>
