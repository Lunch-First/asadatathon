The father of a black teenager shot to death by a neighbourhood watch captain in Florida said he was "honoured" by a march being planned in New York in support of his son. 
"I feel very honoured that New York would do a rally in my son"s honor," Tracy Martin told The Associated Press, hours before what was being called the Million Hoodie March was supposed to take place.
Martin"s son, 17-year-old TrayvonMartin, was killed Feb. 26 after buying candy at a convenience store. He was unarmed and wearing a hooded sweat shirt at the time.
The shooter, George Zimmerman, has not been charged and has said he shot the teen in self-defence after Martin attacked him. Police said Zimmerman is white; his family says he is Hispanic.
The case has ignited a furor against the police department of the Orlando suburb, prompting rallies and a protest in Gov. Rick Scott"s office Tuesday. The US Justice Department has opened a civil rights probe into the shooting, and Seminole County State Attorney Norm Wolfinger said a grand jury will meet April 10 to consider evidence.
Martin said he and his son"s mother, Sybrina Fulton, found out about the march after arriving in New York, where they have done interviews about the situation. They contacted the organisers to say they would come and speak.
The timing is "incredible," said Daniel Maree, one of the organisers.
Tracy Martin said he was trying to stay strong.
"I don"t feel this is the time to break down, even though it"s a very troubling time in my life," he said. "I"ve told myself, when I get justice for Trayvon, then I"ll have my time to break down."
