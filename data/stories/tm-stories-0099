<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 26--NEW ORLEANS -- The president of the NAACP in New Orleans, Danatus King, is concerned about what could follow the online comments of an NOPD officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That has a potential to set off something in this city that could be disastrous to all of us,&quot; King said while at his office Monday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About an hour before King expressed his concerns, NOPD Superintendent Ronal Serpas told reporters that he was suspending indefinitely Officer Jason Giroir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do know that these are his statements, and that's unrefuted,&quot; Serpas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments from both men stem from the killing of a Florida teenager, Trayvon Martin. The killing has sparked outrage around the country, although so far the neighborhood watch captain who shot him remains uncharged. Around the country, including the New Orleans area, people are gathering to remember Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WWL-TV in New Orleans aired a story on one such gathering over the weekend and posted the story on the web. A couple of comments allegedly came from Giroir and said that Martin lived like a thug and died like a thug. When another blogger posted a comment critical of Giroir's, he appears to respond, &quot;...come on down to our town with a hoodie and you can join Martin in hell...&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giroir made headlines earlier this month when he was involved in a shootout that left one suspect dead and two officers in the hospital. Now, the NAACP doubts the credibility of the officer. King is worried the latest blogging comments could spark unrest during what should be a proud time for the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have the Final Four that's coming to town. And no telling what's going to happen with this tinder box that's been set off,&quot; Kind said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm asking the community not to let the comments of one officer stand in the way of the great work that we have done together,&quot; Serpas said.</SPAN></P>
