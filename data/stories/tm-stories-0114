<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. - Members of the New Black Panther Party are offering a $10,000 reward for the &quot;capture&quot; of George Zimmerman, leader Mikhail Muhammad announced during a protest in Sanford Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly saying: &quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bounty announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilization of 5,000 black men to capture George Zimmerman, the Neighborhood Watch volunteer who shot Trayvon Martin last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland and Jacksonville - where the 28-year-old worked before the shooting, employees there told the Orlando Sentinel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad said the group's national chairman, Dr. Malik Zulu Shabaz of Washington, D.C., is receiving donations from black entertainers and athletes. They hope to collect $1 million, Muhammad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group called for Zimmerman's arrest and threatened to find and detain him if police were not willing to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party members said they are tired of the inaction of government officials - from Sanford city officials up to the governor, accusing them of lying and delaying justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Southern Poverty Law Center says the New Black Panther Party is &quot;virulently racist and anti-Semitic,&quot; and its leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews and law officers.</SPAN></P>
