<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York has among the country's strictest gun control laws to prevent deaths like that of Trayvon Martin. Pistol-packing America will just have to get used to it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gun advocates have been howling that city police recently busted a few otherwise law-abiding visitors who traveled here with their weapons. It just seemed normal to them to walk crowded streets with loaded and concealed guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uh-uh. Not here. Not when New Yorkers surrender their weapons for the good of all or face jail time. Herewith, then, kudos to Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance for prosecuting medical student Meredith Graves of Tennessee and jeweler Ryan Jerome of Indiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerome inquired about checking his pistol at the Empire State Building in September. Busted. Graves did the same thing at the 9/11 Memorial in December. Busted. Jerome became a mini-cause celebre when supporters called for dismissing charges because he was said to be a former Marine with a distinguished record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Jerome's service history left something to be desired. He stayed in uniform less than 11 months, went absent without leave, admitted using pot and got an &quot;other than honorable&quot; discharge by a summary court-martial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerome and Graves pleaded guilty to misdemeanors and were sent back to states where the right to own a gun can trump the right to live.</SPAN></P>
