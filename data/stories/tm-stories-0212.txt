US President Barack Obama has called the shooting dead of an innocent black teen in Florida a "tragedy". 
He spoke for the first time about the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, 17.
Mr Obama added if he had a son he would look like the gunned down youngster.
The killing of the unarmed teenager in Florida by a neighbourhood watch volunteer has caused outrage among the African American community.
The shooter, George Zimmerman, has insisted that he shot Trayvon in self defence and he has not been arrested.
Mr Obama said: "When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids, and I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this.
"I can only imagine what these parents are going through. You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon."
