<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SARASOTA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local attorneys who have successfully defended accused murderers using Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law say it is a good tactic for law-abiding citizens who are threatened, but would be misapplied in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, an unarmed black teenager, was killed Feb. 26 in a gated town house community in Sanford when he was shot by a crime watch volunteer as he walked home from a convenience store. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 28, reported a suspicious person to 911 and then followed Martin. Zimmerman, described as white Hispanic, has not been arrested. He told police he fired on Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in self-defense when the teenager attacked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradenton attorney Charlie Britt and Eric Reisinger of Sarasota have successfully defended clients using the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; defense, and both were surprised that Martin's accused shooter has not yet been charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, Britt had second-degree murder charges against his client, Edwin Vargas-Lopez, dropped after filing a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; immunity motion -- the first use of the 2005 statute in Manatee County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vargas-Lopez had been drinking and dancing at a club on Cortez Road. After he danced with a waitress, someone became jealous and struck him in the head. Vargas-Lopez struggled to his truck and shut the door, but several people punched him and tried to pull him out of the window, including 32-year-old Fernando Castulo Morales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vargas-Lopez grabbed a knife and swung with the weapon, striking Morales in the chest and killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britt argued his client was in fear for his life, and that he had a right to protect himself; the judge agreed. &quot;It worked out well for Edwin,&quot; Britt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida law allows a person who is &quot;not engaged in any unlawful activity&quot; to &quot;meet force with force,&quot; including the use of deadly force. It does not require a person to retreat if they are in a public place, a requirement of previous state laws, and therefore allows them to &quot;stand their ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a good law, and it should be the law,&quot; said Britt, a former law enforcement officer. &quot;If you're in a life-and-death situation, sometimes you have the opportunity to retreat, sometimes you don't. The law shouldn't require you to run if it would compromise your life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britt has another case pending in which his client may claim a defense under &quot;Stand Your Ground.&quot; The man fired several shots into the air to stop a crowd of people who were advancing on him, including some whom he believed were armed. No one was injured, but Britt's client was charged with unlawful discharge of a firearm. These charges, too, will likely be dismissed, Britt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that in a public place, you should be able to use deadly force,&quot; Britt said. &quot;The cops can use it. Why can't I?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, Sarasota's Reisinger had second-degree murder charges against his client, Alphonse Gallo, dropped due to this type of defense, the first time the law was used in Sarasota County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 2010, Gallo was confronted by three people he thought were going to rob him outside a Newtown bar, including Patrick Barbour, whom Gallo fought with earlier that evening. Gallo testified later that Barbour pulled out a firearm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gallo, who had a concealed weapon permit, produced his pistol and a firefight ensued. More than two dozen rounds were exchanged between Gallo, Barbour and Barbour's friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it was over, Barbour had been hit three times and later died. Reisinger filed a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; immunity motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The victim threatened to shoot my client. My client defended himself. The judge granted the motion for immunity,&quot; Reisinger said. &quot;For law-abiding citizens who aren't causing trouble, it's a good law. People have a right to defend themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Reisinger said he doesn't think the law applies. &quot;By all accounts, he instigated the altercation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britt also said it appears as though the accused shooter took the fight to Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know what happened,&quot; Britt said. &quot;He said the kid came at him. Who's going to dispute it? The kid's dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the country, more states are adopting similar statutes after recent decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court clarified a person's right to self-defense, said Delaware attorney John Sigler, past president of the National Rifle Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known as &quot;castle doctrines,&quot; the laws codify people's right to defend themselves in their home or &quot;castle.&quot; Florida had that law in place for years before enacting &quot;Stand Your Ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many states required people to retreat if confronted in their own home. That didn't make sense and the laws were changed,&quot; Sigler said. &quot;The next logical step is why should people be required to retreat anywhere, if they are there legally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This doctrine, however, may not apply in the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
