A March Against Violence is planned for 5 p.m. today, with marchers beginning at the corner of Jackson and 17th streets and continuing to Comiskey Park. 
The event is sponsored by J4BG Leadership Academy, a local program designed to develop childhood and adolescent leadership skills.
"We want to be able to engage the community about violence prevention," said Larry Jackson, Jr., of J4BG Leadership Academy.
Participants are asked to wear hooded sweatshirts in recognition of the Florida shooting of teenager Trayvon Martin.
Iowa law students have organized a vigil to honor Martin's life, as well as a rally opposing the state's "Stand Your Ground" legislation.
The state rally will be at 6 p.m. today at the Iowa Capitol in
Des Moines.
