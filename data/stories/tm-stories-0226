<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GOLF:&lt;/b&gt; Tiger Woods is in a place he hasn't been in 30 months - atop the leaderboard on the PGA Tour going into the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With alarming control, Woods putted for birdie on every hole and made short work of the par 5s Friday at Bay Hill for a 7-under-par 65, giving him a share of the lead with Charlie Wi after two rounds of the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Orlando, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wi rolled in a 25-foot birdie putt on his last hole for a 68 to join Woods at 10-under 134.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Pernice Jr. off to strong start at Fallen Oaks:&lt;/b&gt; In his first Champions Tour event this year, Tom Pernice Jr. was 7 under through 12 holes before play was suspended because of darkness at the Mississippi Gulf Resort Classic began play at Fallen Oaks in Saucier, Miss. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Tseng leads Kia Classic:&lt;/b&gt; Top-ranked Yani Tseng shot a 4-under 68 to open a two-stroke lead over Se Ri Pak after the second round of the LPGA's Kia Classic in Carlsbad, Calif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tseng, tied for the first-round lead after a 67, had a 9-under 135 total on La Costa's Legends Course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wendy Ward of Edwall, Wash., missed the cut by one stroke, closing the second round with a 74.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;b&gt;SHAW BEATS ASHLAND FOR NCAA D-II TITLE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WOMEN'S BASKETBALL:&lt;/b&gt; Sequoyah Griffin scored 24 points and Shaw (29-6) rallied to win its first national title, beating Ashland (33-2) 88-82 in overtime in the NCAA Division II championship game in San Antonio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;b&gt;HEAT ADD VOICES TO SHOOTING PROTEST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NBA:&lt;/b&gt; LeBron James and Dwyane Wade were among several Miami players who took the floor against the Detroit Pistons at Auburn Hills, Mich., with messages on their sneakers about the death of an unarmed black teenager who was shot by a neighborhood crime-watch volunteer in a suburb of Orlando, Fla. The Heat made quick work of the Pistons in an 88-73 victory, but the focus afterward was on the team's decision to speak out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miami also posed for a picture earlier in the day wearing team-logo hoodies. Trayvon Martin was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when he was shot last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As leaders, as role models, we're happy that we're able to shed light on a situation that we feel isn't right,&quot; James said. &quot;That's why we did that today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The game also marked the Heat debut of former Gonzaga University star Ronny Turiaf, who was with the Washington Wizards when he broke his hand in January and had not played since. The Wizards traded Turiaf last week to Denver, which waived him on Sunday. He then signed as a free agent with Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turiaf played 11 minutes and scored four points and grabbed four rebounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Sixers stay in first:&lt;/b&gt; Elton Brand scored 20 points, and Spencer Hawes had 12 points and 10 rebounds to help the 76ers remain in first place in the Atlantic Division with a 99-86 victory over the Boston Celtics in Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was a serious scare when Celtics guard Mickael Pietrus left on a stretcher and was to be hospitalized overnight after an awkward collision late in the first half. He was listed as having a &quot;closed head injury.&quot; No other details were available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Thunder survive Love's 51:&lt;/b&gt; Russell Westbrook scored 45 points, Kevin Durant added 40 points and a season-high 17 rebounds and the Oklahoma City Thunder overcame a career-high 51 points from Minnesota All-Star Kevin Love to beat the visiting Timberwolves 149-140 in double overtime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Lakers beat Trail Blazers:&lt;/b&gt; Andrew Bynum had 28 points and nine rebounds, point guard Ramon Sessions had 20 points and 11 assists in his first start for the Lakers, and host Los Angeles beat the Portland Trail Blazers 103-96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Hornets' Smith punished for foul on Griffin:&lt;/b&gt; Hornets forward Jason Smith was suspended two games for his hard foul Thursday on Los Angeles Clippers' star Blake Griffin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spencer Machacek scored his first NHL goal with 3:45 remaining in regulation to tie it, and the Jets went on to break a two-game losing streak and pull within four points of the final postseason spot in the Eastern Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &lt;b&gt;Oilers slip past Panthers in shootout:&lt;/b&gt; Ryan Nugent-Hopkins scored the deciding goal in the fourth round of a shootout to give the Edmonton Oilers a 2-1 victory over the Florida Panthers in Sunrise, Fla.</SPAN></P>
