Delayed, grudging justice Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African-American, has been dead for nearly one month, killed on February 26 in Sanford, Florida, by George Zimmerman. Mr Zimmerman is a heat-packing neighbourhood watch captain who frequently called police to report suspicious sightings of black boys in the gated community where he lived and patrolled. 
The state prosecutor in the Central Florida county that includes Sanford announced on Tuesday that a grand jury would convene next month - six weeks after the shooting. This grudging decision came only after Mr Martin's family members began to speak publicly about the disturbing circumstances of his death; only after 911 released recordings showed Mr Zimmerman stalking Mr Martin as the youth walked home with an iced tea and a bag of Skittles; and only after the Justice Department declared that it would step in to determine whether federal civil rights laws were broken.
Even now, with much of the country watching this sleepy outpost one hour north of Walt Disney World, there is reason to worry whether justice will be served.
This is an edited extract of an editorial published in The Washington Post on Wednesday.
