<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI The U.S. Justice Department could bring a hate- crime charge against the shooter in the killing of black Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin if there is sufficient evidence that the slaying was motivated by racial bias, legal experts and former prosecutors say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, only one such clue has surfaced publicly against 28-year-old George Zimmerman, the neighborhood-watch captain who fatally shot the 17-year-old Martin on Feb. 26 in the central Florida town of Sanford. On one of his 911 calls to police that night, Zimmerman muttered something under his breath that some listeners say sounds like a racial slur. Zimmerman's father is white, and his mother is Latino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It sounds pretty obvious to me,&quot; said Donald Tibbs, a Drexel University law professor who has studied race, civil rights and criminal procedure. &quot;If that was a racial epithet that preceded the attack on Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, we definitely have a hate crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, however, say the recording is not clear enough to determine what Zimmerman said. And many experts say more evidence would be needed that he harbored racial prejudice against black people and went after Martin for that reason alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There had previously been burglaries in the complex committed by young black males, possibly heightening Zimmerman's suspicions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are going to have to show he was specifically targeting this individual based on his race, creed, color, et cetera,&quot; said David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's parents, in a letter to a local newspaper, insisted their son is not a racist. Several black residents of the neighborhood where Martin was shot have only good things to say about Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has not been charged with any crime and is claiming self-defense under Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which eliminates a person's duty to retreat when threatened with serious bodily harm or death. He claims Martin attacked him as he was walking back to his truck, according to police.</SPAN></P>
