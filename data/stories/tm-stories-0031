<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FLORIDA: Members of the New Black Panther Party are offering a $US10,000 ($A9660) reward for the ``capture'' of George Zimmerman, the Neighbourhood Watch volunteer who shot black youth Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman - the man at the centre of the racially charged killing of the unarmed teen - is a former altar boy, insurance salesman and college student. Another label has also stuck in the public's perception: frustrated cop wannabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, his scores of calls to police showed he pursued shoplifters and errant drivers with zeal, reporting pitbulls, potholes, children playing in the street, open garage doors and ``suspicious'' youths, usually black males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of February 26, he tailed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin through the Retreat at Twin Lakes, the gated community where Zimmerman lived with his wife, describing his every move to a dispatcher who told him he didn't need to follow the young man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A scuffle ensued and Zimmerman shot Trayvon dead. Zimmerman claimed it was in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Black Panther leader Mikhail Muhammad announced the reward during a protest in Sanford, Florida, on Saturday. When asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly: ``An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilisation of 10,000 men to capture Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman in Maitland, where the 28-year old worked before the shooting. He declined to say when the group would begin its search.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford city officials condemned the group's appeal and asked citizens to leave arrests to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the New Black Panthers' third protest in the past two weeks over the fatal shooting of the Miami Gardens teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has consistently called for Zimmerman's arrest and threatened to find and detain him if police were not willing to do so.</SPAN></P>
