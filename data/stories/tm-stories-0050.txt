March 26--ROSEVILLE -- An incident Friday night in the parking lot of the Roseville Galleria has officers struggling to figure out what to do, and has shades of Florida's Trayvon Martin case. 
"It's a little bit tough, because at this point, we don't know who the victim is and who the suspect is," Roseville Detective Sergeant Darin De Freese told FOX40.
Roseville detectives say Tyler Jurickovich, an employee at Galleria restaurant Pluto's and another Galleria employee got into some kind of fight in the parking lot around 11 p.m. near the Sears Auto Center.
"We had some type of confrontation occur between two individuals resulting in one of them punching the other and that person then fell on the ground and banged the back of their head," said De Freese.
The confrontation left Jurickovich in a Placer County hospital in critical condition. Detectives believe the fight stemmed from an alleged car burglary.
"One of the subjects confronted the other after finding him in his car and thinking that he was being burglarized, that's why the physical confrontation ensued," said De Freese.
The question is -- when, as a private citizen, are you justified to use force.
De Freese says the law is very clear.
"California law is actually pretty specific. You don't really have the right to use physical force in order to protect property," De Freese explained. "You have the right to use physical force in order to restrain somebody as though you were going to place them under arrest, or to defend yourself, or to defend others."
Because Jurickovich's injuries have left him unable to talk to detectives, the other person involved in the fight hasn't been arrested.
"We only have one side of the story," said De Freese.
