A Florida police chief at the centre of a growing storm over the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white crimewatch volunteer stepped down temporarily Thursday. 
Sanford police Chief Bill Lee, who has been criticized after his department failed to arrest self-appointed watch captain George Zimmerman, said he was leaving his post temporarily because he had become a "distraction.
A million people have signed an online petition calling for justice for 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, shot and killed Feb. 26 by Zimmerman in a gated Florida community.
Martin's father, Tracy, said Lee's move was only the beginning.
"We want an arrest of the murderer of our son," he told a crowd gathered in Sanford.
