<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delayed, grudging justice Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African-American, has been dead for nearly one month, killed on February 26 in Sanford, Florida, by George Zimmerman. Mr Zimmerman is a heat-packing neighbourhood watch captain who frequently called police to report suspicious sightings of black boys in the gated community where he lived and patrolled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state prosecutor in the Central Florida county that includes Sanford announced on Tuesday that a grand jury would convene next month - six weeks after the shooting. This grudging decision came only after Mr Martin's family members began to speak publicly about the disturbing circumstances of his death; only after 911 released recordings showed Mr Zimmerman stalking Mr Martin as the youth walked home with an iced tea and a bag of Skittles; and only after the Justice Department declared that it would step in to determine whether federal civil rights laws were broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even now, with much of the country watching this sleepy outpost one hour north of Walt Disney World, there is reason to worry whether justice will be served.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an edited extract of an editorial published in The Washington Post on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
