A prayer vigil and rally will be held this evening at Tower Grove Park as elected officials, pastors and activists call for an arrest in the death of TrayvonMartin, the unarmed black teenager who was shot and killed last month in Sanford, Fla., by a neighborhood watch volunteer. 
State Rep. Jamila Nasheed announced the vigil and rally at a news conference Thursday evening on the steps of City Hall and urged the U.S. attorney general's office to investigate the shooting.
"We stand in support of the thousands of people who are enraged by the death of TrayvonMartin," said Nasheed, D-St. Louis.
Mayor Fracis Slay is expected to speak at the vigil, which begins at 7 p.m. at the Sons of Rest Pavilion at Tower Grove Park.
