<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 21--The young man walked slowly, leisurely, past as I stood and waited for Desi to relieve himself. The young man didn't speak. I didn't speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I walked Desi around the corner and returned just as the young man was heading back, carrying a white plastic bag, probably from the gas station a block away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, Desi barked at him, fiercely, with all of his 25-pound might. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sorry,&quot; I said. &quot;Ferocious dog on board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's OK,&quot; he said. Then he smiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a smile I'd seen on the face of my brother, my nephew, my friends' sons. And I stood, sadly, realizing that I hadn't seen those faces when I first saw him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What I saw was a guy with baggy pants, not in school, not at work, walking down the street in the middle of the day. I was at home recuperating from surgery. So in my mind, he shouldn't have been there. I didn't wonder who he was or whose he was. I wondered where he was going. I was suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the plight of black men, particularly young black men in America. Because of some, others are harassed, feared, tested and destroyed -- and in Florida two weeks ago, killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questionable suspicion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the difference between George Zimmerman and me is that Zimmerman followed and killed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, whom he found suspicious just because he was walking through the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was heading back to the house where his father lives in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. He was carrying a bag of Skittles and an iced tea when his destiny met Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman called 911 to report Trayvon. He had called 911 dozens of times before the night he killed the boy, the Orlando Sentinel reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That last night, he told the police, &quot;this guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something. It's raining and he's just walking around looking at houses. He's just staring, looking at all the houses. Now he's coming toward me. He's got his hand in his waistband. Something's wrong with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Zimmerman did not know then was that Trayvon also made a call to his girlfriend to tell her some guy was following him. Trayvon was scared. She advised him to run. Trayvon said no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told the dispatcher, &quot;He's coming to check me out. He's got something in his hands. I don't know what his deal is. Can we get an officer over here? These assholes always get away. Shit, he's running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman got out of his car to chase Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you following him?&quot; the dispatcher asked. Zimmerman, according to the Sentinel, calmly responded, &quot;Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;OK, we don't need you to do that,&quot; said the dispatcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman chased Trayvon anyway. At that point, he was no frightened resident or concerned neighborhood watch captain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was a hunter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was after his prey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he was ignoring the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WWB justifies murder?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses later heard a boy's screams, and a single shot -- although police would later say the screams were undetermined and could have been Zimmerman. Yeah, right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses came out to find Zimmerman on top of the 17-year-old kid he has since confessed to shooting to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not at his house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not during the commission of a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But because he was WWB, walking while black, and &quot;these assholes always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford police decided that a Florida law that allows residents to keep themselves and their property safe applies to a man who disobeyed police, hunted down a child and killed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if the city of Sanford and state of Florida won't do what they should have already done -- arrest Zimmerman and charge him with first-degree murder -- then the U.S. Justice Department, which announced that it is investigating the case, will have to do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to every vigilante, concerned resident, or neighborhood watch captain in America, here is the lesson: When you see a kid walking down the street, ask him how he is, and see if he smiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you do, you may just see your son or your nephew or just another kid on the way back from the store, carrying Skittles and an iced tea. If you don't, try harder. That young man may just be afraid of you, too.</SPAN></P>
