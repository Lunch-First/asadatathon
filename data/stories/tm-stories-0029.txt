A group linked to the militant Black Panthers organization has offered a bounty for the capture of George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch captain who killed an unarmed black teenager in Florida.
Churches across the United States held services for Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old whose death last month led to outrage around the country after Zimmerman, 28, was able to plead self-defence to escape prosecution.
At a protest in Sanford, near Orlando, where the killing took place, Mikhail Muhammad, the leader of the New Black Panthers, announced a reward for his apprehension. Asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad said: "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
