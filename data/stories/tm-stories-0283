</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD -- They came from nearby neighborhoods as well as Orlando and Daytona Beach. They came from DeBary, DeLand and New Smyrna Beach. And New York and California, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of people gathered at Fort Mellon Park on the south shore of Lake Monroe, less than three miles from the site of 17- year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's fatal shooting on Feb. 26. They chanted for justice. They waved signs and cheered when civil-rights activists, such as the Rev. Al Sharpton, Benjamin Jealous and Dick Gregory, as well as Martin's parents, called for an arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call has gone out across the country,&quot; said the Rev. L. Ronald Durham, pastor of Greater Friendship Baptist Church in Daytona Beach and one of the rally's organizers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And many of those who answered the call pointed to what they believe was an injustice -- the death of a boy carrying a can of iced tea and a bag of Skittles candy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could have been my child,&quot; said Reggie Sandilands, the New Smyrna Beach father of a 22-year-old Bethune-Cookman University student. &quot;This goes on every day, all over the place, not just in Sanford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By &quot;this,&quot; he was referring to young black men being viewed as suspicious, something dangerous, something they're not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he is convinced race played a role in the way the Sanford police handled the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch captain who has been described as both white and Hispanic, told police he shot Martin in self defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had it been a black man that shot a white kid, he would have been locked up immediately,&quot; Sandilands said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marie Rudd of DeBary came to the rally with her husband and granddaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several years earlier, when she lived in Sanford, she got to know Martin, who played piano with her niece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was such a loving young man,&quot; Rudd said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was just very friendly. Everyone adored him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She heard about his death on the television news the day after the shooting and is outraged an arrest hasn't been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I truly hope that justice prevails and Zimmerman gets what he deserves,&quot; Rudd said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He killed the child,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kinds of assumptions she believes Zimmerman made about Martin -- that he was a dangerous criminal because he was young, black, unfamiliar and wearing a hooded sweatshirt, are all too common, Rudd said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could be my child or your child,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan DuPree of DeLand and her friend Martha Bryant-Hall of Maitland -- veterans of decades of civil rights marches -- commiserated about having to come together once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've done this before,&quot; said DuPree, who was wearing an Occupy DeLand button.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another friend, Christe Ashley of DeLand, said the Occupy movement and those supporting Martin's family in calling for Zimmerman's arrest have one basic commonality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're all human beings,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where there is injustice, we need to stand up against it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. John Long, senior pastor at Tubman-King Community Church in Daytona Beach, arrived at the rally and felt a wave of emotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a mixture. It's sadness at the reason why we're gathered. There's also great pride to see so many expressing a spirit of unity and peace,&quot; said Long, who was among the speakers addressing the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long and others, including Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents -- Tracy Martin and Sabrina Fulton -- reacted to one of Thursday's developments, the announcement that Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee will step down temporarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's long overdue,&quot; Long said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fulton thanked God for the gathering before commenting on Lee's status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's temporary relief but we need a permanent relief,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need an arrest today.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Zimmerman's claim of shooting the teen in self defense has been questioned by community leaders. &quot;He had been so looking forward to going to his junior prom, and he had already started talking about all the senior activities in high school,&quot; his mother, Sybrina Fulton, 46, said in a voice hollowed and somber. &quot;He will never do any of those things.&quot; Associated PressPhoto 4: Marie RuddPhoto 5: John Long</SPAN></P>
