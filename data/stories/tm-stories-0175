<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The furor over the Florida shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin has created a new symbol of solidarity: the humble hooded sweatshirt known as the hoodie. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBA star LeBron James tweeted the above photo of his teammates on the Miami Heat, heads bowed, all in hoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund posed in one, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point today, NPR was leading its website with a comprehensive trend story. Twitter is alive with hashtags and tweets on the subject, many of them defiant in tone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in major cities, thousands are turning out for Million Hoodie Marches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of the symbol took on new momentum Friday following Geraldo Rivera's warning on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; to teens and parents that wearing a hoodie, as Martin did when he was shot, was dangerous and sent a negative message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You cannot rehabilitate the hoodie,&quot; Rivera said. &quot;Stop wearing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some may have heeded that advice; many others found it appalling, only adding to the problem of racial stereotyping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powerful feelings of anger and injustice have found a powerful, if unpredictable, visual symbol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NPR's Linton Weeks quoted former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, who summed up well what's happening: &quot;The hoodie is a way of expressing support for the Martin family,&quot; she said,&quot;and for all the sons of African American families who bear the heavy burden of other people's negative assumptions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
