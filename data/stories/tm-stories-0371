<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin tragedy is shining a national spotlight on &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws in at least 21 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laws -- in places such as Texas, Idaho and Alaska -- allow everyday citizens to use deadly force against someone else if they fear for their life. They also say people do not have to retreat if threatened or attacked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Fla., fatally shot Trayvon as the 17-year-old was walking to his father's home. Zimmerman told police he was attacked by Trayvon and acted in self-defense. He has not been arrested or charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has triggered  public outcry to change or repeal Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want to know how you can kill somebody legally in Florida?&quot; said Arthur Hayhoe of the Florida Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. &quot;Make sure you have no witnesses, hunt the person down and then say you feared for your life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hayhoe said he has about a dozen cases on his desk now similar to Trayvon's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law emerged after a man shot and killed a burglar who officials say was trying to break into the man's RV after Hurricane Ivan in 2005. The man waited months before learning he would not be charged with murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case inspired then-Florida state senator Durell Peaden, a Republican, to introduce a bill dealing with similar situations. State Rep. Dennis Baxley, the bill's House sponsor, told USA TODAY the law empowers people to defend themselves and should not be challenged in the wake of this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time you have an adverse incident, immediately the anti-gun faction will say this law is the problem,&quot; said Baxley, a Republican, adding that violent crime in Florida has dropped since its implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The perpetrators know everyone has the right to defend themselves.  I think that has been a strong deterrent,&quot; Baxley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the law was enacted in 2005, the number of justifiable homicides in Florida has skyrocketed, said state Sen. Oscar Braynon, a Democrat who represents the area in Miami where Trayvon lived with his mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, justifiable homicides  have been slowly rising since 2005. The number in 2010, the last full year measured by the FBI, was 278.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baxley thinks the jump  shows the law is working. &quot;The perpetrator suffered instead of the person they were victimizing,&quot; he said. &quot;That's what those numbers mean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some gun-control advocates say the numbers underscore an increasingly aggressive mentality on the streets, fueled in part by state laws such as Florida's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's part of this increasing effort to push more guns into more public places,&quot; said Daniel Vice of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Braynon and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, have said they support a review of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been great for defense lawyers,&quot; said Richard Rosenbaum, a  Fort Lauderdale attorney. &quot;It has helped a lot of people get off on self-defense that would have been found guilty before 2005.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
