<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buffalo community activists Randy Sargent and Tyrone Ferguson said they will see if they need permits from City Hall to keep their new &quot;Voice of Homicide&quot; group's protest going in Niagara Square over the killing of an unarmed 17-year-old in Sanford, Fla., last month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several dozen members of Occupy Buffalo on Wednesday night joined about a dozen people who came out to support Sargent and Ferguson and their efforts to seek justice for the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a black teenager who was shot to death Feb. 26 by George Zimmerman, a Neighborhood Watch volunteer in a gated community in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Occupy Buffalo group also returned to Niagara Square for a general meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sargent said he expects to lead a protest march around the square beginning at about 6 a.m. today. He will be joined by Ferguson when he completes other scheduled business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sargent and Ferguson said they plan to continue a peaceful protest in the square for the slain Martin &quot;until there is justice&quot; in the case, Ferguson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two said they plan to protest from about 6 a.m. to midnight seven days a week until law enforcement takes action against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was visiting his father in a townhouse in a Sanford gated community and had gone to a nearby convenience store for snacks in the light rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, captain of the community's Neighborhood Watch, called police and said he was following a &quot;suspicious&quot; person. By the time police arrived, they found Zimmerman with a bloody nose and Trayvon facedown in the grass, shot in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman claimed he shot the youth in self-defense. He has not been charged with any criminal activity, but a grand jury is reportedly about to begin reviewing the fatal shooting of the unarmed teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday evening in Niagara Square, Chris Barbara, a member of the Occupy Buffalo movement, said his organization was joining in the protest being staged by Sargent and Ferguson &quot;because Occupy Buffalo supports all nonviolent efforts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sargent and Ferguson said they hope their efforts will prompt similar protests nationwide.</SPAN></P>
