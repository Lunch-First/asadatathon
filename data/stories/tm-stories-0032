<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House has hit back at accusations that Barack Obama was playing politics with the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 17-year-old was gunned down in Florida last month by a self-styled neighbourhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman. The unarmed teenager was buying candy at a convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said on Friday: &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon&quot;, and his parents were &quot;right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and we're going to get to the bottom of what happened&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remarks were condemned as &quot;disgraceful&quot; by Newt Gingrich, the would-be Republican presidential candidate. &quot;Any young American of any ethnic background should be safe, period. We should all be horrified, no matter what the ethnic background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is the president suggesting that if it had been a white who'd been shot, that would be OK, because it wouldn't look like him? That's just nonsense,&quot; he said. &quot;Trying to turn it into a racial issue is fundamentally wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On ABC's This Week yesterday a White House senior adviser, David Plouffe, described Gingrich's comments as &quot;irresponsible&quot; and &quot;reckless&quot;. &quot;Speaker Gingrich is clearly in the last throes of his political career,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
