<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 24--Latasha Fuller, a sophomore at Winston-Salem State University, never knew Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old teenager shot and killed last month in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, the 28-year-old man who was captain of his gated community's neighborhood watch association, told Sanford Police investigators that he shot Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police declined to charge Zimmerman, sparking outrage across the country. State and federal authorities are investigating, and Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee has stepped down temporarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Fuller thinks what happened to Martin could happen to other young black men, such as her brother or cousin, if someone sees them as suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fuller and more than 30 other Winston-Salem State students gathered Friday at Coltrane Hall on campus to discuss what they could do to raise awareness about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larry Little, a professor at Winston-Salem State University, and other faculty members and the Rev. Carlton Eversley, a member of the Ministers Conference of Winston-Salem and Vicinity, helped the students brainstorm ideas and urged them to fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon may not be physically with us, but we can win this battle for justice,&quot; Little said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winston-Salem State students are planning a rally Wednesday. The details are still being worked out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Wake Forest University Black Law Students Association is hosting a candlelight vigil at 8 p.m. Monday in the law school's courtyard. S. Wayne Patterson, the president of the local chapter of the NAACP, Forsyth District Judge Denise Hartsfield and Walter Marshall, a Forsyth County commissioner, will be among the speakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are joining others across the country who have held demonstrations, demanding that Zimmerman be arrested and charged in Martin's killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darryl Hunt, who was exonerated in 2004 after spending nearly 19 years in prison for a murder that he did not commit, urged Winston-Salem State students to continue fighting for justice in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday it was Trayvon. Tomorrow it could be you,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
