The White House has hit back at accusations that Barack Obama was playing politics with the death of TrayvonMartin.
The 17-year-old was gunned down in Florida last month by a self-styled neighbourhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman. The unarmed teenager was buying candy at a convenience store.
Obama said on Friday: "If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon", and his parents were "right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and we're going to get to the bottom of what happened".
The remarks were condemned as "disgraceful" by Newt Gingrich, the would-be Republican presidential candidate. "Any young American of any ethnic background should be safe, period. We should all be horrified, no matter what the ethnic background.
"Is the president suggesting that if it had been a white who'd been shot, that would be OK, because it wouldn't look like him? That's just nonsense," he said. "Trying to turn it into a racial issue is fundamentally wrong."
On ABC's This Week yesterday a White House senior adviser, David Plouffe, described Gingrich's comments as "irresponsible" and "reckless". "Speaker Gingrich is clearly in the last throes of his political career," he said.
