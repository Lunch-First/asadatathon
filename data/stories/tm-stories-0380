<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE UNARMED black teenager killed by a white neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida sounded worried about a stranger following him just before he was shot, it was revealed Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, was on the phone with his girlfriend, when she overheard part of the fatal Feb. 26 encounter with George Zimmerman in a Sanford, Fla., gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said, 'Run!' Trayvon said he not (sic) going to run,&quot; the girlfriend said in a 59-second audiotape played for reporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next I heard Trayvon say, 'Well, what you following me for?' &quot; said the 16-year-old girlfriend, whose name was not released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she heard someone asking Trayvon, &quot;What are you doing around here?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next thing I heard, someone push Trayvon because (his) headset just fell,&quot; she said, explaining that the teen's cell phone cut off right before the deadly gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Trayvon's family, insisted the phone call contradicts Zimmerman's account of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This young lady connects the dots. She completely blows Zimmerman's absurd self-defense claim out of the water,&quot; said Crump, renewing demands for Zimmerman's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest twist in the case that has garnered national attention came as the Rev. Al Sharpton said he would go to Florida Thursday to demand justice for Trayvon's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This family has only asked for justice,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;They've not called anybody names. They've acted in a dignified way. They deserve this nation's support, and we're coming to give it to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced its Civil Rights Division has launched an investigation into the killing, and the FBI was monitoring the probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Seminole County grand jury will convene April 10 to hear evidence in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was visiting family in the neighborhood when he was shot while walking back from a store, where he had bought a bag of Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 911 call before the shooting, Zimmerman, 28, told a dispatcher that he was following &quot;a real suspicious guy&quot; who had &quot;something in his hand.&quot; The dispatcher told Zimmerman to stop following the teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later, another 911 call from a neighbor captures someone screaming for help and a single gunshot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's father said he believed the pleas for help were his son's last words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zimmerman told cops it was him yelling for help, Trayvon's father, Tracy Martin, said the voice sounded like his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's heart-wrenching, because those actually were my son's last words,&quot; Tracy Martin told CNN Tuesday. &quot;And to hear his last words being cries of help, is devastating. It tears me apart as a father.&quot;</SPAN></P>
