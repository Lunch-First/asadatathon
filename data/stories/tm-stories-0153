<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Social media play a role in drawing a crowd to a rally in the city that echoes calls for justice in the case of the slain Sanford teen.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a rally with the flavor of a 1960s civil rights march. But this one came in the age of Facebook and the smartphone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 600 and 1,000 people marched to one of Tampa's busiest intersections Saturday in a call for justice in the case of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. He's the unarmed, black 17-year-old who was shot and killed on Feb. 26 by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 28, who claimed self-defense in the shooting, has not been arrested or charged, sparking national outrage. Zimmerman's father is white, his mother Latina, according to neighbors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of Martin's family attended the event, organizers said, but were not available for interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally started in Al Lopez Park. Protesters carried signs that said &quot;I am Trayvon&quot; or &quot;Justice for Trayvon.&quot; They marched to the intersection of N Dale Mabry Highway and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, often chanting &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in the crowd wore hoodies or carried bags of Skittles, just as Martin did when he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event was organized by a small Facebook group called Real Talk: Real Answers, and organizers said they were stunned to draw such a large crowd just 72 hours after they first talked of holding the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decades ago, the black community organized around its churches with calls to action often coming from the pulpit. And while that is still true, organizers said social media have amplified the conversation about race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Social media have expanded the racial discussion in this country and in the world,&quot; said Jean Vixamar, 37, one of the leaders of the Facebook group. Social media, he said, &quot;erase barriers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artist Rob Mitchell, 23, of Tampa said he learned of the event through Facebook. &quot;I caught the buzz,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the technology has changed, the message of racial equality and justice was an echo of the protests by earlier generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jazz Young, 20, of Tampa came to the rally with her two young sons and said Martin's death is a chilling reminder to any mother about how quickly tragedy can strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was someone's baby,&quot; Young said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brande Ford, 22, of Tampa attended with her 2-year-old daughter. She said the Martin case showed the black community that while issues of race have improved since the days of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., there was still work to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This happened even though we have a black president and all,&quot; Ford said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orlando Davis, 40, host of the morning show on hip-hop station WLLD-FM (Wild 94.1), said social media had revolutionized protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This makes a president address this issue,&quot; Davis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama referenced the case on Friday, saying, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters were encouraged to call Gov. Rick Scott's office. While Scott appointed a special prosecutor to the Martin case, many in the crowd said they worried that the ineptness of Sanford police might have guaranteed Zimmerman would never be charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God wants this to be brought out,&quot; said Krystal Bowens, one of the organizers. &quot;He wants justice. ... The truth will come out. I know it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonya Wideman, 47, of Tampa held a sign that said, &quot;Please don't kill my son.&quot; Her T-shirt was emblazoned, &quot;Florida's Free Monsters.&quot; Below were pictures of Zimmerman and Casey Anthony, who was acquitted last year in the death of her 2-year-old daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinonye Umunnah, 32, of Gibsonton said Facebook empowers communities large and small. King, she said, accomplished so much before his 1968 death. But she tried to imagine what he might have accomplished with a tool like Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would have been amazing,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uhuru to meet today</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement will host a community meeting for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin at 4 p.m. today at the Uhuru House at 1245 18th Ave. S in St. Petersburg. Organizers will discuss plans for a St. Petersburg rally to be held at 11 a.m. Saturday. For more information, call (727) 821-6620.</SPAN></P>
