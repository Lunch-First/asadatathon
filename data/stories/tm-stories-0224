<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid mounting public outrage, the Justice Department is stepping in to scrutinize the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin last month in Florida. The scrutiny is appropriate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was shot by George Zimmerman, a member of the neighborhood watch in the Sanford community on a rainy night after Zimmerman had dialed 911 and reported that Martin was acting suspiciously and then running away. The dispatcher said a patrol car would arrive and instructed Zimmerman not to pursue the young man. Within minutes, Zimmerman had fatally shot Martin, who was unarmed. Martin's family and friends dispute Zimmerman's characterization of him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Zimmerman has not been arrested, perhaps in part because of Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which allows citizens to use deadly force in self-defense even without exhausting other options first. A single tragedy cannot invalidate all of the reasons such laws have been passed, but there are enough questions about Martin's death that a thorough examination is not only warranted but imperative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further information might exonerate Zimmerman of any intentional wrongdoing. But if he did indeed gun down an innocent young man in cold blood, he must not be allowed to get away with it.</SPAN></P>
