<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT LEAST 21 US states have adopted the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws that allowed the killer of unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin to walk free after Trayvon's shooting three weeks ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a self-appointed Neighbourhood Watch captain, shot Trayvon dead when he saw him walking through a gated community after the youth bought a packet of Skittles and a bottle of iced tea from a local store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman told police he believed Trayvon was acting suspiciously and appeared to have followed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, supported by the National Rifle Association and introduced by Jeb Bush when he was governor of Florida, extends the right to use lethal force in self-defence from the home into the public domain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be protected by the law it is not necessary for a killer to prove that he or she was threatened, just that they believed they were. Or, in the words of the act, if a person &quot;reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday Mr Bush said he did not believe the law applied in this case because it appeared that Mr Zimmerman had followed Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been protests across the US over the past few days, with activists demanding Mr Zimmerman's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the radical New Black Panther Party have even offered a $US10,000 ($A9660) reward for his &quot;capture&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the journalists who propelled the case to national attention, Ta-Nehisi Coates, a senior editor for The Atlantic, has said that the law seems to have protected killers in other cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 21, Greyston Garcia was acquitted under the law after chasing Pedro Roteta, 26, for a block before stabbing him after Mr Roteta stole his truck radio. Mr Roteta was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police who charged Mr Garcia said the judge's decision was a &quot;travesty of justice&quot;. Also in Florida, Brandon Baker was shot dead by Seth Browning after a traffic altercation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we have in Florida - and doubtlessly in other parts of the country - is the state relinquishing a crucial aspect of meting out justice,&quot; Coates writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The logic here militates towards getting a gun - even for people who don't like guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar laws are being fought over in other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I anticipate that some people will try to use this unfortunate incident as an excuse not to expand Iowans' right to self-defence,&quot; said the Iowa legislation's author, Republican Matt Windschitl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not every &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, however, came from a Republican-controlled state. Oklahoma's Democratic governor signed one in 2006. So did Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano, when she was the Democratic governor of Arizona. In Alabama, a bill identical to Florida's was first introduced by a Democrat. With</SPAN></P>
