<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 23--The failure to make an arrest in the shooting death of Miami-Dade teenager Trayvon Martin could be sending the wrong message to neighborhood watch groups, state legislators and South Florida residents say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, of Miami Gardens, was followed and confronted by George Zimmerman, the head of a neighborhood watch group in Sanford, even though a police dispatcher told Zimmerman that he didn't need to pursue the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford police haven't arrested Zimmerman, who argues the Feb. 26 shooting was self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is letting people think, 'I could possibly use deadly force and get away with it,'&quot; Sen. Chris Smith, D-Fort Lauderdale, said Thursday. &quot;I think you will see an increase in armed neighborhood watches. That's a concern for the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the killing sparks an increase in vigilante-style confrontations remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Florida's law enforcement agencies tell their sanctioned Citizens on Patrol volunteer programs, as well as local neighborhood watches: Report suspicious activity to 911. Don't play police officer. Don't pursue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're told not to intervene, only to report suspicious activity,&quot; said Broward sheriff's spokeswoman Veda Coleman-Wright. &quot;They're prohibited from carrying weapons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day of the Sanford shooting, Zimmerman called a police non-emergency line to report a person unknown to him as suspicious. Zimmerman can be heard pursuing Martin, even after dispatchers tell him not to. He describes Martin as a black male who looked like he was &quot;up to no good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unclear exactly what happened during the altercation, but Martin died from a gunshot wound to the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith plans to spearhead a rewrite of Florida's Stand Your Ground law, which he says is too vague in allowing the use of deadly force in &quot;self-defense&quot; situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he doubts the controversy surrounding Martin's killing would deter overzealous residents from carrying weapons during patrols. Floridians are allowed to have firearms and conceal them if they have a permit, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting criticized for shooting a teenager is &quot;one thing,&quot; Smith said. &quot;But not getting arrested and convicted because people think it's legal under the law? Oh God, I could just imagine what kind of message that sends out to the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beryl Collins, 72, president of the Lauderhill Central Residents Association, said her neighborhood's watch program, established five years ago, is essentially a pact among residents to look after one another's property, complete with &quot;neighborhood watch&quot; signs added near roadways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins said it would be reprehensible if any residents opted to conduct armed patrols. &quot;It's a very bad idea,&quot; she said. &quot;Because people like that are going to be trigger-happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said neighbors' phone calls to 911 have lead to several home burglary arrests over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It can be done without a gun,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's actions were against guidelines followed by countless volunteer programs across the United States, according to the National Sheriffs' Association, a nonprofit which officially launched the Neighborhood Watch Program in 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent statement, Aaron D. Kennard, the association's executive director, referred to Zimmerman as a &quot;self-appointed neighborhood watchman&quot; who &quot;significantly contradicts the principles&quot; of watch programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kennard said the association had no record of Zimmerman's group registering as a neighborhood watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The alleged participant ignored everything the Neighborhood Watch Program stands for, and it resulted in a young man losing his life,&quot; Kennard wrote.</SPAN></P>
