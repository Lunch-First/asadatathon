<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A scandal that began with an act of vigilantism is threatening to breed more of the same, after a weekend of escalating tension saw militant activists announce a $10,000 (&pound;6,300) reward for the &quot;capture&quot; of black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's killer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer who followed and then shot the unarmed boy, had the bounty publicly placed on his head during a protest in Sanford, the Florida town where Trayvon died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was announced by Mikhail Muhammad, leader of a small militant organisation called the New Black Panther Party, who said he was seeking up to 10,000 black men willing to form a militia to find Mr Zimmerman and administer what they regard as justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he was inciting violence, Mr Muhammad said: &quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.&quot; To cheers from followers, who wore black uniforms, he promised: &quot;If the government won't do the job, we'll do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments were denounced by mainstream civil rights campaigners. Jesse Jackson, who preached at a Baptist church in Sanford yesterday, called it a &quot;diversion,&quot; telling reporters: &quot;I think disciplined, persistent, non-violent action works.&quot; They nonetheless highlight the increasingly-polarised nature of the controversy surrounding Trayvon's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 17-year-old, who was shot on 26 February, was remembered during protests in Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago, New York and several other American cities over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators wore hooded tops and carried bags of Skittles, the brand of confectionery Trayvon was carrying during his fatal journey from a local convenience store to the home of his father's girlfriend, in a community called The Retreat at Twin Lakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of Mr Zimmerman, who claims to have killed Trayvon in self-defence, began publicly lobbying on his behalf. Joe Oliver, a &quot;family friend&quot; who appeared on ABC television yesterday, said that he &quot;couldn't stop crying&quot; about the incident and now fears for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Oliver, who is mixed-race, was accompanied by Craig Sonner, Mr Zimmerman's lawyer. Both men vigorously denied that their friend is racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Records show that Mr Zimmerman called emergency services almost 50 times in the past year to report suspicious activity in his neighbourhood.</SPAN></P>
