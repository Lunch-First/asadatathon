<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House officials almost certainly knew President Barack Obama would be asked about the Trayvon Martin shooting soon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has stirred immense passion nationwide because of its racial element: Martin, who was unarmed, was killed by George Zimmerman, 28, a Hispanic neighbourhood watch volunteer, who told police that he shot the black teenager in self-defence. Zimmerman has not been charged over Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama did not deal with the details of the incident, discussing the racially charged incident with deep emotion without saying the words &quot;black&quot; or &quot;race&quot;. Obama's new approach is at once deeply personal and completely universal, and avidly avoids taking sides in a political fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His appeal on Friday was to the parents. &quot;I can only imagine what these parents are going through,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pulls together - federal, state and local - to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embedded in his remarks in the Rose Garden was a particular message about being a black parent. &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said. &quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
