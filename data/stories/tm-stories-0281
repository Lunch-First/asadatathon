<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The famous and the unsung took to Facebook and Twitter in hooded sweatshirts on Thursday in solidarity with the family of a black teenager shot to death by a Hispanic neighbourhood watch captain in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spontaneous social media effort by dozens came a day after a few hundred people joined the Million Hoodie March on Wednesday night to protest the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They changed their profile pictures and tweeted photos of themselves wearing hoodies, many also posing the question: &quot;Do I look suspicious?&quot; or using the Twitter hashtag &quot;IAmTrayvonMartin&quot; in a show of frustration and outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm and Marian Wright Edelman, who heads the Children&quot;s defence Fund, joined the fray, which included everyone from grandmothers to a group of law students from Howard University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wanted to stand with all the young people who are standing up for justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Edelman said in a statement. &quot;I wanted to protest that Walking While Black and wearing a hoodie should lead to a death sentence in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No arrests have been made in the case, angering Trayvon&quot;s mother, Tracy Martin, and the family&quot;s supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 commenters on Facebook cheered the photo posted by Granholm, host of &quot;The War Room&quot; on the progressive cable network Current TV. She served two terms as governor before term limits ended her administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hoodie is a way of expressing support for the Martin family, and for all the sons of African American families who bear the heavy burden of other people&quot;s negative assumptions,&quot; Granholm said in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon died Feb. 26. He was returning to the home of his father&quot;s fiancee in a gated community in the city after buying candy at a convenience store. He was unarmed and was wearing a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighbourhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, has not been charged in the shooting. Zimmerman has said the teen attacked him and he shot him in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, who has been excoriated for not arresting Zimmerman, temporarily stepped down Thursday, saying he had become a distraction to the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adrienne Garrett, 37, a family and community involvement coordinator for a middle school in Florida, said she tweeted herself with dark hood up and bangs peeking out to support Trayvon&quot;s mother and family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel for her,&quot; Garrett said. &quot;Being in the school system and seeing these young boys, it&quot;s hard for them to go out and be safe without being profiled. It&quot;s just frustrating, and it&quot;s been going on for years and years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
