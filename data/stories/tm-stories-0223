<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amar'e Stoudemire arrived at Air Canada Centre in a sweater with a  hood raised over his head and when he took the court for pregame  warm-ups, he wore a Knicks hoodie, the hood again over his head.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stoudemire wanted to show his support for the protests in the wake  of the fatal shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last month by a community  watchman. Part of the reasoning for the shooting was that the  17-year-old was threatening because he was wearing a hoodie.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I mean, it's just a matter of us understanding that we all have to  be positive influences on the community,&quot; said Stoudemire, who grew  up in Orlando, just 20 minutes from Sanford, Fla., where the  shooting occurred. &quot;If you're going to be a watchman, be a positive  watchman in the community. I think it's all about uplifting the  community and keeping everybody together for a positive message.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Florida state representative Alan Williams sent out a request via  twitter to Stoudemire, along with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and  Chris Paul to wear hoodies during warm-ups at their games. But  Stoudemire said he had not seen that and chose to do this on his  own.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Stoudemire posted a photo on his Twitter account, @Amareisreal,  wearing a sweater with a hood and declaring that he had his hoodie  on. Carmelo Anthony also posted a photo of himself wearing one with  the words, &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; Wade posted a photo of himself  with a hoodie and spoke out about it, and James then posted a Heat  team photo with the entire group wearing hoodies.   </SPAN></P>
