<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BARACK Obama stepped into the controversy over the shooting of an unarmed black teenager last night amid fears the killing could cause race riots across America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black leaders demanded justice as angry protests by thousands of demonstrators threatened to boil over into violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, was shot dead by an overzealous neighbourhood watch volunteer when he went out to buy a bag of Skittles near his Florida home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the shooting happened nearly a month ago, the Hispanic gunman is still free, claiming he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton and the teenager's family have led demands for the arrest of 28-year-old amateur lawman George Zimmerman, claiming the killing was racially motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an attempt to defuse the tension, the President made an emotional plea for America to do some 'soul searching' over the tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,' said Mr Obama, a father of two daughters, Malia, 13, and Sasha, ten. He spoke out after coming under attack from some black leaders for failing to comment on a case that had been dominating the U.S. news for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,' said Mr Obama at the White House. 'Every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pull together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Obviously this is a tragedy. I can only imagine what these parents are going through. All of us have to do some soul searching to figure out how something like this has happened.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students in at least eight Florida schools walked out in protest yesterday and more demonstrations are planned around the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the embattled police chief in Sanford, Florida, where the shooting happened, stepped down because of the widespread condemnation of his failure to arrest Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move did little to mollify a crowd of thousands at a rally held later in the Orlando suburb. Mr Sharpton, standing with Trayvon's parents, told the crowd: 'We want George Zimmerman in court with handcuffs behind his back.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford police chief Bill Lee insisted there was no evidence to arrest Zimmerman, who claimed he was forced to shoot in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was heard on a police radio dispatcher's tape saying he was following the teenager on February 26. 'This guy looks like he's up to no good . . . these ****holes always get away,' he said.</SPAN></P>
