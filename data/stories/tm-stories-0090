The one-month anniversary of Martin's death is Monday. He was shot while wearing a &quot;hoodie&quot; as he walked home on a rainy night in a gated community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighborhood watch volunteer who shot him, 28-year-old George Zimmerman, is the son of a white father and Hispanic mother, and the demands to charge him in Martin's slaying have grown ever louder. He had called police to report the hooded figure as suspicious; the 17-year-old Martin was carrying a bag of Skittles and a can of iced tea, talking to his girlfriend on his cellphone. In African-American and other religious centers from Florida to Atlanta, New York and Chicago, messages from pulpits couldn't help but touch on a seemingly avoidable tragedy that continues to be rife with more questions than answers. But while the call continued for the arrest of Zimmerman, there were also pleas to use the incident to spark a larger movement. &quot;How do we turn pain into power?&quot; the Rev. Jesse Jackson asked a standing-room only congregation of hundreds while preaching at Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church in Eatonville, Fla., about 20 miles from the site of the Sanford shooting. &quot;How do we go from a moment to a movement that curries favor?&quot; Jackson preached a sermon entitled &quot;The Substance of Things Hoped For.&quot; He called for Martin's &quot;martyr&quot; death to be used as an opportunity to revive the Civil Rights Commission and draw attention to long-standing issues. Very young children and teens sat in the choir behind him. House GOP budget plan heats up as campaign issue WASHINGTON - The new debt-slashing budget plan pushed by House Republicans heated up as a presidential campaign issue Sunday as the proposal's architect, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, sparred with top Democrats over its political fallout and downplayed the possibility he could be tapped as a vice presidential candidate. Senior White House adviser David Plouffe dismissed the GOP plan Sunday as &quot;a lot of candy, not a lot of vegetables,&quot; and charged that it would be &quot;rubber-stamped&quot; as law if leading Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney is elected. &quot;This is really the Romney-Ryan plan,&quot; Plouffe said, adding that its mix of across-the-board tax cuts and stiff budget cuts &quot;showers huge tax cuts on millionaires and billionaires paid for by senior and veterans.&quot; Ryan tried to tamp down speculation that he could be tapped for the No. 2 spot on the GOP ticket, although who will be the nominee is far from settled. &quot;I would have to consider it, but it's not something I'm even thinking about right now because right - I think our job in Congress is pretty important,&quot; Ryan said. &quot;And what we believe we owe the country is, if we don't like the direction the president is taking us, which we don't, we owe them a specific sharp contrast and a different path that they can select in November. And doing this in Congress is really important.&quot; Student shot to death on Mississippi State campus STARKVILLE, Miss. - A 21-year-old student was shot to death in a Mississippi State University dormitory, though the killing appears to be isolated and there is no indication others may be in danger, officials said Sunday. University president Mark Keenum said Sunday in a statement on the school's website that the killing of 21-year-old John Sanderson of Madison, Miss., was the first time a student had been shot on the campus. Keenum said officials could reveal few other details because of the ongoing investigation. University spokeswoman Maridith Geuder said police received a call about the shooting at Evans Hall around 10 p.m. Saturday. Sanderson was taken to Oktibbeha County Hospital, where he died. Three male suspects fled the building in a blue Crown Victoria. No arrests have been made. Shortly after the shooting, the university began sending a series of text message alerts to students. Police officers stepped up patrols to make sure the campus was safe, Keenum said. The four-story Evans Hall holds about 300 male students and is located on the north side of campus. The campus of about 20,000 students is located in a rural area in the northeastern part of the state, about 125 miles northeast of Jackson. Iraqi woman severely beaten in Calif. home dies EL CAJON, Calif. - A woman from Iraq who was found beaten next to a threatening note saying &quot;go back to your country&quot; has died, and police are investigating the possibility of a hate crime. Hanif Mohebi, the director of the San Diego chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said Shaima Alawadi was taken off life support Saturday. &quot;The family is in shock at the moment. They're still trying to deal with what happened,&quot; said Mohebi, who met with family members. Alawadi, a 32-year-old mother of five, had been hospitalized since her 17-year-old daughter found her unconscious in the dining room of the family's El Cajon home in suburban San Diego on Wednesday, police Lt. Steve Shakowski said. &quot;A hate crime is one of the possibilities, and we will be looking at that,&quot; Lt. Mark Coit said. &quot;We don't want to focus on only one issue and miss something else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
