<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 25--YORK, Pa. -- He reminded Narissa Knight of boys she sees everyday, passing by her home en route to nearby William Penn Senior High School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wasn't from York, but he could have been, she said, standing next to friend Corrie Orr, who carried a handmade cardboard sign reading &quot;Hoodie. Skittles. Iced Tea. Black. Do I match the profile?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, was wearing a hooded sweatshirt Feb. 26 when he was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida after a trip to a convenience store. He was unarmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The volunteer, George Zimmerman, told police he shot the black teenager in self-defense -- a claim that has fueled demonstrations nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm outraged for (Martin's) family -- that they had to go through this,&quot; said Elisha Brantley, another York resident standing with Orr and Knight at an anti-violence rally Saturday at the York County Judicial Center. &quot;There's no way to make it right. A little boy is gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knight allows her 12-year-old daughter to walk to the corner store by herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope we're a nation where you can do that and know your child will come home,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Brantley, she's a bit more cautious when it comes to letting her three children -- two boys and a girl -- out of sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone thinks I'm hard,&quot; she said, &quot;but I'd much rather have my kids than a body bag if I let them run to the store.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three women stood among more than 200 people who, despite the Saturday afternoon downpour, met at spots around the city before converging on the courthouse steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, people get shot and killed in the rain, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And their funerals are held rain or shine, one presenter pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not just about blacks,&quot; said the Rev. Frank Hawkins of Maranatha Church in York. &quot;It's about all the violence going on. There's been a lot of killings here in the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diana Lee and her 14-year-old son, Mykel, drove from Dallastown to support the cause. In the car, family conversation focused Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's slaying, more than 1,000 miles south of York County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Self-defense isn't violence,&quot; Diana Lee said. &quot;Violence is when you purposely hurt somebody or kill somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some reports suggest Martin and Zimmerman engaged in an altercation before the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just think that guy is somewhat like an idiot,&quot; Mykel Lee said. &quot;He was never registered as a neighborhood watchman. . . . If someone takes a swing at you, you don't take out a gun and shoot them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others didn't seem so sure about the shooting, now under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you go by what's being told, you would think that (Zimmerman) is wrong -- that he had no reason to do what he did,&quot; said James Mosely of Manchester Township. &quot;But both sides still need to be told.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elmer Speer, pastor at Manor Baptist Church in York, favors Pennsylvania's Castle Doctrine. The bill, which became law last year, eliminates a requirement that a person retreat or find a safe place before resorting to deadly force outside the home.&quot;I don't want to go back to the Wild West,&quot; he said, &quot;but historically, there were less killings then than there are now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes there's more to be told about Zimmerman's motive in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He may have very well overstepped his bounds,&quot; Speer added. &quot;But it's a difficult thing. There's violence within the law and without the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
