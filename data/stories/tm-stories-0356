<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's running,&quot; George Zimmerman told 911.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you following him?&quot; the dispatcher asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't need you to do that,&quot; the dispatcher said, echoing the advice Palm Beach County police agencies said they would have given him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman confronted Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in his gated community in Sanford, north of Orlando, and fatally shot the Miami Gardens 17-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He calls it self-defense. Martin's family calls it murder and wants the neighborhood watch volunteer criminally charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mostly not in dispute: If Zimmerman doesn't leave his car, Martin isn't dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement authorities instruct neighborhood watches, and even sanctioned volunteer programs such as Citizens on Patrol, or COP, to never approach or pursue someone, but rather to call 911 -- and to never use a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sheriff's office has more than 3,000 COP volunteers. Many wear uniforms and drive marked sheriff's cruisers. But they do not carry weapons and are instructed not to confront people but to be &quot;eyes and ears,&quot; spokeswoman Teri Barbera said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said officer Ellen Lovejoy, spokeswoman for Palm Beach Gardens police: &quot;We always tell people not to confront. Not just neighborhood watch groups. Everyone. To call the police department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There should have been no confrontation whatsoever. Make your phone call. Stand aside,&quot; said Chris Tutko, director of Neighborhood Watch for the National Sheriff's Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Retreat at Twin Lakes community told Sanford police it wanted to start a neighborhood watch, city volunteer program coordinator Wendy Dorival spoke to them in September. Her PowerPoint presentation, and a neighborhood watch manual the city makes available, both make clear: Don't confront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The philosophy is, 'No weapons. Don't confront. Call the police,'&quot; Dorival said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that was her last dealings with the neighborhood, which chose its own leaders and had no sanctioning or accrediting relationship with law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Sheriff's Association said Wednesday it has &quot;no information indicating the community where the incident occurred has ever even registered with the NSA Neighborhood Watch program.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do not confront!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excerpts from Neighborhood Watch manuals:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* 'What you will not do is get physically involved with any activity you report or apprehension of any suspicious persons. This is the job of the law enforcement agency.' -- Sanford (city where Trayvon&nbsp;Martin slaying occurred)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* 'Neighborhood Watch is an observe and report type of program. Neighborhood Watch members are encouraged not to stop and question people, but to observe and report their observations to the sheriff's office and a trained officer will respond and investigate the incident.' -- Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* 'It should be emphasized to members that they do not possess police powers and they shall not carry weapons or pursue vehicles. They should also be cautioned to alert police or deputies when encountering strange activity. Members should never confront suspicious persons who could be armed and dangerous.' --National Sheriff's Association</SPAN></P>
