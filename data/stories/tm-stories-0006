<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A shotgun-toting man kicked in a church door during Sunday services before being disarmed by congregants who saw the armed man coming through the church windows, locked the doors, and sprang on him after he burst inside, sheriff's deputies said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one was hurt at the Southside Freewill Baptist Church in Boiling Springs, a community in Spartanburg County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputies charged Jesse Gates, 38, with burglary, disturbing a place of worship, and attempted kidnapping.

Tony Ivey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gates told reporters as he was led away in handcuffs to a patrol car taking him to jail that his children had been taken away and he was trying to get someone to listen to him. Gates said he asked the church for help, but was frustrated.</SPAN></P>
