<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami Gardens, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They called him Slimm.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is what Sybrina Fulton, the mother of the slain Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, told me people called her son because he was so thin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I talked with her Saturday in a restaurant near her home, four weeks to the day after George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., shot Trayvon in the chest and killed him. Trayvon was unarmed, carrying nothing more than candy and a drink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Fulton brought her own mother with her, Trayvon's grandmother, and we talked for nearly an hour over iced tea and lukewarm coffee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother lights up when she shows me pictures of Trayvon on her phone, even managing an occasional smile that lifts the shadow of grief and brightens her face. He was a gangly boy, all arms and legs but little weight, nearly six feet three inches tall but only 140 pounds and with the cherubic face of a boy years younger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She grows distant when she talks about her loss, occasionally, seemingly involuntarily, wrapping her hands gently around her mother's arm and resting her head on her mother's shoulder like a young girl in need of comfort. The sorrow seems to come in waves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She and her mother paint a portrait of an all-American boy, one anyone would be proud to call his or her own. He liked sports -- playing and watching -- and going to the mall with his friends. The meal his mother made that he liked most was hamburgers and French fries. ''And brownies,'' his grandmother chimed in, ''with lots of nuts.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was a smart boy who had taken advanced English and math classes, and he planned to go to college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was a hard worker who earned extra money by painting houses, and washing cars and working in the concession of the Pee Wee football league on the weekends. He also baby-sat for his younger cousins, two adorable little girls ages 3 and 7, whom the family called the bunnies, and when he watched the girls he baked them cookies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only fight his mother could ever recall his having was with his own brother when Trayvon was about 4 and the brother was 8. They were fighting for her attention, and it wasn't even a real fight. ''They were wrestling. It was so funny,'' she said with a smile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This hardly fits the profile of a menacing teen who would attack a grown man unprovoked, but that is exactly what Zimmerman contends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's statement, as related by police, says he was following the boy but ''he had lost sight of Trayvon and was returning to his truck to meet the police officer when he says he was attacked by Trayvon.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's personal account of who initiated the physical encounter is forever lost to the grave, but the initiation is likely to be the central question in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To believe Zimmerman's scenario, you have to believe that Trayvon, an unarmed boy, a boy so thin that people called him Slimm, a boy whose mother said that he had not had a fight since he was a preschooler, chose that night and that man to attack. You have to believe that Trayvon chose to attack a man who outweighed him by 100 pounds and who, according to the Sanford police, was wearing his gun in a holster. You have to believe that Trayvon chose to attack even though he was less than a hundred yards from the safety of the home where he was staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is possible, but hardly sounds plausible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key is to determine who was standing his ground and defending himself: the boy with the candy or the man with the gun. Who was winning the fight is a secondary question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, we'll have to wait for details of the investigation to be revealed to know for sure. But while we wait, it is important to not let Trayvon the person be lost to Trayvon the symbol. He was a real boy with a real family that really loved him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now he is gone from his mother forever, only able to stare out at her as a shining face on a cellphone. She has no home videos of Trayvon. She doesn't even have voicemail messages from him saved. The only way that she could now hear Trayvon's voice would be to call his phone and listen to his answering message, but she dare not do it. ''If I hear his voice, I think I'm going to scream.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every night she says she dreams of him. Every morning she says she thinks he's going to walk through the door and say, ''Mom, I'm here. You were dreaming. It's not true. I'm not dead. I'm here,'' and give her a hug and a kiss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the bunnies -- they still don't understand where he is. They're still asking for Trayvon, the cousin who came over and baked them cookies.</SPAN></P>
