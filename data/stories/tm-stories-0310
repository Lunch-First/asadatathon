</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police chief and a Florida state prosecutor overseeing the case of an unarmed black teenager shot dead by a neighbourhood watch captain stepped aside Thursday following withering criticism and national outrage that police have declined to arrest the shooter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee's resignation - which he called &quot;temporary&quot; - failed to appease civil rights and community leaders, who are calling for the arrest of watch captain George Zimmerman, 28, who shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin and claimed self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee was under mounting pressure for days and suffered a a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote from the city commission on Wednesday. The shakeup at the state level was more surprising, as Gov. Rick Scott replaced Tallahassee's lead investigator, State Attorney Norman Wolfinger, and formed a task force to review Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said this law, which allows people to use deadly force when they perceive danger in any public place, prevented them from arresting Zimmerman, a white Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coupled with at least two prior cases that stoked black anger toward the police, the response to the Martin episode had grown so intense Lee said he had no option but to step aside as &quot;my involvement in the matter is overshadowing the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Feb. 26, Martin was returning to a gated community from a candy run at a convenience store when spotted by Zimmerman, who was carrying a licensed handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman called police to report a &quot;suspicious guy&quot; and followed him despite the dispatcher's advice not to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbours said they heard a scuffle, cries for help and then the shot that killed Martin.</SPAN></P>
