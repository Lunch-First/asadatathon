<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 26--The shooting death of a Florida teenager in February that attracted national attention prompted some Oklahomans to speak out about injustice toward minorities and racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of people gathered Sunday in Oklahoma City near NW 23 and Classen Boulevard to protest the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old boy who was fatally shot in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26 by a neighborhood watch volunteer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, George Zimmerman, 28, told police he shot Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has not been arrested or charged in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seeing this scenario, it hits home. Ethnic and racial injustice happens,&quot; said Jason Quaynor, 23, of Norman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quaynor, a senior English and writing major at the University of Oklahoma, said he participated in the protest to spread awareness about the shooting and other cases dealing with race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there have been questionable shootings in Oklahoma, including the fatal shooting of an 18-year-old black man by a police officer in Del City on March 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Dane Garrett Scott Jr. led officers on a short pursuit before crashing near Interstate 35 and SE 15 in Oklahoma City. The officer said Scott tried to leave the scene and fought with him over a gun. Friends and family question the officer's account of what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not just for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. It's for all their voices to be heard at the same time,&quot; Quaynor said. &quot;It's an opportunity to seek justice and be seen as equals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters held signs and chanted at the intersection, encouraging people to honk their horns for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Martin was unarmed, wearing a hoodie and carrying a bag of Skittles and iced tea when he was shot. To pay tribute to the teen, some protesters wore similar clothing and had bags of the candy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group also had a banner with Martin's picture that read &quot;Justice for Trayvon. Am I next?&quot; Protesters took turns signing the banner until it was nearly full of signatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle Petties, 36, of Oklahoma City, stood nearby with her young daughters. Each of them held signs about Martin and their own rights as bi-racial Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petties said her daughters should be able to exist in a society with the same rights as everyone else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time for a change,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
