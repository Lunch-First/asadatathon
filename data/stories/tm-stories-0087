<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Churchgoers across America attended services wearing hoodies yesterday in a show of solidarity for a black teenager whose fatal shooting in Florida by a white Hispanic man has prompted a civil rights uproar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preachers also wore hoodies in pulpits, symbolising support for the growing calls for justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old killed on an errand to buy sweets for his younger brother by a Neighbourhood Watch captain who deemed him &quot;suspicious&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are doing this not for show, but to send a message that all humanity is sacred,&quot; said the Rev Raphael Warnock, of Ebenezer Baptist Church, in Atlanta, Georgia, who was among the tens of thousands who joined protests yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civic officials in Sanford, where Trayvon was shot dead on February 26 while visiting his father, appealed for &quot;calm heads and no vigilante justice&quot; after the announcement by the New Black Panther Party, a militant black vigilante group, of a $10,000 (&pound;6,300) bounty for the capture of George Zimmerman, 28. Police have refused to arrest him for the shooting after he claimed that he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party issued a call on Saturday for 10,000 men to help it to hunt down and capture Mr Zimmerman, who has gone into hiding in fear of his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Miami, where Trayvon lived with his mother, students at 19 schools walked out of class on Friday to protest that no action had been taken against Mr Zimmerman, and more demonstrations are expected today. Rallies demanding justice for Trayvon were held in several cities at the weekend and in Sanford a Prayer for Peace event was organised by city officials for last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Miami Heat basketball team showed support by publishing a photograph of themselves with their heads bowed, all wearing hoodies. An online petition calling on Florida's Attorney-General to prosecute Mr Zimmerman has received nearly two million signatures.</SPAN></P>
