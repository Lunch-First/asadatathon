South Carolina bill would remove a right to deadly force
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - A newly proposed bill in South Carolina would remove a legal protection giving people the right to use deadly force. 
Denmark Rep. Bakari Sellers said Thursday he wants to remove the "stand your ground" provision from the state law that deals with personal property protections. Sellers' bill would strike language saying someone who isn't breaking the law and is somewhere he has the right to be, like where he works, has the right to use deadly force to protect himself or someone else.
The provision became law in 2006.
Sellers said he was inspired to introduce the bill after the death of Trayvon Martin. The black Florida teenager was shot to death by a Hispanic neighborhood watch captain who has not been charged and said he shot in self-defense.
