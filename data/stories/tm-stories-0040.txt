Senior Obama adviser David Plouffe said Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich's comments about the president's reaction to the killing of African American teenager TrayvonMartin were "reprehensible" and "hard to stomach." Gingrich criticized President Obama for injecting race into the incident when Obama said "if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon" at a news conference last week. But during his appearance on "State of the Union," Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) boldly stated that "we all know there is a racial component" in the shooting of the unarmed Florida teen by a neighborhood watch volunteer. On "This Week," Plouffe added that: "Speaker Gingrich is clearly in the last throes of his political career ... You can make a decision whether to go out with some shred of dignity or say these irresponsible, reckless things. And he's clearly chosen the latter."
