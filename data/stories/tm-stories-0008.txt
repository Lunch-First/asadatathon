Washington Post, Saturday March 24
White House officials almost certainly knew President Barack Obama would be asked about the Trayvon Martin shooting soon. 
The case has stirred immense passion nationwide because of its racial element: Martin, who was unarmed, was killed by George Zimmerman, 28, a Hispanic neighbourhood watch volunteer, who told police that he shot the black teenager in self-defence. Zimmerman has not been charged over Martin's death.
Obama did not deal with the details of the incident, discussing the racially charged incident with deep emotion without saying the words "black" or "race". Obama's new approach is at once deeply personal and completely universal, and avidly avoids taking sides in a political fight.
His appeal on Friday was to the parents. "I can only imagine what these parents are going through," he said.
"And I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pulls together - federal, state and local - to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened."
Embedded in his remarks in the Rose Garden was a particular message about being a black parent. "If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon," Obama said. "When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids."
