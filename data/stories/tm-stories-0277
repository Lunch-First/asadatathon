<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No arrests have been made following the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in a Sanford suburb on February 26. Protesters held placards with pictures of shooter George Zimmerman alongside slogans such as &quot;arrest and indict this SOB now&quot; and &quot;Fake cop.&quot; Others read: &quot;100 years of lynching, justifiable homicide.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Same thing&quot; and &quot;Pray, protest, but get armed.&quot; Mr Zimmerman insists that he had acted in self-defence. Veteran civil rights activists Al Sharpton told the rally: &quot;We want permanent justice - we want Zimmerman in court with his hands cuffed behind his back.&quot; Hundreds of US citizens took to popular social media sites Facebook and Twitter in hooded sweatshirts on Thursday in solidarity with the Martin family. People changed their profile pictures and tweeted photos of themselves wearing hoodies, many posing the question: &quot;Do I look suspicious?&quot; or using the Twitter hashtag &quot;IAmTrayvonMartin.&quot; Former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm and Children's Defence Fund head Marian Wright Edelman joined the grouping, which included everyone from grandmothers to a group of law students from Howard University. Ms Granholm said: &quot;The hoodie is a way of expressing support for the Martin family, and for all the sons of African-American families who bear the heavy burden of other people's negative assumptions.&quot; Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, who has been lambasted for not arresting Mr Zimmerman, announced that he was temporarily stepping down on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
