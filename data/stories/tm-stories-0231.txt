TAMPA A local Facebook group is organizing a rally today in protest over officials' handling of the Trayvon Martin case.
"Real Talk: Real Answers," a group of about 100 members, says the peaceful rally at Al Lopez Park is in support of the Justice for Tray movement and is modeled after the recent "Million Hoodie March" in New York City.
The group says the public is welcome and encourages protesters to wear hoodies, and bring posters and signs.
Participants will meet at 10:30 a.m. at the park, 4010 N. Himes Ave., then proceed at 11 a.m. to North Dale Mabry Highway at Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard.
The gathering is expected to last until 1 p.m.
The demonstration is among several across the country related to Martin, a Miami Gardens 17-year-old who was fatally shot while walking to his father's Sanford home from a convenience store by a neighborhood watch volunteer.
The shooting has sparked national outrage because no criminal charges have been filed against the shooter, George Zimmerman.
