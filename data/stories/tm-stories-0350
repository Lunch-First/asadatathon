<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unarmed black teenager shot to death by a neighbourhood watch volunteer in Florida told his girlfriend he was being followed shortly before the confrontation that killed him, a lawyer said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has sparked protests and drawn attention to the growing number of American states that allow people to use deadly force if they feel threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, 28, says he shot 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last month in self-defence during a confrontation in a Florida community. He has not been charged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was returning home from a trip to a convenience store carrying only a bag of Skittles and a bottle of iced tea. Since it was raining, he wore a hooded top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A phone call that recorded Martin&quot;s final moments was disclosed as the US Justice Department opened a federal civil rights probe into the February 27 shooting and the local prosecutor convened a grand jury to investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil rights division, with the FBI, will attempt to establish how detectives concluded that a slight, 17-year-old boy represented a mortal threat to his stocky killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin&quot;s parents are doggedly campaigning for a proper investigation into the shooting. His mother, Sybrina Fulton, appeared on television on Tuesday to allege that her son was killed because Zimmerman was: &quot;reacting to the colour of his skin&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represents Martin&quot;s parents, said the teenager was on the phone with his girlfriend when he told her he was being followed. Martin told the girl he&quot;d taken shelter from the rain briefly at an apartment building before continuing his walk to where he was staying with his father nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He says, &quot;Oh, he&quot;s right behind me, he&quot;s right behind me again&quot;,&quot; Crump says the girl told him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She says, &quot;Run&quot;, he says, &quot;I&quot;m not going to run, I&quot;m just going to walk fast.&quot; She hears Trayvon say, &quot;Why are you following me?&quot; Other voice says, &quot;What are you doing around here?&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told Crump they both repeated themselves and then she thinks she heard Zimmerman push Martin &quot;because his voice changes like something interrupted his speech.&quot; She heard an altercation and then the phone call was cut off. She didn&quot;t hear the gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say Zimmerman was bleeding from his nose and the back of his head, and told police he had yelled out for help before he shot Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump said yesterday that it was Martin who cried out when a man bearing a 9mm handgun came at him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She absolutely blows Zimmerman&quot;s absurd self-defence claim out of the water,&quot; Crump said of Martin&quot;s girlfriend, whose name was withheld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin called his 16-year-old girlfriend in Miami several times on February 27, Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin&quot;s father discovered the lengthy conversations by checking his son&quot;s cellphone log, Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last call was at 7.12pm local time. Police arrived at 7.17pm to find Martin lying face down on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was handcuffed after police arrived and taken into custody for questioning, but was released by police without being charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not rest until he is arrested,&quot; Crump said. &quot;The more time that passes, this is going to be swept under the rug.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer said he planned to turn over information about the call to federal investigators; a grand jury is also likely to subpoena the records. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is also involved in the state case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has ignited a furore against the local police department of this Orlando suburb of 53,500 people, sparking rallies and a protest in Governor Rick Scott&quot;s office yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department&quot;s Civil Rights Division plans to send its community relations service to Sanford to &quot;address tension in the community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a town hall meeting, more than 350 people packed into the Allen Chapel AME Church in a traditionally black neighbourhood of Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders urged residents to remain calm but demand Zimmerman be arrested. They also said the town&quot;s police chief should step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities may be limited by a state law that allows people to defend themselves with deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida was the first state to pass in 2005 a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which has been dubbed a &quot;Shoot First&quot; law by gun control advocates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About half of all US states now had similar laws, said Brian Malte, legislative director of the Brady Campaign, described as the nation&quot;s largest organisation dedicated to the prevention of gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;THIS GUY LOOKS LIKE HE&quot;S UP TO NO GOOD&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman had followed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin despite being advised not to by a police operator. Zimmerman can be heard on emergency tape calling police to report a suspicious character where he lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy looks like he&quot;s up to no good, or he&quot;s on drugs or something,&quot; he tells the dispatcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These arseholes, they always get away,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman tells the operator that he is following Martin, after which the operator tells him not to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second 911 call, this time from a neighbour who witnessed a struggle between the two men, could also prove crucial to any future investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighbour says she can hear &quot;someone screaming outside&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don&quot;t know why. I think they&quot;re yelling help but I don&quot;t know,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sound of a struggle can be heard, followed by gunshots.</SPAN></P>
