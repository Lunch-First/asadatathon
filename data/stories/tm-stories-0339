<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 22--So far, Kansas has been fortunate to avoid an incident similar to the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that case, 28-year-old George Zimmerman followed an unarmed Martin, whom he described as &quot;suspicious,&quot; through Zimmerman's gated community. Despite assurances from 911 officials that the police had been dispatched, Zimmerman continued his pursuit. The two got into a dispute after Martin removed his cell phone from his pocket, and Zimmerman fired a fatal shot into Martin's chest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And thanks to Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, Zimmerman so far hasn't been arrested or charged in the incident, although the case will be reviewed by a Florida grand jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kansas law is similar to Florida's, stating that any person has the right to stand his ground at any place he has a right to be. Before legislators altered the law in 2010, it contained a &quot;duty to retreat&quot; provision, which required an initial attempt to leave a volatile situation before resorting to deadly force -- with an exception for a person's private property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local officials view Florida's case as a rarity and express little concern about the implications of Kansas law. Nevertheless, Kansas would do well to re-evaluate its own law to prevent a similar tragedy here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right to stand one's ground shouldn't extend to the right to pursue someone who hasn't committed a crime, nor should it give people the right to initiate a confrontation and hide behind the law to avoid prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's death in Florida was inexcusable and completely unnecessary, and it was caused in part by a flawed law that allows people to determine what ground is theirs and a subjective interpretation of what is legally a legitimate threat.</SPAN></P>
