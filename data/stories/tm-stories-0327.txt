Harry Potter actor jailed over riots
LONDON. A London court has sentenced a star of the Harry Potter films to two years in prison after he admitted to taking part in last year's London riots. 
Jamie Waylett, 22, who played school bully Vincent Crabbe in six of the films, was found guilty of violent disorder by a jury at London's Wood Green Crown Court after earlier admitting to stealing a bottle of champagne from a supermarket.
The actor, from Hampstead in north London, was part of a mob of youths who joined in as the riots swept through Chalk Farm in north London on August 8 last year.
Waylett, who already has a previous conviction for cannabis possession, was cleared of intending to destroy or damage property with a petrol bomb he was seen to be holding.
