<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's personal: Obama Shooter in hiding By GUY ADAMS in Los Angeles A rally in Los Angeles calls for justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, who was murdered by a neighbourhood vigilante. Photo: REUTERS US PRESIDENT Barack Obama has stepped into the growing controversy over the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, telling a news conference that America has some &quot;soul searching&quot; to do over the killing of the unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President, who previously described Trayvon's death as a &quot;local issue,&quot; said yesterday that he empathised with the parents of the boy, who was shot last month by a neighbourhood vigilante in suburban Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son he'd look like Trayvon. They are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves and that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama's decision to speak out about Trayvon's killing, in such personal terms, represents a calculated gamble. Although the case has sparked international outrage, it also risks widening racial divides in an election year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, who was 17 and had no criminal record, was shot on February 26 as he walked from a convenience store to the home of his father's girlfriend, in a gated community in the commuter town of Sanford, just outside Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police did not arrest his killer, a local vigilante called George Zimmerman, apparently accepting at face value that he had acted in self- defence, and claiming that a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law enacted in Florida at the behest of the gun lobby would prevent his successful prosecution. In the aftermath of the killing, it has emerged that they discounted the evidence of several witnesses, and misleadingly told the media that Mr Zimmerman, 28, was a &quot;squeaky clean&quot; individual with no criminal record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It subsequently emerged that he had a previous arrest for battery and had been accused of domestic violence. In the past year, he had called emergency services almost 50 times to complain about &quot;suspicious persons&quot; in his neighbourhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of them turned out to be black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his 911 call on the night of Trayvon's death, he appeared to use a racial slur to describe his eventual victim as a &quot;f---ing coon&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he was never asked why he used a 9mm pistol to ward off a child who weighed at least 45kilograms less than him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford's chief of police has resigned, pending a review of his department, which has faced widespread accusations of racial bias in this and several other cases. Mr Zimmerman, who was described by police as a &quot;white male&quot; but claims to be Hispanic, is now in hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his remarks, Mr Obama suggested that Trayvon's death ought to prompt states such as Florida to reconsider &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws, which have led to scores of murder cases being abandoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative to investigate every aspect of this and that everybody pulls together - federal, state and local - to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened,&quot; he said. &quot;I think all of us have to do some soul searching ... And that means we examine the laws, the context for what happened, as well as the specifics of the incident.&quot; Independent</SPAN></P>
