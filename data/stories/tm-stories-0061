<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Manhattan worshippers yesterday joined churchgoers across America in donning hoodies to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed black teen blown away by a Florida cop wannabe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Middle Collegiate Church in the East Village was filled to capacity - with almost everyone in the racially mixed audience wearing hoodies such as the one Martin had on when he was shot,  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We are all in hoodies today to say, 'I'm not dangerous - racism is,' &quot; said Minister Jacqui Lewis. &quot;Every Sunday, I'm going to wear my hoodie until justice is done.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Martin, 17, was killed Feb. 26 in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., by volunteer neighborhood-watch captain George Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The teen had left his dad's girlfriend's house in the neighborhood to buy Skittles and a can of iced tea at a local store before the NBA All-Star game started on TV. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   At Hartford Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit, the Rev. Charles Adams approached the pulpit with iced tea and Skittles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Mr. Zimmerman was so worried about burglars that he became a thief that stole a human life,&quot; Adams said, according to the Detroit News. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Florida cops so far have refused to arrest Zimmerman, buying his self-defense claim. State and federal prosecutors are looking into the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A witness to the shooting's aftermath said Zimmerman did nothing to help Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We heard the gunshot, [and my roommate and I] both saw him straddling the body, basically a foot on both sides of Trayvon's body, and his hands pressed on his back,&quot; Mary Cutcher told NBC's &quot;Dateline'' in an interview aired last night.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Zimmerman never turned him over or tried to help him or [administer] CPR or anything.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, another neighbor, Frank Taaffe, insisted Zimmerman never acted like &quot;Charles Bronson or Rambo'' around the community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He wasn't Bernhard Goetz trying to jump on the subway looking for trouble,'' Taaffe said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Referring to TV's &quot;Andy Griffith Show,'' about small-town cops, Taaffe added, &quot;George was a cross between Barney Fife and Andy of Maybury.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman's lawyer insisted his client was only protecting himself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;George Zimmerman suffered a broken nose, an injury - a gash - to the back of his head,&quot; said lawyer Craig Sonner. &quot;He claims that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin struck him, and he went down.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even the Florida rep who wrote the state's &quot;Stand Your Ground'' law, which Zimmerman is using to defend himself, did not appear convinced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the &quot;Dateline'' reporter noted that &quot;trained police investigators . . . determined no crime was committed [by Zimmerman],'' Republican legislator Dennis Baxley replied, &quot;I think they're wrong.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman has been in hiding. A friend said the shooter cried for days after the deadly incident. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He couldn't stop crying. He's a caring human being,&quot; said the pal, former TV news reporter Joe Oliver. &quot;I mean, he took a man's life, and he has no idea what to do about it. He's extremely remorseful about it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
