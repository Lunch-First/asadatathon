The US Justice Department has opened an investigation into the shooting of a black teenager in Sanford, Florida, by a neighbourhood watch captain following mounting public pressure including an international Twitter campaign.  
On February 26, Trayvon Martin, 17, was shot dead by George Zimmerman, who was patrolling a gated community in his car.
Mr Zimmerman had spotted Mr Martin walking home from buying candy. He called police and reported what he described  a real suspicious guy . 
Mr Martin was shot dead after Mr Zimmerman confronted the teenager, despite police telling him not to approach nor follow the 17-year-old.  
But police, citing Florida s controversial  Stand Your Ground  law, declined to arrest Zimmerman, and turned the case over to prosecutors, where it remained under review.
However, following public outcry over the killing, the Justice Department s Civil Rights Division and the FBI have confirmed they are to open an investigation into the shooting. 
It came after more than 435,000 people, many alerted by tweets from celebrities including movie director Spike Lee, musician Wyclef Jean, and actress Mia Farrow signed a petition on Change.org, a social action website, which called for the arrest of Mr Zimmerman.
Campaigners are also calling for the repeal of the Stand Your Ground law, which is in effect in at least 16 other states. 
The law, enacted by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in 2005, allows a potential crime victim  in fear of great bodily injury  to use deadly force in public places, and builds upon legislation that permits the use of deadly force in defense of  hearth and home .
In 2010, a review by Florida s St Petersburg Times found that reports of justifiable homicides had tripled since 2005.
