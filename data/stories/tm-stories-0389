<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin was returning from a trip to the convenience store carrying only a bag of Skittles and a bottle of iced tea when a neighbourhood vigilante approached him in a gated Florida community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later, the unarmed black teenager was lying fatally injured in the grass, in a shooting that has sparked growing outrage and accusations of institutional racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly a month after the incident, the alleged gunman - 28-yearold George Zimmerman - has not been arrested, let alone charged, shielded by a Florida law protecting gun owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As details of Trayvon's death on 26 February have been pieced together by US news outlets, public outrage has steadily mounted, and late on Monday, the US Justice Department agreed to open an investigation into the death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the run-up to the fatal incident, Mr Zimmerman had repeatedly called emergency services to report everything from open garage doors to &quot;suspicious persons&quot; in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something,&quot; Mr Zimmerman told 911. &quot;These a**holes, they always get away.&quot; Then, against the advice of an operator, decided to confront Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ensuing altercation, several neighbours heard cries for help, followed by the sound of the fatal gunshot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police declined to make an arrest after Mr Zimmerman claimed that he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim's girlfriend revealed yesterday that she had been speaking to him on his phone before the attack. &quot;Why are you following me?&quot; she heard him ask Mr Zimmerman. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; came the reply. After that, his phone was apparently thrown to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A petition calling for Mr Zimmerman''s prosecution has attracted more than 550,000 signatures and was endorsed by a slew of left-leaning celebrities, including Spike Lee, Wyclef Jean, and Mia Farrow.</SPAN></P>
