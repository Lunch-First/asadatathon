<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior Obama adviser David Plouffe said Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich's comments about the president's reaction to the killing of African American teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin were &quot;reprehensible&quot; and &quot;hard to stomach.&quot; Gingrich criticized President Obama for injecting race into the incident when Obama said &quot;if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon&quot; at a news conference last week. But during his appearance on &quot;State of the Union,&quot; Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) boldly stated that &quot;we all know there is a racial component&quot; in the shooting of the unarmed Florida teen by a neighborhood watch volunteer. On &quot;This Week,&quot; Plouffe added that: &quot;Speaker Gingrich is clearly in the last throes of his political career ... You can make a decision whether to go out with some shred of dignity or say these irresponsible, reckless things. And he's clearly chosen the latter.&quot; </SPAN></P>
