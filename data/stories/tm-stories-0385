</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After mounting public outrage over the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old black teenager by a crime-watch volunteer, a grand jury will consider whether the 28-year-old shooter, George Zimmerman, should be charged.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Zimmerman wasn't arrested in connection with the Feb. 26 shooting because he claimed self-defence and police in Sanford, near Orlando, said they had no evidence to dispute his version of events. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In announcing the grand jury Tuesday, Florida State Attorney Norm Wolfinger, shifted the decision-making in what has become a racially-charged case to ordinary citizens. His decision, a day after the FBI and U.S. Department of Justice also decided to open an investigation into the case, may defuse the mounting public anger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also emerged Tuesday that Mr. Martin was talking to friend on his cell phone as Mr. Zimmerman approached. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The call, disclosed by Ben Crump, a lawyer representing the Martin family, suggests the teenager was worried about the approaching Mr. Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;She knew details about what went on because he was telling her,&quot; Mr. Crump said. According to the lawyer, the girl said, &quot;I asked Trayvon to run, and he said he was going to walk fast. I told him to run, but he said he was not going to run,&quot; Phone records show the call between the two ended four minutes before police arrived to find Mr. Martin dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other calls to 911 recorded sounds of an altercation, then a gunshot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the fevered fears of critics who warned of gun battles at check-out counters and showdowns in parks haven't been realized, the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a gun-toting, crime watch volunteer has put the 'Stand Your Ground' law on public trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 2005 law swept aside the limits of a centuries-old legal principle that &quot;an Englishman's home is his castle&quot; and redefined when a citizen could kill another rather than back away from a confrontation. The so-called 'castle doctrine,' long part of English common law and fundamental to key elements of the U.S. Constitution, includes not only a 'right to defend' but also corresponding 'duty to retreat.' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other words, a citizen facing a threat in his home can use deadly force in self-defence. But the same right of self-defence - at least until Florida's law - didn't apply in public spaces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Backed by the powerful National Rifle Association and passed overwhelmingly by Florida's legislature, the 'Stand Your Ground' law allowed citizens to use lethal force in self-defence in almost all public spaces. They no longer had to back off from confrontations. There was no 'obligation to retreat' from confrontation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seventeen other states have since passed similar laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Martin's death has focused public attention on the sweeping new scope of using lethal force in self defence. But it wasn't the first. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Orlando Sentinel has cited a handful. One was the shooting death of an unarmed man in a park near Tampa in a dispute over skateboarding rules. A judge is currently considering whether the shooter merely 'stood his ground.' </SPAN></P>
