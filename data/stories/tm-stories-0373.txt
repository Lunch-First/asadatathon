 CIVIL rights leaders in the US have demanded the arrest of a neighbourhood watch helper who went free after shooting dead an unarmed black teenager. The FBI is now investigating the incident in Florida, following a public outcry.  
 And at a public meeting in the town of Sanford where 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot last month, officials from the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and the Nation of Islam urged residents to remain calm but demand that the shooter, George Zimmerman, be arrested. Mr Zimmerman has not been charged in the February 26 shooting and has said he shot Mr Martin, who was returning to a gated community after buying sweets at a convenience store, in self-defence after Martin attacked him.
