<b>HEAT ADD VOICES TO SHOOTING PROTEST
 NBA:</b> LeBron James and Dwyane Wade were among several Miami players who took the floor against the Detroit Pistons at Auburn Hills, Mich., with messages on their sneakers about the death of an unarmed black teenager who was shot by a neighborhood crime-watch volunteer in a suburb of Orlando, Fla. The Heat made quick work of the Pistons in an 88-73 victory, but the focus afterward was on the team's decision to speak out.
 Miami also posed for a picture earlier in the day wearing team-logo hoodies. Trayvon Martin was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when he was shot last month.
 "As leaders, as role models, we're happy that we're able to shed light on a situation that we feel isn't right," James said. "That's why we did that today."
 The game also marked the Heat debut of former Gonzaga University star Ronny Turiaf, who was with the Washington Wizards when he broke his hand in January and had not played since. The Wizards traded Turiaf last week to Denver, which waived him on Sunday. He then signed as a free agent with Miami.
 Turiaf played 11 minutes and scored four points and grabbed four rebounds.
