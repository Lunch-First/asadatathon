</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Rick Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi have appointed a special prosecutor to take over the investigation of the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, responding to increased pressure from national civil rights leaders outraged over the killing of the unarmed, black 17-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott appointed State Attorney Angela Corey of Jacksonville as special prosecutor on the same day beleaguered Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee temporarily stepped down after being bitterly criticized for not arresting George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot Martin and claimed self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott also appointed a task force to look into the state's first-in-the-nation &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which allows individuals to use deadly force when they feel threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott's actions came two days after he met with a group of 50 black lawyers and civil rights activists who asked for a special prosecutor and a task force on racial profiling, which they said was at the heart of the Martin shooting and behind many other &quot;stand your ground&quot; defenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the governor's announcement came the day after several Democratic black state lawmakers asked him to remove Seminole County State Attorney Norman Wolfinger, whom they accused of being too close to Lee and the sheriff's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmakers hailed Scott's swift response. &quot;This will temporarily prevent the powder keg from exploding right now, because the black community will feel that at least there will be somebody who will give a good look to see if Mr. Zimmerman committed a crime,&quot; said Sen. Gary Siplin, D-Orlando, whose district abuts Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to Scott agreeing to turn over the Martin case, Wolfinger said he was stepping aside &quot;in the interest of public safety&quot; and to &quot;avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Thursday, Lee announced he was temporarily stepping down to let passions cool. His decision came after a split city commission gave him a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote. Lee has said evidence in the case supported Zimmerman's claim that the Feb. 26 shooting of Martin was self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights groups have held rallies in Florida and New York, saying the shooting was unjustified. Al Sharpton and the slain teen's family addressed a fiery crowd of about 1,000 supporters Thursday in downtown Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want an arrest, we want a conviction and we want him sentenced for the murder of my son,&quot; said Martin's father, Tracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department and FBI have opened a civil rights investigation. Wolfinger had scheduled a grand jury to convene April 10 to determine whether to charge Zimmerman. That grand jury is still scheduled to meet, but not under Wolfinger's supervision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott said the task force looking into the 2005 law would be headed by Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll, who is black, and the Rev. R.B. Holmes Jr., a Tallahassee civil rights icon and pastor of the Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we exercise our right to be free and secure both in public and in the privacy of our own homes, it is important that we have an open and honest discussion on these issues, so that we might help avoid such tragedies in the future,&quot; Scott said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Oscar Braynon, who represents the South Florida district where Martin lived with his mother, said he hopes to be appointed to the panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These steps are the kinds of steps we need to take to get that justice that everybody's rallying about as we speak,&quot; said Braynon, D-Miami Gardens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Miramar, said the shooting confirmed his &quot;greatest fear&quot; about the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law: &quot;This law is a license to kill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Plantation, said on his Facebook page that Zimmerman &quot;should have been held in custody and certainly should not be walking free, still having a concealed weapons carry permit. From my reading, it seems this young man was pursued and there was no probable cause to engage him, certainly not pursue and shoot him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
