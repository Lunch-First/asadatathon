<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- Dozens of men and women gathered outside Oakland City Hall on Monday to add their voices to those across the nation demanding the arrest and prosecution of the man who shot black Florida teenager Trayvon Martin one month ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of those who rallied wore &quot;hoodies&quot; similar to the sweatshirt that the 17-year-old Martin was wearing when George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, shot and killed him following a confrontation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 28, said he acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Martin's family said the unarmed teenager was a victim of profiling, prompting a national outcry and debate on race that has stretched from the White House to Frank H. Ogawa Plaza and elsewhere in the Bay Area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His life was robbed because of suspicion and perception,&quot; Dr. Charley Hames, pastor of BeeBe Memorial Cathedral in Oakland, said at the Oakland rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with wearing hoodies, some protesters brought Skittles candy and cans of iced tea. Martin was carrying the items when he was shot as he headed back from a convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It reminds me of Emmett Till,&quot; said Sharlana Turner, 25, of Berkeley, referring to the African-American boy who was murdered in Mississippi in August 1955. &quot;It's a continuing cycle of no justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was heading to a grocery store in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26 when he spotted Martin and called police to report him as suspicious. Zimmerman stepped out of his SUV to follow Martin, despite a police dispatcher discouraging him, according to published reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told police that he briefly lost sight of Martin and was returning to his vehicle when the teenager confronted and attacked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kareem Marshall, 25, of Berkeley, said the murder of his mother, Pearla Ann Louis, in May 2010 made him empathize with the Martin family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the same pain,&quot; Marshall said. &quot;They have lost someone to violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, whose father is white and mother is Hispanic, was not arrested after the shooting due to Florida's personal protection laws. Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law allows people to use deadly force in self-defense, which is why authorities have so far not charged Zimmerman. Similar laws are in effect in at least 23 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State and federal authorities are still investigating the case, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This young teenager was gunned down because of how he looked, because of the color of his skin,&quot; Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, said Monday. &quot;We need to see justice in this case immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congressional Black Caucus will lead briefings on Capitol Hill this week on hate crimes and racial profiling, Lee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While this issue has shocked American culture, it hasn't shocked me,&quot; Lee said. &quot;The combination of the powerful gun lobby, racial profiling and hate crimes make this local matter one of national attention. Sanford could be anywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oakland protest was just one of many that have taken place throughout the country since Martin's death. It is believed to have been the first in the East Bay, although several people also demonstrated Monday outside the San Francisco Hall of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesha Monge-Irizarry, whose son Idriss Stelley was fatally shot by San Francisco police in 2001, said, &quot;We're tired of saying 'no more stolen lives.' Now it's time for action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests also took place over the weekend in Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Columbia, S.C.</SPAN></P>
