Amar'e Stoudemire arrived at Air Canada Centre in a sweater with a  hood raised over his head and when he took the court for pregame  warm-ups, he wore a Knicks hoodie, the hood again over his head.    
  Stoudemire wanted to show his support for the protests in the wake  of the fatal shooting of TrayvonMartin last month by a community  watchman. Part of the reasoning for the shooting was that the  17-year-old was threatening because he was wearing a hoodie.   
    "I mean, it's just a matter of us understanding that we all have to  be positive influences on the community," said Stoudemire, who grew  up in Orlando, just 20 minutes from Sanford, Fla., where the  shooting occurred. "If you're going to be a watchman, be a positive  watchman in the community. I think it's all about uplifting the  community and keeping everybody together for a positive message."   
    Florida state representative Alan Williams sent out a request via  twitter to Stoudemire, along with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and  Chris Paul to wear hoodies during warm-ups at their games. But  Stoudemire said he had not seen that and chose to do this on his  own.   
    Stoudemire posted a photo on his Twitter account, @Amareisreal,  wearing a sweater with a hood and declaring that he had his hoodie  on. Carmelo Anthony also posted a photo of himself wearing one with  the words, "I am TrayvonMartin." Wade posted a photo of himself  with a hoodie and spoke out about it, and James then posted a Heat  team photo with the entire group wearing hoodies.
