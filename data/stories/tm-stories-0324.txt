March 23--NEW YORK -- From a group shot with Miami Heat players ... all of them dressed in black hoodie sweatshirts to the New York Knicks' own Amar'e Stoudemire in own hoodie pic. 
This single piece of clothing -- and the stereotype that whoever is wearing one is suspicious -- has become a flashpoint in the case.
It's what Martin wore when he was shot and killed by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman in a gated community last month in Sanford, Florida.
Even President Obama is weighing in.
He empathized today with the slain 17-year old's grieving parents, saying" You know if i had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are gonna take this with the seriousness it deserves and get to the bottom of what happened."
To that end, rallies and vigils are happening more frequently with demonstrations growing in scale.
Students in several Florida high schools took to the streets today in a show of solidarity, pushing for an arrest - and criminal charges against Zimmerman.
So who is George Zimmerman?
He's a former altar boy, and passionate -- some would even say over zealous -- protector of his gated neighborhood in Sanford.
But remember this photo Zimmerman? It's actually mug shot, from an arrest for pushing a Florida state alcohol agent who tried to arrest his friend - a bartender, accused of serving drinks to minors.
But Zimmerman got his act together, and by all accounts relished his role as a volunteer neighborhood watchman.
He says he shot TrayvonMartin in self-defense.
South Florida's black community as already weighed, but Zimmerman's lawyer, who claims the incident was not racially motivated. "The answer is absolutely not. George is friends with people in the African-American community, said attorney Craig Sonner."
