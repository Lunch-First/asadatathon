<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 25--An Iraqi-American woman who used to live in Dearborn was found beaten to death at her home near San Diego in what might possibly be a hate crime. A note calling her a terrorist and saying she should go back to her country was left next to her body, according to friends and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death on Saturday of Shaima Alawadi, 32, after three days in the hospital has prompted an intense outpouring of anxiety and outrage from some, especially among Arab-Americans and on social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. Some drew comparisons with the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an African-American teen shot dead last month in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm really disturbed,&quot; said Suehaila Amen, president of the Lebanese-American Heritage Club in Dearborn. &quot;It's quite frightening.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body of Alawadi, a U.S. citizen, is currently being prepared to be flown to Iraq for her funeral, said Imam Husham Al-Husainy, of the Karbalaa Islamic Education Center in Dearborn. Her father, Sayed Nabeel Alawadi, is a Shia cleric in Iraq, whose government will pay for shipping expenses of the body, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is outraged,&quot; Al-Husainy told the Free Press. &quot;This is too evil, too criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police told the San Diego Union-Tribune they are investigating her death in El Cajon, near San Diego, as a homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A hate crime is one of the possibilities, and we will be looking at that,&quot; Lt. Mark Coit of El Cajon police told the Union-Tribune. &quot;We don't want to focus on only one issue and miss something else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alawadi, a mother of five born in Iraq, was found by her 17-year-old daughter on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I found her on the floor...in her own blood with a letter next to hear head saying go back to your country you terrorist,&quot; Fatima Al Himidi, told 10News, a TV station serving the San Diego area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a week ago, the woman's family had received a separate, similar note that read:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're a terrorist. You should move back to your country,&quot; Hayder Al-Zayadi, a friend of the family, told the Free Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people are not educated,&quot; Al-Zayadi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alawadi was born in Iraq and moved to the U.S. in 1993 along with her family, part of a wave of Shia Muslim refugees who fled to metro Detroit after former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein cracked down on an uprising in 1991. After living in Dearborn for a few years, she moved to the San Diego area in 1996, graduated from high school, and was a housewife raising five kids at the time of her death, according to Al-Zayadi. El Cajon has a growing Iraqi-American population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's such a respectful person,&quot; he said. &quot;When she was in the hospital (after the beating), Christian, Muslim, Jewish, all nationalities, were there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her brothers worked as cultural advisers for the U.S. Army to help train soldiers who were deployed to the Middle East, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaima wore a hijab, an Islamic headscarf. When she received the earlier threatening note, she ignored it, assuming it was a harmless joke, her daughter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A week ago they left a letter saying this is our country not yours you terrorist, and so my mom ignored that thinking it was just kids playing a prank,&quot; she told the TV station. &quot;But the day they hit her, they left another note again, and it said the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of El Cajon has a growing Arab-American population. Last night in Arab-American communities, &quot;everybody was talking about&quot; the death of Alawadi, Amen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 33, Amen is roughly the same age as Alawadi and also wears a hijab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is something that's really scary,&quot; Amen said. &quot;For a woman like myself who wears a hijab, you're an open target. You're always looking over your shoulder because of how you're dressed and because someone might have skewed perceptions of the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On social media sites, people expressed concern she was killed because of her ethnicity and religion. Some compared her to Martin, the African-American teenager killed in Florida who was wearing a hoodie. They say that both were minorities killed, one for a hoodie, the other for a hijab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Facebook page was created Saturday called: &quot;One Million Hijabs for Shaima Alawadi.&quot; Hijabis is a term sometimes used by Muslims for women who wear hijabs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facebook page reads: &quot;She could be your daughter, your sister, your friend. We cannot let the children in this country grow up in a world so full of hatred that a woman wearing a head scarf is afraid for her life, that a black kid wearing a hoodie is afraid for his life... We are all Shaima. We need a Million Hijab March.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Facebook page, the words &quot;this oufit doesn't say 'kill me' on the label&quot; is on a photo of a woman wearing a hijab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaima's death drew a response from a range of people, including Rabbi Avraham Berkowitz, with the Orthodox Jewish group Chabad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wrote on Twitter this morning: &quot;Outrageous that this murder happened in the USA! May Shaima Alawadis murderer be found &amp; brought to justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Rieckhoff, the CEO of Iraq &amp; Afghan Vets of America, wrote on Twitter: &quot;As an Iraq vet, and as an American, I am beyond outraged by Shaima's death. This could have been so many of my friends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amen noted that the family of the woman had helped the U.S. Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How much more American can you get than to serve the country with pride and honor,&quot; Amen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shaima Al-Awadi's murder, like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's, was a senseless murder based upon racial animus,&quot; said Dawud Walid, an African-American Muslim leader from Detroit who is executive director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. &quot;We must come together as a society to have frank discussions about the toxic rhetorical environment which we currently live in that leads to such wanton violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The daughter of the mother told the TV station in San Diego:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's such an innocent woman. Why? Why did you do that?...We're not the terrorist. You are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community in the San Diego area will have three days of services for her at the Imam Ali Foundation Center, said Al-Zayadi.</SPAN></P>
