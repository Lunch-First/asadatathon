<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENGLEWOOD -- A march is being organized Sunday in Bergen County to  bring awareness to the shooting death of a 17-year old unarmed  black teenager in Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The NAACP of Bergen County and Mount Calvary Baptist Church are  planning the demonstration, which will begin after Sunday service  at 1 p.m. Participants will gather at the church and walk to Mackay  Park.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;From my viewpoint if it happened in Florida, it could very well  happen in New Jersey,&quot; said Anthony Cureton, the NAACP chapter  president.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Trayvon Martin was fatally shot on Feb. 26 while he was walking  from a convenience store to his father's home in the Florida city  of Sanford. George Zimmerman, 28, told investigators he shot Martin  in self-defense after the teen attacked him.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Zimmerman has not been arrested or charged.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Prior to the shooting, Zimmerman told police dispatchers Martin  looked suspicious. One dispatcher told Zimmerman not to pursue  Martin, according to news reports. At some point, the two got into  a fight and Zimmerman pulled out his gun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Zimmerman told police Martin attacked him after he had given up on  chasing the teenager and was returning to his sport utility  vehicle.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The shooting has ignited resentment toward the police department in  Florida. The police chief has temporarily stepped down, and the  prosecutor has quit the case. Civil rights groups have held rallies  in Florida and New York, saying the shooting was unjustified.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Cureton said stereotypes led to the killing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;Here's a young man walking in a hoodie, and he was perceived to be  one thing, when he wasn't,&quot; Cureton said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Justice Department and FBI have opened a civil rights  investigations on the case, and the prosecutor convened a grand  jury to determine whether to charge Zimmerman.  </SPAN></P>
