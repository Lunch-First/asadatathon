<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 26--STOCKTON -- What do you see when you see a black man walking down the street in a hoodie?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A proud Stockton entrepreneur  and married father of four? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or a suspicious figure on the prowl looking for someone to take advantage of?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ansar Muhammad hopes to attack misconceptions on either side of the hoodie when he helps unite anti-violence advocates for the thousand hoodie march on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're doing this to join the national outcry for justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and to draw attention to the violence that's taking place in Stockton,&quot; Muhammad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That escalating local violence was punctuated last week by fatal shootings in which a suspect fired at an officer with a gun used in a homicide a few days earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It makes me feel for my children and makes me question the decision i made to come here,&quot; said Muhammad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marches calling for the prosecution of George Zimmerman, the shooter of unarmed Florida teen Trayvon , are tied to local violence in Muhammad's  mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says there's an absence of accountability at the center of the shooting incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police did not initially charge Zimmerman for Martin's shooting because he claimed self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the February shooting, Zimmerman's own rambling 911call and his pursuit of the hoodie-clad Martin, who was only armed with iced tea and skittles, have heightened calls for his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 911 calls and witness accounts seem to suggest that Martin may have physically attacked the neighborhood watch captain who was following him, but many discount those details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adrian McCoy of Stockton is among those who believe Zimmerman was solely in the wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just feel that something there needs to happen,&quot; said McCoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad believes what will happen on the streets of Stockton and Sacramento will start a new chapter in hope and responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This city has been on every negative list...miserable city...murder city.  We want to show that good people have concern for the well- being of Stockton, &quot;he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The marches will start at 4pm on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stockton's march steps off from Waterfront Plaza across from the movie theater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sacramento's will begin in William Land Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates in the cities of Tracy and Modesto are also in the process of organizing joint marches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of Seattle will also host a similar event at the same time.</SPAN></P>
