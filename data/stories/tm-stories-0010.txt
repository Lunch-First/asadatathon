Thousands of Americans have rallied in cities across the country to protest the shooting death last month of an unarmed Florida teenager, in a case that has struck a nerve in a country still plagued by racial divisions. 
Dressed in black "hoodie" sweatshirts like the one TrayvonMartin was wearing when he was shot, and chanting "no justice, no peace," protesters in cities including Washington DC, Chicago, Tampa and Nashville on Saturday demanded justice in a case that many feel demonstrates lingering racism in American law and society.
In Washington DC, as many as 2000 people came to the steps of the mayor's office for a rally hastily organised over Twitter and Facebook.
The teenager at the heart of the protests was TrayvonMartin, 17, an African-American who was killed February 26 in Sanford, a suburb of Orlando.
His apparent killer, George Zimmerman, 28, is white and reportedly of Latino descent. He was a neighbourhood security patrol volunteer who was carrying a legal weapon. He reportedly used a racial epithet in a recorded call to police.
Sanford police said an initial investigation did not find enough evidence to arrest Zimmerman, who claimed to have acted in self-defence. A grand jury will decide April 10 whether to charge Zimmerman with murder.
Saturday's rallies continued several days of protests that started with a "million-hoodie march" in New York and Miami March 21.
