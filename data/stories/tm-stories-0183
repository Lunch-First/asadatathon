<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT OBAMA, addressing the killing of an unarmed Florida teen in deeply personal terms, said he saw the faces of his children inside the hoodie of the slain black youth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's first African-American President spoke about the racially charged slaying for the first time Friday at the White House, expressing his heartfelt sympathy for the parents of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said in response to a reporter's question. &quot;And when I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boy's parents &quot;are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves,&quot; the President said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was gunned down Feb. 26 in a suburb of Orlando, Fla., while walking back to his father's house carrying nothing more lethal than an iced tea and a bag of Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 140-pound teen was killed by George Zimmerman, a self-appointed neighborhood watchman who claimed that he only fired in self-defense after the 17-year-old jumped him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 28, said he became suspicious of Martin because the young man was wearing a hooded sweatshirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of the high school student caused a nationwide uproar that intensified when the shooter was released without any criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents issued a statement Friday thanking the President for his support in their time of suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's words &quot;touched us deeply and made us wonder: If his son looked like Trayvon and wore a hoodie, would he be suspicious too?&quot; asked Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign of support for Trayvon, Knicks center Amar'e Stoudemire wore a hoodie for a portion of pregame warmups Friday, and NBA superstar LeBron James tweeted a photo of the Miami Heat all wearing hoodies with the hashtag #WeAreTrayvonMartin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesman Jay Carney said it was unclear if the President planned to contact the parents directly about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have any information in that regard,&quot; he told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, carefully choosing his words to avoid any interference with the investigation, expressed his support for a Justice Department and FBI civil rights probe of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida grand jury is also considering charges against Zimmerman in the slaying that forced the local police chief to temporarily step down and the local prosecutor to recuse himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think all of us have to do some soul-searching to figure out how does something like this happen,&quot; the commander in chief said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And that means we examine the laws, the context for what happened, as well as the specifics of the incident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President's GOP challengers echoed his call, with Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich all bemoaning the tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a point in there where there ought to be some kind of signal that it's pretty clear that this is a guy who found a hobby that's very dangerous,&quot; Gingrich said referring to Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
