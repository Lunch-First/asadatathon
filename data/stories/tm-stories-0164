<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in Florida last week has sparked a national debate over &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in many states, fights over the controversial legislation have been going on for years without garnering much attention from anyone other than prosecutors and gun-rights activists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although George Zimmerman admits to shooting Martin, he says he acted in self-defense and has not been arrested. Under a 2005 Florida law, a citizen who uses deadly force is immune from prosecution when &quot;he or she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backed by the National Rifle Association, first in Florida and then across the country, state legislators have pushed for expanding the right to use deadly force. Twenty-one states have laws giving citizens wide latitude to use deadly force without first attempting to retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are some states where &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; was recently passed or is up for debate:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l A bill passed by the legislature in Minnesota was just vetoed by Gov. Mark Dayton (D).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l In Pennsylvania, former governor Ed Rendell (D) vetoed a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; bill; it was signed last year by Gov. Tom Corbett (R).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l Democratic lawmakers staged a walkout in Iowa recently to avoid a vote on the legislation. It will probably be blocked on procedural grounds this year, but state Rep. Matt Windschitl (R) plans to reintroduce it next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I anticipate that there are some people who are going to try use this unfortunate incident as an excuse not to expand Iowans' right to self-defense,&quot; Windschitl said, but argued that this case should be balanced against the lives saved by laws like the one in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l In New Hampshire last fall, Republicans in the state legislature overrode a veto from Gov. John Lynch (D) in order to pass a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think if we end up with more moderate Republicans and certainly more Democrats&quot; after the 2012 elections, &quot;it could be on the table again,&quot; said state Rep. Christopher Serlin (D).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l In Alaska, legislation has passed the House and is being considered by the state Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not every &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, however, came from a Republican-controlled state government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oklahoma's Democratic governor signed one in 2006, as part of the first wave of &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; success. So did Homeland Security Chief Janet Napolitano, when she was the Democratic governor of Arizona. In Alabama, a bill identical to Florida's was first introduced by a Democrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, however, there is a partisan divide - particularly in the past two years as advocates have attempted to bring the legislation to less-conservative states - with Republicans supporting the bills and Democrats opposing them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In states where the policy has yet to become law, supporters will likely find new resistance. In states where it has recently become law, its supporters could face a backlash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; argue that it doesn't apply in this case and does not protect killers who did not act in true self-defense. (Republican presidential candidates Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have also suggested that the law does not apply.) Opponents say the law encourages vigilante justice by creating ambiguity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've never thought by itself that the law is the main issue,&quot; said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. &quot;What we think is the main issue is the mentality that that law provides.&quot; </SPAN></P>
