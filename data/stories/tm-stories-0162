<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the rain trickled down on Freedom Plaza on Saturday afternoon, young men pulled their hoodies up to cover their heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; the young men chanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They gathered in memory of Martin, whose death at the hands of a neighborhood watch volunteer has stirred the passions of the nation, launched federal and state investigations, and fueled calls for justice in rallies across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were young men like Darryl Jackson, 15, of Largo, who said after the event that he came with his mother, Elisa, because &quot;it could have been me.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, a black Florida teenager, was fatally shot last month as he walked back from a convenience store toward a home in a gated community while wearing a hoodie to cover his head from the rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're standing up today because we are all Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; said the Rev. Graylan Hagler of Plymouth Congregational Church of Christ in the District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, whose father is white and mother is Hispanic, said he killed the 17-year-old in self-defense. He has not been arrested. Martin, who was unarmed, was carrying a bag of Skittles and a can of iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to get to the bottom of this,&quot; comedian and activist Dick Gregory told the crowd of nearly 1,500 people at Freedom Plaza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoodie-clad protesters carried placards with Martin's image and signs that read: &quot;No Justice, No Peace&quot; and &quot;Justice For Trayvon.&quot; Others held bags of Skittles above their heads, chanting &quot;Skittles and tea are not suspicious to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar rallies have taken place in major cities across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday night, thousands participated in the Million Hoodie March in Philadelphia, and thousands rallied on Wednesday night in Sanford, Fla., the town where Martin was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many demonstrators Saturday wore black and hoodies, clothes similar to what Martin wore the day he was killed. Zimmerman, 28, followed Martin through the gated community and told a 911 operator that the teenager looked suspicious. The 911 operator directed Zimmerman not to pursue the teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elisa Jackson said she was compelled to participate in Saturday's event. &quot;I don't want to wait until it happens to my son, because Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is my son,&quot; she said. &quot;I had to take a stand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio host Joe Madison said Martin's shooting &quot;is nothing but a 21st-century Emmett Till.&quot; He called for a national hoodie day April 10, when the grand jury is scheduled to meet in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some speakers used the rally as an opportunity to encourage the protesters to be more active in their communities and less apathetic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't just about today,&quot; said the Rev. Tony Lee, pastor of Community of Hope African Methodist Episcopal Church in Temple Hills. &quot;If this stops today, it doesn't mean anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another community activist said he wanted to see the &quot;same indignation&quot; over black-on-black crime, a suggestion that resulted in huge applause from the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers of the rally said they hoped it offered support to the Martin family and prods Florida authorities to prosecute Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want Zimmerman prosecuted [and for the case to be] handled in a thorough and impartial manner,&quot; said Heather Raspberry of the District, who helped organize the event using Facebook and Twitter. &quot;We just want justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the speakers echoed the words of President Obama, who weighed in on the incident Friday, speaking about it from a personal standpoint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said from the Rose Garden. &quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama did not address local law enforcement's efforts or call for Zimmerman's arrest. Instead, he directed his comments to Martin's parents, saying they &quot;are right to expect that all of us, as Americans, are going to treat this with the seriousness it deserves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millions of people have taken to social media in support of Martin, posting pictures of themselves wearing hoodies and asking &quot;Do I look suspicious?&quot; and adding pictures of Martin on Facebook and Twitter pages.</SPAN></P>
