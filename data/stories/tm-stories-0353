<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">College students are among those attempting to bring an arrest in the fatal shooting of an unarmed teen in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, many were posting photos of themselves in hooded sweatshirts, as Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was wearing when he was shot and killed during a confrontation with a neighborhood watch captain on Feb. 26. And tonight, they are expected to join hundreds at a rally featuring the Rev. Al Sharpton at a Sanford church. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 15 students from Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach have signed up for the rally that starts at 7 p.m. outside First Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church, 700 S. Elm Ave., Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And many more B-CU students are expected to attend a March 31 NAACP protest in Sanford, said Ebony Minter, the school's student- government president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the justice rallies throughout history have been led by college students. This is not anything new,&quot; Minter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students getting involved also have a role model with a statue in her honor on the Daytona Beach campus bearing her name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our founder, Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, was a champion of civil rights . . . (for) standing up for those who were disenfranchised and not being treated in a manner that is right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could be Trayvon&nbsp;Martin tomorrow in Daytona Beach,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even students who aren't planning on attending the rallies are posting messages of support on Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christine Jacobson, a senior at Stetson University in DeLand, said students are signing petitions calling for changes to Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which legal experts say has made difficult the arrest of the shooter, George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I definitely would stand in solidarity with those who are calling for the arrest of George Zimmerman,&quot; Jacobson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. L. Ronald Durham, pastor of Greater Friendship Missionary Baptist Church in Daytona Beach, is part of the team organizing tonight's rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the event is expecting numbers too great to fit inside the Sanford church so arrangements are being made to have the gathering outdoors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are trying to minimize any potential problems,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't want people who are angry over the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin shooting to become even angrier because they can't see what is going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
