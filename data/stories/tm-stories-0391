<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a town hall meeting on Tuesday evening in Florida, where 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot last month, the American Civil Liberties Union urged residents to remain calm but demanded the arrest of shooter George Zimmerman. Mr Zimmerman has not been charged in the February 26 shooting and has said he shot Mr Martin, who was returning to a gated community after buying sweets, in self-defence. The US Justice Department's civil rights division has opened a probe into the shooting. But authorities may be hamstrung by a state Stand Your Ground law that allows people to defend themselves with deadly force and does not require retreat in the face of danger. </SPAN></P>
