PRESIDENT Barack Obama has ordered an investigation into the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager - saying the victim could have been his own son. 
Trayvon Martin, 17, was gunned down by white neighbourhood watch co-ordinator George Zimmerman last month - sparking outrage in the black community.
Trayvon was carrying sweets and a soft drink in the street when he was shot in Orlando, Florida.
President Obama - dad to two girls - said: "All of us have to do some soul-searching to figure out how does something like this happen.
"My message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin - if I had a son he'd look like Trayvon."
Zimmerman, 28, says he acted in self-defence.
He has not been arrested or charged.
Florida laws allow a person to use deadly force if threatened.
