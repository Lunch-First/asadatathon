<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager in Florida this week has triggered an anguished national dialogue, one that reached Pittsfield yesterday in the form of a rally at Park Square. The shooting raises uncomfortable questions about racism and justice in America, as well as the dangerous folly of permissive gun laws that invite needless tragedy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin, 17, was returning to a gated community in Sanford, Florida after a trip to a candy story when he was gunned down by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain who claimed that he was acting in self-defense. Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; gun law, like similar laws in 20 other states, enables gun owners to shoot first because they think they are threatened, which is basically a license to kill indiscriminately. Mr. Zimmerman has not been charged with a crime, which is, as Ty Allan Jackson, the organizer of the Park Square rally said in The Eagle, a &quot;slap in the face for people of color.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama said Friday the nation has &quot;some soul-searching&quot; to do and it begins with the racial stereotyping and paranoia that poison America. Americans must also ask why, in a nation where horrific gun violence is a routine event, the states and Washington continue to re spond with increasingly lenient gun laws that make it easy for fools and murderers to get weapons and use them on innocents. America must take back its streets from the killers and their misguided legislative enablers.</SPAN></P>
