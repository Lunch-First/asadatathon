<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For more than a decade, George Zimmerman dreamed of a life in law enforcement - but instead of becoming a real cop, he lived out his big blue fantasy by tracking down stray dogs, &quot;suspicious&quot; children and other intruders in his gated Florida community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before he gunned down unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin - an incident President Obama confronted Friday, calling it a tragedy - Zimmerman had been a nuisance to 911 operators. He would carry around with him a pistol and the hope that he would one day wear a badge.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman grew up in Manassas, Va., a Catholic altar boy who was the son of a military man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He wrote in his senior yearbook that he was &quot;going to Florida to work with my godfather who just bought a $1 million business&quot; - but Zimmerman's heart was pulling him toward law enforcement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He wanted to join the police force - either the State Police or the county police,&quot; said George Hall, 78, a retired minister and longtime neighbor of Zimmerman in Virginia.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He asked me to write him a letter of recommendation, and I was glad to. He was such a wonderful kid. I thought he'd be the kind of officer I wanted protecting me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I had no doubt about his abilities to look out for citizens. I would have an easier time respecting him than I have with some officers now.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hall said he didn't know when Zimmerman's detective dreams were dashed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But that didn't stop Zimmerman from playing the part.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He had a license to carry a concealed weapon, and he started a neighborhood watch last September in his gated community in Sanford, Fla.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Well before that, he was calling cops for just the slightest, racially tinged suspicions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the watch volunteer at the 260-unit Retreat at Twin Lakes, he became a paranoid pest - peppering 911 with at least 46 calls. They varied in urgency, but in the last year focused mostly on black men or boys. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That included a &quot;suspicious&quot; &shy;7- to 9-year-old boy with a &quot;skinny build&quot; and short black hair. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   In November 2006, he called to report a red Toyota pickup truck &quot;driving real slow&quot; around the neighborhood for five minutes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In September 2009, he called about a &quot;yellow speed bike&quot; weaving in and out of traffic and doing &quot;wheelies.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A month later, Zimmerman was hot on the scent of an &quot;aggressive white and brown pit bull.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And last August, he reported a black man he believed was &shy;&quot;involved in recent&quot; burglaries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The son of a white father and a Peruvian mother, Zimmerman was ambitious, friends said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman moved to Florida in 2001, and he enrolled in Seminole State College in 2003, pursuing a vocational certificate to become an insurance agent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Down South, he had his own brushes with the law. In 2005, he was arrested for assaulting a cop and resisting arrest. He avoided conviction by entering a pretrial-diversion program.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That same year, his ex-fianc&eacute;e, Veronica Zuazo, filed a restraining order against him, claiming he had been near her home &quot;just checking up&quot; on her. When she demanded that he leave, he allegedly grew violent, pushing her, according to the Miami Herald.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The next day, he filed his own petition and claimed she wanted him to stay the night and grew &shy;violent when he refused. A judge ordered both to stay away from each other.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2008, he explained away his arrest on an enrollment application to a citizen's law-enforcement academy program at the Seminole County Sheriff's Office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I was in an altercation with an undercover officer that was taking part in an ATF sting for &shy;underage drinking in UCF [University of Central Florida],&quot; Zimmerman wrote, according to documents obtained by The Post.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He never told me he was an &shy;officer and assaulted me first. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;My father is a retired magistrate judge for the Supreme Court of Virginia and my mother was a deputy clerk of court for over 20 years,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I hold law-enforcement officers in the highest regard as I hope one day to become one.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman was accepted into the 14-week course, which offers civilians an inside look at the sheriff's office, the courthouse and the jail. He never became a cop - he was a pencil pusher, according to the Orlando Sentinel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman re-enrolled at Seminole State in 2009 - still with the hopes of joining law enforcement - but was booted last week because of safety concerns for him, the Los Angeles Times said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman's paranoia led directly to his Feb. 26 encounter with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police said Zimmerman first spied Trayvon walking from a 7-Eleven at about 7:15 p.m. and called police to report him as suspicious. Although he was told by a 911 operator not to get involved, Zimmerman followed Trayvon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They scuffled and Zimmerman shot him once in the chest with his licensed Kel-Tec 9mm semiautomatic handgun. Zimmerman says he acted in self-defense. A special prosecutor, the FBI and the US Department of Justice are investigating. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman is also facing trouble from the militant New Black Panther Party, which yesterday offered a $10,000 reward for his &quot;capture,&quot; the Sentinel reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  George Zimmerman has placed at least 46 calls to 911 in the last eight years. In the last year, his calls focused on blacks in his gated community: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  April 22, 2011: Reports &quot;black male, 7 to 9 years old with skinny build,&quot; walking around the neighborhood. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Aug. 3, 2011: Calls in a black male he &quot;believes is involved in recent burglaries in the neighborhood.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Aug. 6, 2011: Fingers two black teens he thinks &quot;have been burglarizing homes in this area.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Oct. 1, 2011: Reports two black males, approximately 20 to 30 years old, whom he does not recognize. He says he's &quot;concerned due to recent burglaries in the area.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Feb. 2, 2012: Drops dime on a black male because it is &quot;unknown what he is doing.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Feb. 26: Calls about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;Hey, we've had some break-ins in my neighborhood, and there is a real suspicious guy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked by the dispatcher what the suspect looks like, he says:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He looks black . . . Now he's coming towards me. He's got his hand in his waistband. </SPAN></P>
