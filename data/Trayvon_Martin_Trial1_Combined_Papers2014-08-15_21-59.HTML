<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Holder repeated his promise that Martin's death would be fully investigated by Department of Justice. NEW YORK Eric Holder, the US attorney general,&nbsp;repeated Tuesday his promise that 17 year old&nbsp;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;tragic and unnecessary&quot; killing by&nbsp;George&nbsp;Zimmerman, who was not found guilty of the murder&nbsp;by a Florida court,&nbsp;would be fully investigated by the Department of Justice. Speaking at the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People&nbsp;(NAACP), Holder said&nbsp;The Department of Justice would&nbsp;consider all available information before determining what action to take.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But independent of the legal determination, I believe this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly and openly about the complicated and emotionally-charged issues that this case has raised,&quot; he said. He said&nbsp;&nbsp;the protests after Zimmerman's acquittal,&nbsp;were 'largely' peaceful apart from a small number of arrests in California. &quot;In the days leading up to the weekend's verdict, some predicted and prepared for riots and waves of civil unrest across the country. Some feared that the anger of those who disagreed with the jury might overshadow and obscure the issues,&quot; he said.&nbsp;&quot;Those who act in a contrary manner do not honor the memory of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;&nbsp; Referring to his childhood, as&nbsp;the country's first African-American attorney general, Holder told of&nbsp;the progress that still needed to be made in race relations in the US. &quot;Years ago, some of these same issues drove my father to sit down with me, to have a conversation about how, as a young black man, I should interact with the police, what to say and how to conduct myself, if I was ever stopped or confronted in a way I thought was unwarranted,&quot; he said adding he had to have&nbsp;a similar conversation with&nbsp;his own 15-year-old son, &quot;not to burden him with the baggage of eras long gone, but to make him aware of the world he must still confront.&quot; Holder also criticized the US's&nbsp;'stand-your-ground law' that eliminated &quot;the commonsense and age-old requirement&quot; that people who felt threatened had a duty to retreat. &quot;These laws try to fix something that was never broken,&quot; he said. &quot;We must stand our ground to ensure that our laws reduce violence and take a hard look at laws that contribute to more violence than they prevent. By allowing and perhaps encouraging violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety. The list of resulting tragedies is long and unfortunately has victimized too many who are innocent.&quot; englishnews@aa.com.tr</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 17--Walking in line to the words of Sam Cooke's song &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come,&quot; about 200 people remembered Trayvon&nbsp;Martin at Zinn Park Tuesday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the second Trayvon Walk Out Event Anniston has seen this week, with the other occurring Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some wore hoodies. Others wore shirts with Trayvon's name in glitter sequins across their chests. A little girl held up a white sign with the words, &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When event organizer Kumira Mason asked members of the crowd to add their names to a petition asking the U.S. Department of Justice to open a civil rights case against George Zimmerman for killing Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, one man hollered out, &quot;Where can I sign?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wanted to do something for young people in our community so they don't end up in the same predicament,&quot; Mason said when asked about the inspiration behind the event. &quot;It always brings back memories of Heath.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas &quot;DJ Jay-Wheezy&quot; Heath has been using a wheelchair to get around for more than nine years. Heath was shot five times and is paralyzed from the chest down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heath said he later discovered the shooter was a white supremacist who was racially profiling him, so what happened to Trayvon hits close to home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;November will be 10 years since I was shot sitting in the car at the gas station,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heath provided music Tuesday and during a Walk Out event at the park on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had such a good turnout we wanted to do another,&quot; Mason said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pastor Eugene Leonard, 33, said he really wished the verdict in the trial had been different. He said the people in attendance weren't just marching for Trayvon -- they were marching for victims of violent crime everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hopefully it will bring peace to the parents of Trayvon,&quot; Leonard said. &quot;We're praying for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dave Baker, the president of the Anniston-Calhoun County NAACP, said he was happy to see the turnout at the event because the bullet that ended Trayvon's life is the same type of bullet that ends other people's lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only way we can stop this senseless killing is to turn to each other instead of against one another,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shajuan Davis, 31, of Oxford agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope that by us coming out here that his family will know they have support here and everywhere,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evening began with a prayer for Trayvon, Trayvon's parents and for George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterward came an explanation of the Stand Your Ground law by attorney, Darenda Miller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stand Your Ground is basically a defense for justifiable homicide,&quot; Miller said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the event officially began at 6 p.m., participants didn't begin their walk until 7:09 p.m., the exact time Trayvon had been walking home, Mason said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will walk peacefully, like Trayvon had been walking,&quot; Mason said prior to the walk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters were encouraged to bring hoodies, bags of Skittles and Arizona iced tea with them -- the items Trayvon had at the time he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of Trayvon walked around the park one time before joining together to form the shape of Trayvon's initials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the event was a success, Leonard said he was sad to see that there were no white faces in the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to do another one to embrace our community. This is a time when we need to bring out unity between both races and bring us all together in our march,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guwahati, July 17 -- Time after time happenings in the United States of America testify to the reality that it is not a land of equality, never mind that an African-American is the President of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cradle of white-supremacy organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan, there is gross discrimination in favour of Caucasoid people over those with skins which are somewhat less white in colour. A large section of the poorer segment of society constitute of Blacks and Hispanics; they also are deemed worthy to take on the lesser jobs, which explains why in airports and other public places, it is the non-whites who appear to be engaged in low-paying, menial tasks. It is equally true that a larger percentage of anti-social elements come from Black and Hispanic neighbourhoods ' it does not require much sociological acumen to comprehend why this should be so. This factor leads to racial profiling ' the stigma associated with a segment of a particular community stains the entire social group ' thereby making the job of individuals to overcome the handicap of birth all the more difficult. The latest example of such racial profiling has been the case involving George Zimmerman, a volunteer of a neighbourhood watch in Florida, who shot dead an unarmed black teenager ' and his acquittal on the charge of murder by a Jury which consisted of six women, five of these being white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been some violent repercussions to this verdict, but not to the extent when thousands of protesters had marched after the incident first occurred a year ago. The acquittal of Zimmerman of the charge of shooting Trayvon&nbsp;Martin citing self-defence throws up other questions on liberal interpretation of 'self-defence' in many of the US states including Florida, as also the liberal gun-laws which have seen a recurrent pattern of mayhem. But, above all, it deals with the issue of continuance of racial profiling whereby most American whites consider every black teenager, no matter how well educated or coming from what background, to be a potential criminal. This is an ugly reality in the American society ' one which cost Trayvon his life, his only crime being that he was at the wrong place at the wrong time when a trigger-happy vigilante too was present. However, it would be wrong to place the onus of culpability on the American society alone ' the white-black-brown stereotyping is prevalent in most European countries, while the racial profiling in some form or the other is to be found all over the world. It is the racist bigotry which leads to negative profiling, and it would need a long time for the world to see an end to it. In the meantime, victims such as Trayvon would continue to pay with their lives because human beings cannot perceive the basic commonalities of the existential condition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verdict is distressing,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">backs vigilante action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most distressing aspect of the case which vindicated George Zimmerman's killing of Trayvon Martin was not the racial/ethnic one. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most troubling message sent by this verdict is that vigilantism is acceptable and justifiable in just about any situation. The fact that the person who was vindicated was armed, while the person killed was unarmed, was evidently not important. The fact that the killer --- for that is what he ultimately was --- ignored instructions from law enforcement to not pursue the victim but chose to escalate the situation, which resulted in a fatal shooting, was not relevant, either. Evidently, the only thing that was relevant was that Zimmerman thought Martin had no business being there --- so Zimmerman was entitled to confront him and make him leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict has communicated to anyone inclined to take matters into their own hands that it is OK to do so. Some will interpret this as an &quot;open season.&quot; Heaven help us. FRANK S. LOULAN, JONESBORO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEALTH CARE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caregivers reacted to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government meddling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Hospitals buy out, cash in&quot; (News, July 7 ), which reported on the partnership between Northside Hospital, Atlanta Cancer Care and Georgia Cancer Specialists, the focus was on the rise in costs to patients and the need for clinicians to adopt business practices to continue to deliver care. The article didn't include the reason why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is nothing wrong with health care in America, and there never has been. The problem is four decades of government regulation and federal manipulation of artificially contrived compensation formulas. But for government interference, Northside Hospital, Atlanta Cancer Care and Georgia Cancer Specialists would all be capable of delivering top-quality care independently and at a cost that would be sensible and affordable. Sometimes, understanding the &quot;why&quot; of a story is the most interesting aspect. DENNIS MCGOWAN, SNELLVILLE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NUDE DANCING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Survey would show</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">if activity is harmful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;'And the Atlanta clubs went nude the next day'&quot; (Metro, July 7), the U.S. Supreme Court regards nude dancing as near the outer limits of free speech, and as such, would likely restrict or even ban it if enough evil effects could be proven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, I'd love to see the results of a survey showing how many (and what percentage) of nude dancers have been led into drug use and prostitution via this activity because of the likely need to dull the senses, and the ensuing result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clubs will say that neither is permitted and that many or most dancers escape these pitfalls --- but a simple survey would provide the truth so that action, if appropriate, could be taken. ROBERT J. THOMAS SR., LILBURN</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---Andy Sims, Douglasville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: The 2-inch-thick steel cable that Wallenda used to walk across the 1,400-foot gap weighs 2 1/2 pounds a foot and was too heavy to be flown across the gorge by a helicopter. A crew from O'Connell Electric, in Victor, N.Y., flew a synthetic rope from one side of the Little Colorado River Gorge to the other. They attached the cable to the rope, and using a pulley system, pulled the steel cable across the gorge, which is near the Grand Canyon. The cable anchors were buried 150 feet in the ground. A metal basket was used to carry crew members across the wire so they could attach weights every 60 feet. Those weights helped steady the wire from winds during Wallenda's 22-minute walk on June 23. The same O'Connell Electric crew also installed the cable for Wallenda's walk across Niagara Falls in 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: In Florida, Casey Anthony's trial had 12 jurors and George Zimmerman's trial had six jurors. Why the difference?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---Larry Milam, McDonough</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: There are six jurors in felony cases and 12 jurors for death-penalty cases in Florida, the Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel reported. Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Casey Anthony was on trial for first-degree murder two years ago, a death-penalty case regarding the death of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee Anthony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The not-guilty verdict in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case was understandable given Florida law and in light of continued reasonable doubt about what happened on the tragic night of Feb. 26, 2012. In the end, evidence presented in the 19-day trial could not eliminate that doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That same doubt ought to preclude federal charges against Zimmerman. Let the jury's verdict decide the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, the verdict does not alter the fact that Trayvon ought to be alive today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He died because of three bad choices made by George Zimmerman: First, the neighborhood watch volunteer tucked a pistol in his pants earlier that evening; when he saw a young black male, he thought &quot;criminal;&quot; and he then acted out of false courage that the pistol provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those mistakes weren't enough to justify a guilty verdict --- standards of proof are and must be higher in a court of criminal law. But they were mistakes that produced tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not surprisingly, the verdict has inspired anger and deep sorrow among millions of Americans, particularly within the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That anger has for the most part been expressed peacefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others have celebrated the verdict, with some making the odd claim that the only reason Zimmerman had been prosecuted in the first place was because of Martin's race, as if young black males are some sort of protected class in the American legal system. Over the weekend Texas Gov. Rick Perry made a related claim, asserting that the verdict proved that &quot;our justice system is color-blind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Perry to Al Sharpton, it has been tempting for people on both sides to burden the Martin case with cultural weight that in truth it should never have been asked to bear, particularly in a court of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury's verdict was based on details and facts specific to this one tragic circumstance; it was not a verdict based on some overarching concept of racial justice or injustice. George Zimmerman, not American culture, was on trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Perry's claim about a color-blind justice system should not go unchallenged, because it simply is not true and because it gets to the core of what made this case so emotional for many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, overwhelming evidence contradicting Perry's claim can be found in his own state of Texas, where among other things, black murder defendants are considerably more likely to be sentenced to death than are white defendants for the same crime. (The same can be said of Georgia.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the example of Harris County, which comprises the Houston area and by itself has sent more people to execution than any state but Texas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 2011 investigation by the Houston Chronicle found that from 2005-2011, 50 percent of those arrested for murder in Harris County were black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, of the 13 people facing the death penalty in Harris County courtrooms in that time frame, 12 had been black and one had been Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You have to go back to 2004, to the case of a serial murderer who actively sought capital punishment, to find a white person charged with capital murder in that county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Chronicle also noted, &quot;Eight of 12 African-Americans were sentenced to death during the tenure of Chuck Rosenthal, who resigned as district attorney in 2008 over sexually charged and racially tinged emails. One included a photo of a black man, lying on the ground surrounded by watermelon and a bucket of chicken, that was labeled 'fatal overdose.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As many have pointed out, the greatest threat to the life of a young black male is another young black male, not government and not neighborhood-watch captains with a John Wayne complex. That is a tragic problem, but it is a problem that is being addressed with some success. According to FBI statistics, the murder rate for black offenders was cut by more than half between 1991 and 2008. It's still far too high, but let's at least acknowledge that progress is being made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, let's also acknowledge that unequal treatment under the law is a separate and distinct issue from violence that is perpetrated on the personal level. Both are real problems; both should be acknowledged and addressed. But higher incidence of crime among black Americans does not justify discrimination in the enforcement of laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was not a walking crime statistic; he was a 17-year-old kid headed home in the rain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ignorance in this country is almost laughable if it were not so damaging. The following are just three examples of what I have seen lately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the recent &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict in the case of George Zimmerman. The ignorance that I see here is the fact that the verdict of &quot;guilty&quot; was sealed when Zimmerman decided to get out of his car and follow Trayvon Martin. How can it not be an example of ignorance when the 911 dispatcher plainly told Zimmerman not to follow Martin! This was not a case of self-defense, but a case of ignorance and/or a case of racial profiling! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the ignorance that surrounds the bill that would allow illegal immigrants to get on the fast track toward getting legal American citizenship. All one has to do is open the mind and the eyes to see that almost all of the undesirable jobs that are absolutely necessary are done by illegals! Why shouldn't these hard -working people - human beings - be allowed to get American citizenship as soon as possible?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, more closer to home, is this boondoggle in North Augusta called Project Jackson. The ignorance in this is that the Aiken County government and the Aiken County school board will not demand that a countywide referendum be mandatory to go forward before county and school taxes are put in harm's way! If the county and school board vote to back this boondoggle, then the citizens of Aiken County will be ignorant if we don't demand that a third-party audit be performed to see where every penny of our tax dollars is going!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am quite sure many other examples can be thought of. As I stated before, ignorance can be laughable when it is not injurious to others. But these examples are injurious to others! Perhaps these examples can be reversed for the good of other citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Cal Thomas; Pg. A4</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">578 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are so programmed by our history with race in America that reaction to the acquittal of George Zimmerman on charges of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin depends largely upon one's individual, even group experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are African-American, you might react like former Washington, D.C., homicide detective Rod Wheeler. Appearing on Fox News, Wheeler said many blacks look at quarterback Michael Vick, jailed for taking part in an illegal interstate dog-fighting ring, and wonder why Zimmerman gets away with killing a young black man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are white, or Hispanic, you could possibly see the trial as something whipped up by the always racially conscious media and rhetorical bomb-throwers like Rev. Al Sharpton. You might conclude that if the victim had been white and the perpetrator black the media would have shown little or no interest. Or you could point to O.J. Simpson, who was acquitted of killing two white people by a majority African-American jury. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YOUR VIEW would be reinforced by a case in Georgia in which four African-American teenagers beat a 36-year-old white man as he emerged from a gas station convenience store. While trying to escape, the man stumbled into the middle lane of a highway where he was struck by a car and killed. The Marietta (Ga.) Daily Journal reported that the four are charged with felony murder, aggravated assault and violation of the Georgia Street Gang Act. The incident occurred two weeks ago, but I have seen no national media coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As defense lawyers noted after the Zimmerman verdict, the loss of any life, especially a young one like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, is a tragedy, but tragedy and race were not on trial in Sanford, Fla. Putting all extraneous considerations aside, the jury of six women was asked if there was sufficient evidence presented by the prosecution to convict George Zimmerman of murder or manslaughter. The jury found there was not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department says it will look into the shooting death of Martin to determine if evidence in the case &quot;reveals a prosecutable violation.&quot; That may turn out to be more of a political decision than one based on facts. It would likely perpetuate the media narrative of blacks as victims and whites (one CNN reporter ludicrously called Zimmerman a &quot;white Hispanic&quot;) as descendants of slave masters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT HELPS keep us divided is our propensity for labeling and categorizing people. Certain behaviors and language are tolerated, while others are not. Some people can get away with language that others cannot. Some faiths can be disparaged while others are insulated from criticism. We hyphenate some Americans, making them appear as though they are less than fully American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is needed is one standard. One national identity. One America. We're not there yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family, compared Trayvon's death to those of Emmett Till and Medgar Evers. Any attempt to turn Trayvon into a civil rights martyr similar to Till and Evers goes well beyond the apples and oranges analogy. More to the point was a comment by Zimmerman's attorney Don West: &quot;The prosecution of George Zimmerman was disgraceful.&quot; The defense believes he should never have been brought to trial. Co-defense counsel Mark O'Mara speculated about &quot;how many lawsuits will be spawned by this fiasco.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Probably quite a few, given our never-ending racial double standard. As both sides noted during and after the trial, there are no winners in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Georgia should keep its self-defense law, Gov. Nathan Deal told reporters Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of a major legislative committee said his panel might consider repealing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deal said he was pleased that no violent demonstrations had broken out in Georgia over the not-guilty verdict in the George Zim-mer-man case. Groups across the country have said the verdict and the Stand Your Ground Law encourage attacks on unarmed blacks like 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law allows people to defend themselves with deadly force if threatened in their home, business, car or place they are entitled to be. Georgia is one of 22 states with similar laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Zimmerman did not assert a defense under that law, it has become the focus of protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deal predicted some lawmaker would introduce legislation to repeal it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm fairly sure that there will be somebody in the General Assembly who will ask us to at least revisit ... the Stand Your Ground legislation that was passed in 2006,&quot; he said. &quot;I do not see anything out of the ordinary in terms of that statute in that it is very similar to the statute in other states, including ... Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Democratic Whip Vincent Fort, of Atlanta, in-troduced Senate Bill 147</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a week before Martin's shooting last year. The bill would require anyone with a gun to withdraw from a threat before using deadly force. Within days of Martin's death, Fort became a steady voice in calling for changing Stand Your Ground, but his bill stalled in the Senate Judiciary Non-Civil Committee led by Sen. Jesse Stone, R-Waynesboro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reached at his office, Stone said he might schedule a hearing on it in the next legislative session that starts in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(Fort) didn't have the votes to get it out of committee as far as I could tell,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a little premature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman said the committee has limited time to devote to bills that are unlikely to pass and that the leadership last year had no interest in passing any bills on gun owners' rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor predicted the public hearings and debate would be emotionally charged. But he doesn't expect to be swayed. &quot;I do not see any reason to change it, but there again, that is the will of the General Assembly that will prevail.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weapons rather than race caused Trayvon Martin's death</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVEN with a black president, anger over alleged racial injustice in US courts remains deeply ingrained. So uproar over the acquittal of the man who shot and killed the African-American Trayvon Martin is inevitable. But those protesting on the streets ill-serve their own case by seeing his tragic death as just the result of racial profiling rather than a consequence of America's failure to enforce effective gun control. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was fraught with racial politics from the start but heard no evidence that George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer who called police about the hooded teenager's movements, was racially motivated. He was, however, one of America's legions of licensed gun carriers. So an encounter that might otherwise have led to little more than angry words ended inevitably when Mr Zimmerman (perhaps fortified by Florida's ``Stand Your Ground'' law that justifies lethal force if attacked) shot Trayvon. The case, described by The New York Times as ``weak on evidence and long on outrage'', has been grossly politicised. When prosecutors found the evidence insufficient, Florida's Governor replaced them with others -- anything to get a conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now federal authorities may bring civil rights charges. The lesson of this tragedy is in the failure of gun-control laws and the proliferation of weapons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawmakers of both parties voice doubts about NSA surveillance programs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers of both parties expressed deep skepticism Wednesday about the government's bulk collection of Americans' telephone records and threatened not to renew the legislative authority that has been used to sanction a program described as &quot;off the tracks legally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">A congressional backlash appeared to be coalescing around the idea that the administration's interpretation of its powers far exceeds what lawmakers intended. At a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, lawmakers forcefully pressed officials from the National Security Agency, the Justice Department, the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to justify the government's collection and storage of the communications records of vast numbers of Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is unsustainable, it's outrageous and must be stopped immediately,&quot; said Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the highest-ranking Democrat on the panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who sponsored the Patriot Act that ostensibly authorized the collection, warned that the House might not renew Section 215 of the act, a key provision that gives the government its authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've got to change how you operate 215 . . . or you're not going to have it anymore,&quot; Sensenbrenner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sharp and sometimes angry questioning stood in sharp contrast to the tone of hearings on the surveillance programs by congressional intelligence committees in recent weeks. It also came as the government faces a growing number of legal challenges to its collection of &quot;metadata&quot; -- information about the numbers called by Americans, the date and time of the calls, and how long those calls lasted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman juror calls for change in self-defense laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A member of the jury that found George Zimmerman not guilty in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin called for changes to Florida's self-defense law, which she said gave jurors no option but to acquit the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror's statement adds to pleas from around the country to change the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws that many states adopted after Florida did so under former Governor Jeb Bush in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson also urged authorities to toss out &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws on Wednesday and highlighted what many see as racial bias in the U.S. justice system by drawing attention to the case of Marissa Alexander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander, a 32-year-old black woman, got a 20-year sentence for firing a bullet against a wall to scare off her abusive husband. The judge would not allow her to use a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; defense and it took the jury just 12 minutes to find her guilty of three counts of aggravated battery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In one case, Mr. Zimmerman kills a young man and walks away, free to kill again,&quot; Jackson told reporters soon after meeting Alexander in a Florida prison. &quot;Marissa shot no one, hurt no one, and she's in jail for 20 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Florida capital, Tallahassee, demonstrators occupied a part of the governor's office for the second straight day on Wednesday demanding that the state repeal &quot;Stand Your Ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">With her identity kept secret, the juror, designated B-37, gave an interview to CNN on Monday that stirred further debate in the case that captivated the U.S. public and triggered lengthy discussions about race, guns and vigilantism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia's Putin puts U.S. ties above Snowden</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW -- President Vladimir Putin signalled clearly on Wednesday that he did not want a dispute over the fate of former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden to derail Russia's relations with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia has ruled out extraditing Snowden, wanted by Washington for leaking details of U.S. surveillance programmes, and the U.S. citizen is currently stuck in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allowing him to stay in Russia even temporarily would upset Washington. Putin does not want to jeopardise a planned Moscow summit with President Barack Obama in September, their first in Russia since he started a new term last year, or cloud the atmosphere at a subsequent G20 summit in St Petersburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a refusal would open Putin to criticism at home that he gave into Moscow's former Cold War enemy, even though he has refused to extradite Snowden to the United States to face espionage charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked during a visit to the eastern Siberian town of Chita whether the affair would cast a shadow over a U.S.-Russia summit due in September in Moscow, Putin told reporters: &quot;Bilateral relations, in my opinion, are far more important than squabbles about the activities of the secret services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putin did not say whether Russia would grant Snowden's temporary asylum request, filed on Tuesday after more than three weeks at Sheremetyevo, but reiterated that he must agree to do nothing to harm the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We warned Mr Snowden that any action by him that could cause damage to Russian-American relations is unacceptable for us,&quot; the former KGB spy said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 17--Some people contend that the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin illustrates an inherent injustice of the American legal system -- one that's racially motivated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We disagree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We agree that Martin should still be alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we agree that he probably would be alive, had Zimmerman chosen to stay in his car rather than pursue the teenager that night in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as the trial testimony and the verdict clearly showed, Zimmerman's bad judgment does not make him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of murder or manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman had the right to follow Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some groups argue that the best solution is to have the federal government take up the case and prosecute Zimmerman for violating Martin's civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We disagree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no reason to believe federal officials would succeed where the Florida prosecutors failed. It defies logic to think that some mystery eyewitness will suddenly appear, or some evidence be uncovered to prove that Zimmerman is a raving racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A potential civil case is a different matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's family might well be able to prove Zimmerman's culpability, in part because the standard is lower in civil court -- a preponderance of the evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A civil suit is at least a legitimate way to continue this debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marauding the streets of Los Angeles and other cities, however, is not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using that decision as an excuse to break windows and steal from businesses, to attack innocent people and to block highways, is more of an insult to Martin's memory than the jury's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who are truly aggrieved by Zimmerman's acquittal are entitled, of course, to publicly protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they would bolster their credibility if, in addition to airing their beliefs about the verdict, they emphasized that violent and destructive protests serve no legitimate purpose and weaken, rather than strengthen, the protesters' position.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African-American faith leaders vowed Tuesday to harness anger over the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case to overturn &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; laws and reassert the case for greater civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking outside Department of Justice headquarters, Reverend Al Sharpton announced a National Justice for Trayvon Day for Saturday with rallies outside federal buildings and court houses in more than 100 cities nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People all over the country will gather to show that we are not having a two- or three-day anger fit,&quot; said the civil rights firebrand, flanked by more than a dozen other African-American clergy members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a social movement for justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton added that &quot;tens of thousands&quot; would converge on Washington for a protest march on August 24, the Saturday before the 50th anniversary of the late Martin Luther King's historic mass march on the US capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday's acquittal of gun-toting neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in the shooting death of unarmed Florida teenager Martin has stirred anger and unrest across the African-American community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton is pressing the Department of Justice to reopen a civil rights investigation into the incident that was suspended when Zimmerman was arrested six weeks after the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US Attorney General Eric Holder, calling Martin's death &quot;tragic and unnecessary,&quot; called Monday for a dialogue on the racially-charged issues it raises, but he stopped short of announcing civil proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton, founder of the National Action Network, pledged a major campaign against so-called stand-your-ground laws in Florida &quot;and 29 other states&quot; that allow citizens who feel threatened to use lethal force in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stand-your-ground law was not used directly at this (Zimmerman) trial, but it had everything to do with what happened at this trial,&quot; he said, adding that such laws represented &quot;a new threat to civil and human rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let us be clear. It is now because of these laws where anyone walking, committing no crime, can be followed or approached by another civilian, and they can use deadly force and say it was self-defense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is something that is frightening and cannot be allowed to sustain itself in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Setting out a strategy against stand-your-ground laws -- including a boycott of corporations known to support such legislation -- will be the topic of a three-day meeting of faith leaders in Miami next week, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, the Hollywood Reporter said Tuesday that pop music legend Stevie Wonder has vowed never to perform in any state or country with a stand-your-ground law on its statute books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I decided today that until the stand-your-ground law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again,&quot; it quoted Wonder as saying Sunday in Quebec City, where he was playing the Canadian city's summer festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tre Littlejohn, 16, an African-American high school student from Columbus, Ohio, happened upon Sharpton's sidewalk press conference Tuesday while touring Washington with a hometown church group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To me, I think the justice system is all messed up,&quot; he told AFP when asked what the Martin case meant to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I could go do something to someone of a different race and be prosecuted like that,&quot; he said, snapping his fingers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, the man (Zimmerman) was told (by a police dispatcher on the night of the incident) not to follow this kid, but he did anyway. I feel the whole situation is unfair not only to the children of our race, but also to the age groups under us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His cousin Daelon Norris, 14, said he was at home in Columbus when he learned of Zimmerman's acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My first reaction was, 'This is crazy',&quot; he said. &quot;He just killed an innocent boy who wanted some Skittles (candy). He should be placed in jail for life... This world is crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iran's English-language news channel Press TV led its 0500 gmt news bulletin on 17 July with a report on the United States' &quot;secret data collection programmes&quot;. It said 19 US organizations had filed a lawsuit in a California federal court against the National Security Agency, saying their constitutional rights were violated by the agency's &quot;spying&quot; activities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The channel's 0600 gmt news bulletin led with a call by an American civil rights activist for demonstrations across the country. The channel said the rallies were aimed at calling on the government to bring a civil rights case against George Zimmerman, who was recently found not guilty in the death of black teenager Trayvon Martin by a Florida jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The channel started its 0700 gmt newscast with a report on the Bahraini government's &quot;crackdown on anti-regime protesters&quot;. It said opposition group Al-Wifaq had accused &quot;Saudi-backed Bahraini forces&quot; of attacking the homes of protesters in several towns and villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A demonstration in Argentina against a planned agreement between a state-run oil and gas company and American energy firm Chevron was also a leading story on Press TV's morning bulletins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another report, Press TV said an investigation had found that Britain's National Health Service had failed to provide sufficient healthcare to patients, causing thousands of deaths. It said the investigation had found a series of problems including poor care, management mistakes and lack of staff at 14 hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The channel went on to report that the British government intended to maintain and renew its nuclear weapons programme. It said British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond had announced the news after Liberal Democrats published reviews for a less costly programme amid harsh austerity measures. Press TV said the Liberal Democratic Party had described the government's 25bn-pound like-for-like replacement of Trident nuclear weapons system as a &quot;Cold War&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tehran, 17 July: In reaction to the acquittal of the assailant of a black American, the Foreign Ministry spokesman [Seyyed Abbas Araqchi] said: &quot;The acquittal of the murderer [George Zimmerman] of the black American teenager [Trayvon Martin] has, again, openly displayed an unwritten, but systematic, racism against ethnic and religious minorities in the US society.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mehr news agency, Seyyed Abbas Araqchi said that the verdict has raised a serious question about the fairness of the judicial procedures in the United States, and added: &quot;After several months of investigations, the public opinion in America and the world expects to see transparency, careful and fair judicial probes, commitment to the human rights principles regarding the US citizens, and prohibition of any discrimination against minorities in that country.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Araqchi said: &quot;Pubic opinion interprets such kind of judicial practice as the continuation of some measures such as the suspicious death of [Malcolm Latif] Shabazz, the grandson of Malcolm X, which had been tried to sink the case into oblivion without any professional probes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;The Islamic Republic of Iran, in line with public opinion, advises the US government and judicial bodies to remain committed to their international and human rights duties in the country, particularly regarding minorities, and to take practical measures in order to put an end to discriminatory behaviours.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman walked free from a Florida courthouse this week having been cleared of the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Except that George is not, of course, free in any real sense of the word...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As his brother Robert has pointed out, Zimmerman will spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the case of the armed 29-year-old neighbourhood watch volunteer who shot dead an unarmed 17-year-old has become the latest, biggest smouldering controversy in America, threatening to ignite once again that country''s always volatile racial tensions. Zimmerman, who describes himself as Hispanic is, if you insist on being clinically precise about these things, actually mixed race - white and Hispanic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was black. Zimmerman had followed the youth after he saw him enter a gated community in Sanford, Orlando, and had challenged him. To protesters appalled at the verdict, what followed was a clearcut case of an armed white man shooting dead a young black lad purely because he assumed that the boy had to be up to no good on account of the colour of his skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others (including the all-female jury) accepted the smaller, pudgier Zimmerman''s story that the 6ft tall, well-built Trayvon, when challenged, had attacked him and pinned him to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that he (Zimmerman) had only gone for his gun in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida has a dubious Stand Your Ground law which allows people to defend themselves by force in their home or their place of work or anywhere &quot;they have a right to be&quot;. (Other US states have a similar law which does not go quite so far.) Zimmerman did not actually use Stand Your Ground as a defence in his court case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is cited as the reason why the police did not charge him with any crime for almost two months after the killing until public outcry led to action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And how much, you have to wonder, was it in George Zimmerman''s mind on that fateful night he encountered Trayvon&nbsp;Martin? ? How much did it propel him towards challenging the young man - who, as it turns out, was perfectly entitled to be within the gates of the compound? The Zimmerman case has been a complex, difficult one. I watched considerable television coverage of it when I was in America. It was a big, big talking point. And a deeply divisive one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From television coverage alone it was hard to judge. But it would be fair to say that over here, Zimmerman would have been unlikely to walk completely free from court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then again, over here he wouldn''t have been allowed to carry a gun in the first place. Once again, America''s insane gun laws claim a young life. On the streets though, the protests have not been about gun legislation. They have been about race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in our own place the deep fault line than runs through American society is still there gouged by centuries of seething mistrust, misconception, suspicion and hatred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has called for calm. Leaders here call for calm too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But calling for calm isn''t enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless what tears a community in two is faced up to, tackled, confronted and in some way healed and resolved it will continue to suppurate and separate. And people on both sides will never be free of the sores of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not in America. Not here.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PITTSFIELD -- Residents quietly took their turn in a nationwide protest Wednesday in Park Square, where they gathered for a candlelight vigil in honor of slain Florida teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it was my brother I would feel the same as Trayvon's brother -- I'd miss him,&quot; said 13-year-old Krystal Levey, who attended the evening ceremony with her grandmother, Shirley Burbridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burbridge spoke of George Zimmerman, the 29-year-old man who shot Martin to death in Sanford, Fla., last year and whose acquittal Saturday caused outrage in cities all over the country -- from Times Square in New York City to Oakland, Calif. -- this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Zimmerman was] a wannabe cop that took it too far,&quot; she said. &quot;There was no need to kill that kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the roughly 60 people who turned out on Wednesday held aloft handmade signs and clutched bags of Skittles -- the candy found on the teen the night he was killed, Feb. 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd circled the park and met in the middle, waiting to light their candles until the right moment: 7:17 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's date is seven-seventeen. [Martin] died at 7:17 p.m. We just want to light these candles for him and simply take a minute to think,&quot; said Toby Clayton, who organized the demonstration with his wife, Lisa. The two have a 17-year-old son -- the same age Martin was when he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clayton said he wanted to &quot;do as the Martin family asked: protest peacefully,&quot; in organizing the demonstration. The only turbulence came before the demonstration, when one resident arrived and began shouting at those who'd organized it. He claimed Martin was a &quot;thug&quot; who &quot;got what he deserved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one there at the time agreed, including Pete Wilson, of Great Barrington, and Hazel Scott, of Pittsfield, who shared a bench.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's great that there's some attention that's being given to this,&quot; Wilson said, as people began arriving. &quot;It's just a shame why we're here. I hope I don't have to come to another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott said he was dumbfounded by Saturday's verdict, which cleared Zimmerman of all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it was the wrong verdict,&quot; she said. &quot;I wish I was in that jury. Don't get me started.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was unarmed when Zimmerman shot him during an altercation between the two. Zimmerman's lawyers argued that their client acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With their candles lit, participants recited the Lord's Prayer in the park and walked its perimeter several more times before departing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public outrage and calls for civil suits and a federal investigation still hang over Zimmerman's head, pushed by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and other civil rights activists. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., said Monday that he opposes the so-called &quot;stand your ground&quot; law that proved key in Zimmerman's acquittal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday the future of the Voting Rights Act is in &quot;real jeopardy&quot; following the Supreme Court's decision striking down a portion of the law, telling a prominent organization of black women that Congress should act to preserve &quot;fairness and equality&quot; in the nation's voting system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former secretary of state was feted with chants of &quot;Run, Hillary, Run,&quot; as she concluded her 30-minute remarks to nearly 14,000 members of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, a historic black women's organization celebrating its 100th anniversary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, said the Supreme Court's decision &quot;struck at the heart&quot; of the landmark law and warned that it could undermine Americans' most fundamental rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless Congress acts, you know and I know, more obstacles are on their way,&quot; Clinton said, walking freely on stage instead of delivering her speech from a podium. &quot;They're going to make it difficult for poor people, elderly people, working people, minority people to be able to do what we should take for granted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A divided Supreme Court threw out a key part of the landmark Voting Rights Act in June, stripping the government of its best way to prevent voting bias - the requirement that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discrimination in voting, mostly in the South, get Washington's approval before changing the way they hold elections. The decision has been criticized by civil rights groups who contend it could undermine voting rights in upcoming elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton made no mention of any future political plans, saying she intends to promote early childhood development, the rights of women and girls around the globe and economic development in her new role in her family's presidential foundation. In a nod to the sea of women wearing crimson and cream, the organization's colors, Clinton quipped that &quot;in mathematics, delta means change. I think that's pretty fitting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But her speech emphasized the importance of voting rights for black Americans, who supported Barack Obama in large numbers during their Democratic primary campaign in 2008 and in his re-election last year. Black voters have long supported her husband, President Bill Clinton, and would be a key voting bloc if the former first lady sought the presidency in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to make sure that in the next election and the next election and the next and everyone after that, people line up to vote and they vote regardless of those who may not want to count their vote or acknowledge their right to vote,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She cited her work with civil rights leader Dorothy Height, recalled attending a speech by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as a young woman and noted the work of the late Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, a prominent member of the sorority. Clinton said the issue of voting rights resonated after she attended a congressional hearing on the issue with Tubbs Jones in Cleveland following the 2004 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea that in the 21st century African-Americans would wait in line to vote for 10 hours while whites in an affluent precinct next door waited just 10 minutes, or African-Americans would receive fliers telling the wrong time and wrong day to exercise their constitutional rights,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;That is not the America we would expect or the America we would want for our children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton opened her remarks by offering prayers for the family of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager who was killed last year, and &quot;with every family who loves someone who is lost to violence.&quot; She said the week's developments brought &quot;deep, painful heartache&quot; to many Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No mother, no father, should ever have to fear for their child walking down a street in the United States of America,&quot; Clinton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was her first public comments on the case since George Zimmerman's acquittal in the Martin case. The Justice Department has said it's considering whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges after Zimmerman's acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama met with members of the sorority in the Oval Office earlier in the day, including former Labor Secretary Alexis Herman and Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - Stand-your-ground laws that allow a person who believes he is in danger to use deadly force in self-defense &quot;sow dangerous conflict&quot; and need to be reassessed, Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday in assailing the laws that exist in many states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder said he was concerned about the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin slaying case in which Florida's stand-your-ground law played a part. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he added: &quot;Separate and apart from the case that has drawn the nation's attention, it's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman was acquitted over the weekend of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in Martin's 2012 death in Sanford, Fla. Holder said the Justice Department has an open investigation into what he called Monday the &quot;tragic, unnecessary shooting death&quot; of the unarmed Miami 17-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged the nation then to speak honestly about complicated and emotionally charged issues. A day later, he seemed to shift away from the specific case to one of those issues - the debate over stand-your-ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has always been a legal defense for using deadly force if - and the 'if' is important - no safe retreat is available,&quot; Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country must take a hard look at laws that contribute to &quot;more violence than they prevent,&quot; Holder said during a speech before an NAACP convention in Orlando, about 20 miles from the courthouse where Zimmerman was cleared of the charges three days earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such laws &quot;try to fix something that was never broken,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's shooting shined a light on Florida's stand-your-ground and similar laws around the nation. Most say a person has no duty to retreat if he is attacked in a place he has a right to be and can meet force with force if he fears death or great bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford's police chief cited the law as his reason for not initially arresting Zimmerman in February 2012. Zimmerman told police Martin was beating him up during the confrontation and that he feared he would be killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though stand-your-ground was never raised during trial, Judge Debra Nelson included a provision about the law in the instructions that allowed jurors to consider it as a legitimate defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we must examine laws that take this further by eliminating the common-sense and age-old requirement that people who feel threatened have a duty to retreat, outside their home, if they can do so safely,&quot; Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense skipped a chance to ask that Zimmerman have a stand-your-ground hearing before trial. If the judge had decided there was enough evidence that Zimmerman acted in self-defense, she could have tossed out the case before a jury heard it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stand-your-ground laws license vigilantism and we should all worry about that,&quot; said Benjamin Jealous, the NAACP's president and CEO, after Holder's speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder on Tuesday only briefly touched on a possible federal civil rights case being brought against Zimmerman. And legal experts say such a case would be a difficult challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors would have to prove that Zimmerman was motivated by racial animosity to kill Martin. The teen was on his way back to his father's fiancee's house after going to a store when the neighborhood watch volunteer saw him and followed him in the community of about 50,000, which is about one-third black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader Al Sharpton, who has been one of the most vocal champions of a federal investigation, acknowledged Tuesday there are possible legal hurdles. Still, he said &quot;there is also a blatant civil rights question of does Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and the Trayvon Martins of this country have the civil right to go home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday's acquittal has inspired &quot;Justice For Trayvon&quot; protests around the nation. Most have been peaceful, although vandalism and violence happened in Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of protesters carrying signs demanding justice for Martin crammed into the lobby of Florida Gov. Rick Scott's office Tuesday and refused to leave until the governor either met with them or called lawmakers back to Tallahassee to address issues like the state's stand-your-ground law. Many planned to spend the night in the Capitol building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the challenges of bringing a federal civil rights case, some NAACP members said they wanted swift action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Hickerson, an NAACP member from Seattle, said he would be disappointed if he doesn't see the Justice Department taking action within a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard what he (Holder) said, and I don't question his sincerity, but I'd like to see swift action in this case, and I haven't seen that yet,&quot; said Hickerson. &quot;His words were eloquent but I need to see some action before I get enthusiastic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added Hickerson, &quot;This is a very obvious case. How much thinking do you have to do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his comments referencing the Zimmerman case, Holder offered a story from his own personal experience - describing how when he was a young black man his father had told him how to interact with the police, what to say and how to conduct himself if he was ever stopped or confronted in a way he thought was unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure my father felt certain - at the time - that my parents' generation would be the last that had to worry about such things for their children,&quot; Holder told the NAACP convention. &quot;Trayvon's death last spring caused me to sit down to have a conversation with my own 15-year-old son, like my dad did with me. This was a father-son tradition I hoped would not need to be handed down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the interest in the George Zimmerman verdict and the fact that the NAACP and other groups are demanding federal action, we don't blame the Justice Department for assessing whether criminal civil rights charges might be legitimate now that Zimmerman has been acquitted. But we're deeply skeptical of proceeding with further charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same problems that hobbled the state in its pursuit of Zimmerman would face the Justice Department, beginning with the lack of witnesses to the deadly confrontation between Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there would be new problems, too. A civil rights charge would presumably require evidence that Zimmerman acted out of racial bias. Yet if hard evidence of such bigotry failed to surface in the past year and a half, it's hard to believe it would come to light now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, the Justice Department has played an important role historically in filing federal charges when a clear miscarriage of justice seems to have occurred in a case involving race. But if there was a miscarriage of justice here, it certainly isn't obvious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury's conclusions could not have been shocking to anyone who followed the case with an open mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, open minds and fair-minded attitudes have not been the hallmarks of the Trayvon Martin phenomenon since it burst into the national consciousness last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a video posted on YouTube, the 63-year-old singer said at a concert in Quebec City, Canada, on Sunday, &quot;that until the 'stand your ground' law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wonder added: &quot;Wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;stand your ground&quot; law allows people to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin during a February 2012 confrontation in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman said he fired his gun in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A six-member jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wonder's representative said the singer had no further comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - Nas has rapped his way to Harvard University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ivy League school announced Tuesday that the 39-year-old rapper is being honored with the Nasir Jones Hip-Hop Fellowship at its W.E.B. Du Bois Institute. It's a joint venture with Harvard's Hip-Hop Archive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fellowship will assist students who excel in the arts &quot;in connection with hip-hop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nas is one of hip-hop's most celebrated lyricists, best known for his reflective rhymes and deep storytelling. His 11th album, &quot;Life Is Good,&quot; was released last year. It earned four Grammy nominations. His hits include &quot;If I Ruled the World (Imagine That),&quot; &quot;Street Dreams&quot; and &quot;I Can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hip-Hop Archive was established at Harvard in 2002. It supports growing research in hip-hop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES (AP) - An expert who projected Michael Jackson could have earned more than $1 billion on his comeback concerts testified Tuesday that his analysis didn't include a breakdown of the singer's yearly earnings over his lifetime and projected a longer concert tour than the superstar had ever performed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arthur Erk, a certified public accountant who is an expert in musician's royalties, said his analysis didn't take into account thousands of pages of figures detailing Jackson's spending over the years. Erk is testifying for Jackson's mother in her lawsuit against AEG Live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erk's projec-tion that Jackson would have earned between $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion if he performed a 37-month, 260-show tour and crafted a Las Vegas show came under attack Tuesday by a lawyer for concert promoter AEG Live LLC. He said his figures were a conservative estimate of Jackson's earning potential if he had lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AEG Live attorney Sabrina Strong showed Erk a chart that showed that Jackson's three previous solo tours comprised 275 shows over a 10-year span. She challenged Erk's contention that he was being conservative by projecting Jackson would have performed 260 shows over a three-year period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strong also attacked Erk's calculation that Jackson would have spent $134 million between ages 50 and 65. She cited testimony from Jackson's former business managers and accountants in depositions that Jackson was historically outspending his earnings by millions of dollars each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson died an estimated $400 million in debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - The message of &quot;Here Comes Honey Boo Boo&quot; seems to be: Don't worry, be happy, consequences be damned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This devil-may-care philosophy seems to work fine for June Shannon and her outrageous household, at least as captured for the TLC reality show that burst on the scene last summer as a backwoods celebration of mischief-making, fart jokes and dietary excess that would rattle Paula Deen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It returns today at 8 p.m. with more of the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set in tiny McIntyre, Ga., the show continues to plunder Southern and rural stereotypes. On a hand-painted sign, &quot;Peaches&quot; is spelled &quot;Peches&quot; (proof that Southerners can't read or write). The soundtrack is larded with cornpone country music. And to reinforce the notion that this is an alien culture whose spoken tongue is unintelligible, the dialogue is often subtitled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here Comes Honey Boo Boo&quot; centers on Mama June, who, at 33, is a bleach-blond Buddha living with four daughters sired by four fathers, including &quot;Sugar Bear&quot; Mike, patriarch and father of title character Alana (aka Honey Boo Boo), who's a chunky hybrid of child stars Shirley Temple and Gary Coleman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To its credit, &quot;Boo Boo&quot; has a sweet tone. It remains a big-hearted show. The point of the show is to marvel at how these folks exist in the Now, a redneck state of Zen with no apparent regard for health, family planning, economic advancement or other issues imposed by an uncertain future. Theirs is a live-for-today lifestyle the audience is free to admire for the moxie it implies - while mocking them for their abject recklessness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that there aren't moments any viewer can relate to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, after a somewhat chaotic birthday party for Sugar Bear (the party theme: his favorite TV show, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;), he whisks the girls out of the house with designs on a little romance with his woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there's any chance of June being a little frisky,&quot; he reasons, &quot;it's on my birthday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their boudoir, he presents her with a cream-filled, candle-lit cupcake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June is unimpressed. &quot;A new crockpot, new deep fryer, might get you to first base,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the show's final moments, shot discreetly from out in the yard, viewers can hear June submitting with a line that would do justice to a top-notch sitcom: &quot;Just be quick!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As set-up as it seems, no scene in the hour rings truer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then again, most everything about it is super-sized - especially June, who, , whose dad is Mike (&quot;Sugar Bear&quot;), a 41-year-old chalk miner who serves as resident patriarch and de facto granddad to baby Kaitlyn, whose mother is June's 18-year-old daughter, Anna (&quot;Chickadee&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This brood of seven lives in a three-bedroom/one bath home and gets by, according to June, on $80 a week in grocery costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do they do it? June is an accomplished coupon-cutter and a thrifty homemaker who, in the season premiere, scores a culinary coup: a dead hog struck by a car up the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not really hunters in our family,&quot; she explains, so road kill is always welcome. &quot;We bring it home, skin it, cook it, eat it, save money. That's the way the cycle of life works in our family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warning: Watching them prepare the family's pork-and-beans feast could turn you into a vegan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However hard-pressed, the family has its share of fun - although some of the hijinks seem staged for the reality-TV lens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one scene, Alana, 13-year-old Lauryn (&quot;Pumpkin&quot;) and 16-year-old Jessica (&quot;Chubbs&quot;) wrap themselves in plastic bags, pour cooking oil on the floor, grease themselves all over with gobs of butter and turn the house into what they call &quot;Redneck Slip 'n Slide - Extreme Home Edition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They and the house are soon an oozy mess. But it may be the most benign use of butter ever seen on the show. Reflecting the family's high-cholesterol regimen, Alana recites what to her must seem like the three major food groups: &quot;butter, sketti (spaghetti) and ketchup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, it was her participation in beauty pageants on TLC's &quot;Toddlers &amp; Tiaras&quot; that snagged her a series of her own, and she makes the most of her stardom to a degree beyond brattiness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following in the family tradition, she is a specialist in jokes inspired by flatulence, such as when she boasts that her secret pro-wrestling move &quot;would be the Cup-a-Fart: You fart in your hand and throw it at the enemy's face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this really the way for a 7-year-old to be encouraged to behave? Sure, when it serves the interests of a reality-TV show. A viewer may cringe at what may lie ahead for her when the cameras are gone and the audience's amusement at her overwrought bid for attention has passed. But there's no point in worrying about tomorrow. No one appearing on this show ever seems to.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too much mystery surrounding Boston bombings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor of the Reformer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm convinced that the Boston Bombings were an intelligence operation. I hope Judy Clarke doesn't convince her client, suspected bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, to plead guilty and prevent us from hearing his story in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given Boston FBI head Richard DesLauriers running of Operation Ghost Stories, the 10-year monitoring and roll-up of a Russian spy network, in which &quot;FBI agents posed as Russian handlers,&quot; I think it's unimaginable that the FBI wasn't dogging the Tsarnaev brothers for three to five years, as their mother has said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's the uncle's connection with CIA agent Graham Fuller; the fact that both brothers were transported all the way across town to Beth Israel Deaconess hospital; Dr. Schoenfeld's bizarre interview with NPR. Then there's Ron Dermer, saying that the bombings would be good for Israel; the fact that the scenario was almost identical to the 2013 Boston Urban Shield Drill, run by Cytel Group, which is using the bombings as advertising on their website, and the fact that Urban Shield events have been supported by Israel in three different ways; Cytel Group's connection with Hollywood effects company Strategic Operations, run by Stu Segall, allegedly a former porn king with mob ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I actually drove to the scene of the shootout, because I couldn't reconcile two eyewitness statements and was surprised to see so many bullet holes in houses at the second floor level. Then I was astonished when I saw the house where the boat was parked. I had listened to a young woman tell an infowars reporter: &quot;My friend on Franklin St., ummm, lived across the street, and the Army people did a huge search in their garage, ummm, but the boat was directly across the street; they didn't search the boat, not once. They didn't even go around it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumably they didn't go near Dave Henneberry's carriage house behind the boat either, or the detached garage in the neighbor's backyard. Then, there's Leah Flynn, who, according to online white pages, lives at 20 Franklin St., a block and a half past Henneberry's house on the L-shaped street, who said that law enforcement officers were in her backyard. So, we've been lied to about the &quot;perimeter&quot; and its relationship to the boat. I think the site was being guarded until the experiment with martial law was over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's the huge omission in Dave Henneberry's story with regards to the giant door that was built into the shrink wrapping on the boat. There's a video online atbusinessweek.com in which you can watch a police vehicle/apparatus peel back the door -- which I'm assuming is what Henneberry pantomimed rolling up, in his interview with WCVB's Ed Harding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think the whole boat story is fishy -- including the note allegedly scrawled therein, which seems to get longer and longer and which we only first heard about a month after the bombings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is only the tip of the iceberg of things related to this story which I find odd ....</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putney, July 11</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food violence must be stopped</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor of the Reformer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman verdict was absolutely correct. He was defending himself against a 17-year-old black male armed with two deadly weapons, a box of skittles and a water bottle. We all know that these are life threatening instruments. What choice did Zimmerman have? If they had found him guilty, the next attack might well be a Latino with a box of milk duds and a root beer. This food violence must be stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Fagelson,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putney, July 16</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Zimmerman, Martin editorial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor of the Reformer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have two issues with the July 16 Reformer editorial concerning the Zimmerman trial. One, there is no proof that Trayvon Martin was doing anything but walking down the street in the gated Florida neighborhood. His dark skin was the only thing that made him stand out. Had a white person walked into a black neighborhood in Florida and been shot to death, the killer most likely would have had a tougher time with an all-white jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two, it took me almost five minutes to understand the meaning of: &quot;Ultimately, the editorial board doesn't believe this needs to be relegated to nothing more than a race issue, despite what many on both side of the argument say.&quot; The sentence contains a double negative, along with the singular use of &quot;side&quot; when it should be plural. This is another case in a long line of what I call &quot;must of&quot; grammatical errors found in issues of the Reformer (the Reformer constantly uses &quot;must of&quot; instead of &quot;must have&quot;). While I understand the deadline pressures a newspaper faces, if you have a point of view that you consider important, give it enough respect to state it clearly and with correct grammar. Otherwise your readers will assume the writer is not intelligent and will assume the opinion is not worth their time. I am sure that is not your intent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brattleboro, July 16</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The abominable Snowden</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor of the Reformer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward Snowden is not a human rights activist, he is a loathsome (abominable) traitor and spy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated his aim was to inform the world about the surveillance programs operated by the NSA. He expressed concern theU.S.government could monitor the communications of the U.S. public, but he did not say it occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Snowden is the activist who just wanted to expose the possible monitoring of the U.S. public, why did he go to Hong Kong (China), a totalitarian country opposed to democratic values and freedoms? Why did he go to China with his four laptops filled with NSA information, and probably allow the Chinese to copy the NSA material?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Snowden was concerned with theU.S.government infringing on our freedoms, why did he go to Russia, another totalitarian country opposed to our democratic values, a country who most likely copied the NSA information on his laptops?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowden could be a disgruntled individual who decided to get even with the U.S. over personal problems, possibly work related. His aim is to harm our national security. He should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for breaking the trust we placed in him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A photo tweeted by Panama's President Ricardo Martinelli on July 16, 2013, shows what he says are &quot;undeclared weapons&quot; hidden under the sugar cargo of North Korean container ship ''Chong Chon Gang'' in Colon. Panama has detained the North Korean-flagged ship coming from Cuba as it approached the Panama Canal, Martinelli said. REUTERS/Panamian Presidency/Handout via Reuters (HANDOUT)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEOUL, South Korea - North Korea, as usual, looks menacing, but can't seem to keep its black ops under wraps. On Wednesday, Cuba came forward as the culprit behind a stash of weapons bound for North Korea. Panamanian authorities uncovered the illicit cargo last week-hidden in a shipment of brown sugar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cuban foreign ministry claimed the obsolete, Soviet-made weapons, which included two fighter jets and the parts for anti-aircraft missiles, were being sent to Pyongyang for repair. United Nations sanctions prohibit the sales of arms to North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether or not that's a violation, this isn't the first time the pariah state has been caught ferrying weapons, drugs, and other illicit goods around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, when it comes to keeping secrets, the world's most reclusive regime has a terrible track record. Here's a list of other high-profile blunders.Paradise lost in ThailandM</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 2009, Thai authorities seized a North Korean airplane on a refueling stop in Bangkok. What did they find? Forty tons of weapons that included grenades, rocket launchers, and other lethal cargo-along with all sorts of bizarre-looking tubes and devices used to put together arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police and intelligence officials stayed silent on the cargo's final destination, and it's not clear if they ever came to a firm conclusion. The five-person crew consisted of four people from Kazakhstan and one from Belarus. Many pundits speculated the firearms were headed for Iran, and that the aircraft originally planned to make a refueling stop in Sri Lanka instead of Thailand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A boneheaded move? Yes. Analysts pointed out that a North Korean airplane would have been smarter to land right next door in Myanmar, home to a friendly military regime with nuclear ties. Thailand is historically an American ally, and upholds UN sanctions against the isolated state.Diplomatic drug lords</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This one goes way back. Ever since the late 1970s, North Korean diplomats have been occasionally caught in countries like Egypt and Norway traveling with illicit drugs and counterfeit money.show more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, accusations that North Korean diplomats were peddling narcotics surfaced again in a conservative South Korean newspaper, the Chosun Ilbo, although the allegations could not be verified this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Andrei Lankov, a North Korea scholar, says this all began when North Korea became the first communist state to default on its international loans in the late 1970s. The debacle pretty much ended any hope for a state that justified its rule on Stalinist, egalitarian promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Korean embassies lacked the funds to stay afloat, so diplomats had to raise cash on their own. Plus, drugs offered hard currency to the cash-strapped regime. Hashish and cocaine, sadly, were in demand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the legal and diplomatic risks, it's surprising that North Korea would fly its own flag when transporting weapons from Cuba. Ten years ago, that wouldn't have been the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To escape the eyes of the world in the 1990s, the pariah state took advantage of an obscure &quot;flag of convenience&quot;: Cambodia. One Pyongyang official partnered with the Cambodian Shipping Corporation, a company that shipped drugs and weapons under a Cambodian flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's no longer possible. In 2002, the Spanish navy found one Cambodian ship to be carrying 15 SCUD missiles underneath bags of cement. The Cambodian dictator, Hun Sen, came under pressure from the United States and South Korea to end ties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airlines' threat to sue a Bay Area TV station over its airing of bogus, racially insensitive names of Asiana's flight crew represents the South Korean airline's latest perplexing response to the crash of Flight 214 at a time when it should be focusing on reassuring a nervous flying public, experts in crisis communications say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After its Boeing 777 landed short at San Francisco International Airport on July 6, killing three young passengers and injuring 182 others, Asiana has made several communications missteps, according to experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That makes it difficult to predict how South Korea's second-largest airline will respond going forward as the National Transportation Safety Board continues to investigate -- and what Asiana will say once the NTSB determines the cause of the crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The name Asiana is now etched in everyone's mind as a crash that fell short of the SFO runway,&quot; said Glenn F. Bunting, who runs G.F. Bunting, a San Francisco-based strategic communications company that specializes in crisis management. &quot;There's very little the company can say to change that in the short run. What they can do about it is begin to aggressively attack and repair their reputation problem. The way to do that is not to remain silent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asiana officials did not respond to repeated email and telephone requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an era of real-time social media, Asiana's responses have played out on a global stage.show more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SimpliFlying, an airline consulting firm, praised federal investigators and SFO for quick statements on the crash and constant social media updates -- while crash followers grew increasingly frustrated by the muted response from Asiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, Asiana Airlines, with the world's eyes set on it, was slow to respond and was far from satisfying the insatiable need for more information in the hours after the crash,&quot; SimpliFlying wrote in its analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, Asiana offered information on its veteran pilot, who was making his first landing in a Boeing 777 at SFO, and his trainer, who also was on his first flight as a trainer. A day after the crash, the company in South Korea apologized to victims and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But three days after the crash, Asiana Chief Executive Yoon Young-doo landed at SFO and could have shown quiet leadership by making a simple statement through a spokesman that he would not speak publicly because he needed to focus on the injured, the survivors, his crew and his customers, said Chuck Byers, who teaches marketing and public relations at Santa Clara University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Yoon declined to speak to the South Korean and U.S. reporters who mobbed him at the airport, and no one spoke on his behalf, giving the impressions he had something to hide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You put the senior executive in charge in front of the cameras to answer all questions forcibly and candidly,&quot; Bunting said. &quot;That portrays confidence and assures the public this was a freak thing and they should have full confidence to fly that airline. Scurrying from cameras and dodging the media and refusing to answer questions -- none of that is a display of confidence or reassures people they're flying a safe airline. It sends a message to the contrary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remains of the Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 have been and continue to be moved to a remote parking area at the San Francisco International Airport. (Dan Honda/Bay Area News Group)Jee-Eun Song studies South Korean culture as a lecturer in Asian studies at UC Berkeley and believes Asiana officials may have thought their initial apology to victims and their families in South Korea would cover them in San Francisco in the days following the crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a global economy monitored by 24/7 social media, Yoon's behavior at SFO was a mistake that goes beyond Asian or Western culture, Byers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I were their public relations director, I would have a Korean consultant and a North American consultant and a European consultant and an African consultant because the world is getting smaller and smaller and every story is global and every story is local,&quot; Byers said. &quot;I'm sure that Asiana has some very good counsel and advice but I've seen this kind of management problem in places other than the East. It's almost like a Western management problem that got translated to the East.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day after Yoon arrived, six of the flight's 12 flight attendants appeared at a puzzling news conference in which none of them spoke and even their Korean interpreter declined to be identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some hid their faces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Korea,&quot; Song said, &quot;to want to remain anonymous is pretty typical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But why organize a news conference in which the participants appear reluctant to attend?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a head-scratcher,&quot; Byers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then this week Asiana's focus, at least in public, turned to an embarrassing news story Friday in which television station KTVU reported bogus and culturally insensitive names for the four pilots on board, such as &quot;Sum Ting Wong&quot; and &quot;Wi Tu Lo.&quot; The station has apologized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asiana said it plans to sue KTVU but not the NTSB, which has acknowledged a summer intern &quot;acted outside the scope of his authority&quot; when he erroneously confirmed the names of the crew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he had been asked whether Asiana should sue anyone over the KTVU report, Bunting would have told them: &quot;It's clear that KTVU was the victim of a prank. (Filing suit) obviously flies in the face of the First Amendment protections we have here. I wonder if this isn't a clash of cultures.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People attend a vigil for slain youth Trayvon Martin, as well as to protest the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting death of Martin in Florida last year, in the Harlem area of New York, July 16, 2013. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO, Fla./NEW YORK -- Prosecutors in the George Zimmerman trial came under more scrutiny on Tuesday, threatened by a lawsuit from a witness while Attorney General Eric Holder renewed hints the federal government may pick up where the Florida prosecution failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, remained in hiding on Tuesday after a jury of six anonymous women on Saturday found him not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter, ending a Florida state prosecution of a case that has captivated and polarized the U.S. public on issues of race, gun and self-defense laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former employee at the Florida State Attorney office is preparing a whistleblower lawsuit against Zimmerman's prosecutors after testifying that they failed to turn over evidence he obtained from Martin's cell phone to the defense, his attorney told Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting in the central Florida town of Sanford on February 26, 2012, prompted street demonstrations last year when police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman, and the verdict provoked renewed marches from critics saying Zimmerman racially profiled Martin as a criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's defense team have complained repeatedly that race was wrongly injected into the case and that Zimmerman acted in self-defense, accusing civil rights leaders of inflaming racial passions with their calls for a federal investigation of Zimmerman on civil rights grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In California, police and civic leaders braced for further unrest while appealing for calm on Tuesday after nearly two dozen protesters in Los Angeles and Oakland were arrested during a second night of civil disturbances sparked by the not-guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the six jurors, identified only as juror number B-37, told CNN on Monday she did not think Zimmerman racially profiled Martin and believed Martin attacked Zimmerman first. The entire panel - five white women and one Hispanic woman - believed race played no role in the case, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B-37's interview with CNN, her faced blacked out in silhouette, prompted extreme reactions including death threats on social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder, the chief U.S. prosecutor and an appointee of President Barack Obama, told the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Orlando on Tuesday that his office would continue its investigation of the case, which could possibly lead to federal charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I,&quot; he said emphatically, &quot;am concerned about this case.&quot;show more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder called for a review of self-defense laws like the one in Florida that appeared to play a role in his acquittal. According to the jury's instructions, Zimmerman had &quot;no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force&quot; if he reasonably feared for his life or great bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder, who is black, also related personal stories about being racially profiled as a young adult and stopped by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon's death last spring caused me to sit down and have a conversation with my own 15-year-old son, like my dad did with me,&quot; Holder said. &quot;This was a father-son tradition I hoped would not need to be handed down.&quot;MORE PROTESTS PLANNED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader Al Sharpton called a &quot;Justice for Trayvon Day,&quot; planning a further 100 demonstrations in 100 cities on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People from all over the country will gather to show that we are not having a two- or three-day anger fit. This is a social movement for justice,&quot; Sharpton told reporters in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lead defense lawyer Mark O'Mara on Monday called the prosecution team a disgrace to the legal profession for holding back evidence that should have been promptly shared with the defense team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Kruidbos, a former director of information technology at State Attorney Angela Corey's Tallahassee-area prosecutor's office, is preparing a whistleblower lawsuit against the prosecutors after testifying that they failed to turn over evidence he obtained from Martin's cellphone while still employed by Corey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will be filing a whistleblower action in (Florida's Fourth Judicial District) Circuit Court,&quot; said Kruidbos' attorney Wesley White, himself a former prosecutor who was hired by Corey but resigned in December because he disagreed with her prosecutorial priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Corey nor lead prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda immediately responded to requests for comment on White's charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Corey referred Reuters to Kruidbos' termination letter, previously made public, in which Corey's office accused him of hacking confidential information from state computers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kruidbos testified last month in a pretrial hearing that he found embarrassing photos on Martin's phone that included pictures of a clump of jewelry on a bed, underage nude females, marijuana plants and a hand holding a semiautomatic pistol.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle Schneider and Dave Dunn use treadmill desks at Evolent, a health-care startup in Arlington, Va. Researchers are trying to determine whether the equipment allows people to burn off glucose that accumulates in the bloodstream. (Lexey Swall/for The Washington Post)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Jensen, a researcher at the Mayo Clinic, is talking on the phone, but his voice is drowned out by what sounds like a vacuum cleaner. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm on a treadmill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Dunstan, an Australian researcher, uses a speakerphone so he can walk around his office at the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not that Jensen and Dunstan are hyperactive. Rather, both are exercise researchers looking into the link between sitting down and premature death. And what they have found is disturbing enough that they both make sure they spend most of the day on their feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jensen explains that he and his colleagues at Mayo, in Rochester, Minn., were studying weight control when they discovered that some people &quot;spontaneously start moving round and don't gain weight&quot; when they have overeaten. These people don't dash to the gym; they just walk more, hop up from the couch to run errands or find other excuses to get onto their feet. &quot;This really got us thinking about this urge to move,&quot; Jensen says, &quot;and how important that might be for maintaining good health.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That led them to a field known as &quot;inactivity research,&quot; which suggests that inactivity, particularly sitting, can be very bad for your health. It might sound like a statement of the obvious, but the killer point is this: Inactivity is bad for you even if you exercise. Heading to the gym is not a license to spend the rest of the day on your backside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, a team led by Alpa Patel of the American Cancer Society in Atlanta analyzed the data from a 14-year study of 123,000 middle-aged adults. When they compared mortality rates of those who spent six hours a day or more sitting and those who reported three or fewer hours - and when they took into account other factors such as diet - they found something surprising: Extra time on the couch was associated with a 34 percent higher mortality rate for women and 17 percent higher for men in the 14 years after they joined the study. It is not clear why there is such a big sex difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another study, a team at the University of Queensland in Australia analyzed data on the television viewing habits of 8,800 Australians. They calculated that each hour of television correlated with 22 minutes off the average life expectancy of an adult older than 25. In other words, people who watch six hours of television a day face the prospect of dying, on average, about five years younger than those who don't watch any.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many other studies have reached similar conclusions. In a review of all the evidence, Dunstan's team concluded that there was a &quot;persuasive case&quot; that excessive sitting &quot;should now be considered an important stand-alone component of the physical activity and health equation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message is clear: Sitting still for hours at a time might be a health risk regardless of what you do with the rest of your day.show more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as you cannot compensate for smoking 20 cigarettes a day by a good run on the weekend, a bout of high-intensity exercise may not cancel out the effect of watching TV for hours on end. Patel's study found that people who spent hours sitting had a higher mortality rate even if they worked out for 45 to 60 minutes a day. The researchers call these people &quot;active couch potatoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is not just sitting on the couch that worries them. If the harm comes primarily through the inactivity itself - discounting sleep, which brings its own health benefits - the researchers suspect that watching TV, reading a novel or sitting at a desk may be just as harmful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sobering reality,&quot; Dunstan says, &quot;is that across a 14- or 15-hour waking day, we're getting 55 to 75 percent sedentary time. Moderate to vigorous activity - what people like to call 'exercise' - occupies just 5 percent or less of people's days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not the lifestyle to which the human body is adapted. &quot;From an evolutionary point of view, we are built to be active,&quot; says Audrey Bergouignan, a human physiologist at the University of Colorado at Denver. &quot;Your grandparents were not going to the fitness center. They were active all day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of Bergouignan's research involves bed-rest studies funded by space agencies. They are primarily concerned with the effects of low gravity on astronauts, but the results also apply to earthbound inactivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a typical study, healthy and previously active volunteers are confined to bed for anything from a day to three months. &quot;They develop metabolic features very close to what we observe in obese people and people with Type 2 diabetes,&quot; Bergouignan says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The studies reveal that inactivity produces a complex cascade of metabolic changes. For example, unused muscles not only atrophy but also shift from endurance-type muscle fibers that can burn fat to fast-twitch fibers that rely more strongly on glucose. Inactive muscles also lose mitochondria, the cells' power packs, which can also burn fat. With the muscles relying more on carbohydrates for what little work they are doing, unburned lipids accumulate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your blood is going to become very fatty,&quot; Bergouignan says, which could be why sitting has been linked to heart disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other changes involve insulin resistance, a diabetes-like condition in which glucose accumulates in the bloodstream even when the body produces insulin to sequester it. All of this happens very quickly in the astronaut studies. &quot;In three days we have insulin resistance,&quot; Bergouignan says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar effects, she adds, occurred in a study in which normally active people were asked to curtail their exercise, in essence spending a few weeks imitating their sedentary friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what can people do to avoid this, other than quitting their desk jobs and taking up nursing, hairdressing, waiting tables or other jobs that require them to be on their feet?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, it is important to note that exercise still has great benefits: An hour's workout cannot undo hours of sitting, but it is still good for your health. Patel's &quot;active couch potatoes&quot; fared better than people who sat a lot and did not go to the gym.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a message exercise advocates don't want to get lost. &quot;We know that if you exercise 40 to 60 minutes a day, you're going to have a health benefit,&quot; says Icigo San Millcn, director of the Human Performance Laboratory at the University of Colorado Hospital's Sports Medicine Clinic in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunstan agrees. &quot;We shouldn't throw out the well-documented benefits of vigorous physical activity,&quot; he says. Rather, we should think of extensive sitting as a risk factor that should be addressed separately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his latest experiments, Dunstan has been bringing people into his lab so that he and his team can find out precisely what works. In a study published last year, volunteers visited on three separate days. The first visit, they simply sat watching TV. On the other two, they watched TV but stood up three times an hour to spend two minutes on a treadmill. One day they went at an easy pace; on the other, they walked more briskly. On each visit they were given lunch with a sugary drink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scientists discovered that short activity breaks reduced the volunteers' blood sugar and insulin spikes after the drink by roughly 25 percent. &quot;That is a good thing,&quot; Dunstan says. &quot;We want to avoid those big spikes.&quot; Even more interestingly, ambling on the treadmill was just as effective as more energetic walking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jensen thinks that what makes these short bouts of activity effective is that they're enough to burn off some of the glucose that has accumulated in your bloodstream. &quot;Your bloodstream isn't that big,&quot; he says. &quot;In the whole body it's only five liters.&quot; For non-diabetics, that translates to less than 10 grams of glucose in the bloodstream. &quot;If you just burn off four grams - 16 calories - that's a lot of glucose you've taken out of the bloodstream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy to burn 16 calories simply by pacing around the room. That's also a really good way to clear the mind. &quot;People who get up and move around for five minutes every hour are every bit as productive as people who sit there for hours at a time,&quot; Jensen says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next step, adds Dunstan, is to determine the best ways to build activity breaks into the day. Is it better to have frequent short breaks? Or less-frequent, longer ones? Are treadmill desks and adjustable-height workstations even better, allowing people to switch from sitting to standing or walking as they work? At home, the questions are similar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are working on the computer, Dunstan suggests, &quot;take a break and do the dishes.&quot; If you are watching TV, get up and move around every 20 minutes, or whenever there's a break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patel adds that this may actually come as good news to the millions of people who have not been able to get close to the recommended daily exercise levels. &quot;The nice take-home message,&quot; she says, &quot;is that anything is better than nothing. Just getting up and moving at all is taking a big step in the right direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is easy to understand how everyone in the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman case feels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I were Martin's mother, I'd want his killer's heart on a platter. If I were Zimmerman's mother, I'd be grateful my son escaped greater injury, however he managed. If I were African-American, I would fear for my sons and be furious at a system that condones vigilantism, and then acts as though naming a teen's death a &quot;tragedy&quot; ends the discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list could go on. The point is that this is one of those rare instances in which everyone is right within his/her own experience. Blacks are right to perceive that Martin was followed because he was black, but it is wrong to presume that recognizing a racial characteristic is necessarily racist. It has been established that several burglaries in Zimmerman's neighbourhood involved primarily young black males. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Picture Zimmerman's neighbour and defence witness, Olivia Bertalan, hiding in her locked bedroom with her infant and a pair of rusty scissors, while two young males, later identified as African-American, burglarized her home. They ran when police arrived. This is not to justify what subsequently transpired between Zimmerman and Martin, but to cast a dispassionate eye on reality. And no, just because a few black youths caused trouble doesn't mean all black youths should be viewed suspiciously. This is so obvious a truth that it shouldn't need saying, and yet, if we are honest, we know that human nature includes the accumulation of evolved biases based on experience and survival. In the courtroom, it's called profiling. In the real world, it's called common sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing we can all agree upon without much strain is that this incident - this senseless, heartbreaking death - never should have happened. Zimmerman, who began acting as a watchman in 2004 and had made more than 40 calls to authorities over the years, never should have left his car once he had notified police, who told him to stay put.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also can surmise that Zimmerman would not have followed Martin if Zimmerman weren't carrying a gun. If Martin were perceived as dangerous, wouldn't an unarmed individual keep his distance until police arrived? Thus, we conclude that Zimmerman's actions led to the confrontation that ultimately resulted in a fight that ended with the fatal shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It never should have happened. And it didn't have to. The jury obviously felt that Zimmerman acted in self-defence or, at least, that the state failed to prove otherwise. It must have been a terrible conclusion to reach because, no matter what the legal definitions that guided them, it seems impossible that someone's young son, guilty of nothing, should die while his killer walks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, yes, we understand how everyone feels. But feelings are like weather - they come and go and shift with time. Part of maturity - and fundamental to civilization - is learning to process feelings through thought, reflection and, in this case, debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, in the wake of the Zimmerman verdict, feelings have been magnified and exploited by enablers - from certain members of the media, who seem more like rapacious rabble-rousers than journalists, to professional activists who, in fact, thrive on disorder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a good time to recognize that activists with television shows are not, in fact, journalists. When Al Sharpton went to Florida to organize demands that Zimmerman be charged, he was acting as the civil rights activist he is, not as a broadcast journalist he plays on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With such instigation, grassroots quickly erupt into wildfires. News organizations can't ignore news, obviously, but which came first: The death threats? Or the TV correspondent speculating whether Zimmerman would need to fear for his life? As soon as passions cool, assuming we let them, the discussion that needs to take place surrounds a question: What was George Zimmerman doing walking around his neighbourhood armed and loaded? In what world is this normal behaviour? The answer: Not a world most of us want to live in. Let's start there.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcry over the acquittal of George Zimmerman by a Florida jury has been heard from New York to Los Angeles to Milwaukee to Madison. Supporters of civil rights are, as NAACP President Ben Jealous says, &quot;outraged and heartbroken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a message posted on the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's website, Jealous declared, &quot;We are not done demanding justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's vital is that civil rights groups are turning their disappointment toward appropriate calls to action in the killing of the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday afternoon, the Department of Justice announced that the case was under review. &quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction,'' read a department statement, adding that the review would determine ''whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The formal language describes a first step that, while it is encouraging for civil rights organizations, does not ensure that the Justice Department will seek justice for Trayvon by filing civil rights charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP and other groups are arguing that there are clear grounds for intervention by the department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the NAACP campaign to get the Justice Department to open a civil rights case against Zimmerman, Jealous urged Americans to sign a petition to Attorney General Eric Holder that declares: &quot;The most fundamental of civil rights - the right to life - was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. We ask that the Department of Justice file civil rights charges against Mr. Zimmerman for this egregious violation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 350,000 Americans signed the petition within hours. And other civil rights groups echoed the demand for Justice Department action. Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law President Barbara Arnwine said that while the verdict &quot;represents a tragic miscarriage of justice,&quot; she believes &quot;there is still the potential for justice to be served through a civil suit brought about by Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's surviving family members, and also through civil rights charges being brought against Mr. Zimmerman by the Department of Justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to pressing for action at the federal level, the NAACP and other groups were turning attention to state capitols.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jealous coupled his announcement of the petition with a call for the outlawing of racial profiling and a renewed commitment to &quot;fight for the removal of stand-your-ground laws in every state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida passed its stand-your-ground law in 2005. Since then, at the behest of the National Rifle Association and the American Legislative Exchange Council, variations on the legislation - which allows individuals who say they believe they're in imminent danger to use deadly force - have been enacted by states across the country. After the killing of Trayvon on Feb. 26, 2012, as media outlets in Florida and nationally have reported: &quot;Police initially did not charge Zimmerman with a crime, citing Florida's stand-your-ground law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who faced charges only after a national outcry forced a review of the case, did not mount a specific stand-your-ground defense. But the issue remained a bone of contention before and during his trial; notably, the jury heard from a witness who recalled teaching about Florida's law in a college course that the defendant completed in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sustained outcry over the shooting of Trayvon appears to have led the NRA and ALEC to halt advocacy on behalf of stand-your-ground laws. But the laws continue to influence criminal justice nationwide, as the Madison-based Center for Media and Democracy has documented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP, the Urban League, and Color of Change were among many groups that pressed ALEC on the stand-your-ground issue in 2012. Several groups are urging legislators to strike the laws from state statute books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida's dangerous 'shoot first' law allowed Trayvon's killer to walk free without charges for more than a month. Shoot first legalizes vigilante homicide, has demonstrated racial bias in its application, and has led to an increase in gun-related deaths in the more than two dozen states where it has been passed into law,&quot; argues Color of Change. &quot;These laws give individual gun owners a greater right to shoot and kill than the rules of engagement for our military during times of war grant to soldiers in war zones. 'Shoot first' must be repealed now to protect families and communities and prevent senseless deaths.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referencing a Texas A&amp;M study that revealed how stand-your-ground and castle doctrine laws have been linked to increased rates of homicide, the NAACP's Jealous has said that &quot;stand-your-ground legislation does more harm than good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Too often these laws provide cover for vigilantes and hate groups who choose to take the law into their own hand,&quot; he argued in 2012. &quot;They have led to an increase in homicides, and people of color seem to always get caught in the crossfire.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The view of a criminal case by those who follow it every day from a jury box is often quite different from the one absorbed by those watching the TV accounts.&quot; We wrote that in this space two years ago, after Casey Anthony's acquittal. The same can be said about last weekend's outcome of another nationally covered Florida murder trial - the acquittal of community watch volunteer George Zimmerman on charges of manslaughter and second-degree murder in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the Anthony case, the Zimmerman case involves race - an additional combustible element that makes it even harder for Americans to calm down and avoid snap judgments. But Americans will have to do just that - calm down, think and discuss their concerns rationally - if they want Martin's death to have meaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This tragedy started with Zimmerman's snap judgment that an African-American teenager - who was actually living in the same gated community as Zimmerman and coming back from an evening snack run - was a &quot;punk&quot; who didn't belong there and was likely up to no good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman showed recklessness and atrocious judgment by getting out of his car after he had called the police, and had been clearly told by a dispatcher that he didn't need to follow Martin. But it was still a huge challenge for prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman, while in a brawl with Martin, had no reason to fear for his life and reach for his gun. The acquittal, which came after the jury deliberated 16 hours, didn't surprise legal experts who followed the case - even if many who dipped in and out of the blanket coverage on cable news found the verdict infuriating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like truth, justice is elusive. It may not have been done in this case - as in many others we can think of. But the legal process, which is justifiably tilted toward protecting the rights of defendants, was followed. President Barack Obama put it about as well as anyone could: &quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president then referred to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents, whose conduct throughout was exemplary: &quot;I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son. And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our communities.&quot; Every reputable community leader we know of, here and elsewhere, said something similar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be emotionally satisfying to yell, and to preach to people in your particular group who already agree with you. But the only long-term result is that you get hoarse, and those in the larger community tune you out. Nothing of consequence is accomplished without honest discussion that crosses racial and social lines. Having such a discussion would be a good monument for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As about 70 people walked from Annapolis' City Dock to Lawyers Mall Tuesday evening, they chanted &quot;save our children&quot; and &quot;justice for Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a less than 24 hours, Cynthia Carter, a former Annapolis alderwoman, had organized a march in memory of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the African-American Florida teenager who was shot to death by George Zimmerman in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who said he was acting in self-defense, was acquitted of all charges by a jury on Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the verdict, Martin has been viewed by some as a victim of racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants in the march held signs with slogans including &quot;Don't kill our kids&quot; and &quot;Do not buy Florida products.&quot; Mayor Josh Cohen and the three African-American City Council members - Alderman Ken Kirby, D-Ward 6; Alderwoman Classie Hoyle, D-Ward 3; and Alderwoman Sheila Finlayson, D-Ward 4 - were among those speaking at the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoyle said it saddens her to see that some things in race relations haven't changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She talked about her memories of the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American boy who was killed in Mississippi after supposedly flirting with a white woman in a store. He had gone there to buy candy. She remembers putting her head on her desk at school and crying when she heard the news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before Zimmerman shot Martin, the teen had gone to a store to buy Skittles and an iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here we are now, it's 2013, and we can't send our kids to the store for candy,&quot; Hoyle said. &quot;Will black people ever be first-class citizens?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arnold Smith, who owns a business called the Goodie Bus, said he was almost glad Zimmerman &quot;got off&quot; because the outrage and frustration seem to have mobilized the African-American community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Each one of you here is charged with changing yourselves,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers are planning another march for Saturday to join a national series of rallies in memory of Martin. No time or place has been set yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carl Snowden, an Annapolis civil rights activist, said a group of African-American leaders will ask House Speaker Michael E. Busch, D-Annapolis, to introduce state legislation next year to make it a crime for law enforcement in Maryland to profile individuals based on race. Snowden was not among those marching in the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, called the Caucus of African-American Leaders, is a local coalition of clergy, the Black Chamber of Commerce and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Anne Arundel County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowden said the caucus will make the request at a previously scheduled meeting with the delegate on Aug. 7. Its members would like to see a bill named the &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Anti-Racial Profiling Act,&quot; modeled after federal legislation U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., has sponsored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are some very strong feelings in the community that there was a miscarriage of justice,&quot; Snowden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many believe Martin's case could have happened in Maryland. Snowden talked about the case of Noah Jamahl Jones, an African-American teenager from Pasadena who died in a 2004 brawl involving white teens. No hate-crimes charges were ever filed, and the only defendant who went to trial, Jacob T. Fortney, was found not guilty of all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People believe there were racial overtones in the acquittal,&quot; Snowden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Busch could not be reached Tuesday for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sign up to vote</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Annapolis Democratic Action Committee, a self-described group of progressive Democrats, also is using the Zimmerman verdict to encourage people to vote. Kirby said he would be at the pool at The Harbour House public-housing neighborhood in Eastport to help sign people up to vote this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter registration forms will be available during the pool's operating hours from noon to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee sent out an email to members Monday, urging them to channel their anger toward positive change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict shows why you must never lose your voice to fight injustice and unfairness,&quot; the committee wrote. &quot;Yet there is no doubt that this year's city elections will be the most important in years and we will need your voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday evening's march was not the first rally on the Martin case to convene on Lawyers Mall off College Avenue. In March 2012, several state lawmakers wore hooded sweatshirts and held a press conference to draw awareness to the teenager's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finlayson urged people to sign the NAACP petition asking the Department of Justice to continue its investigation into the case and pursue civil rights charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saturday was a very bad day for the world,&quot; Finlayson said. &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death must not be in vain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us give the jury the benefit of the doubt. Let us assume that, within the narrow constraints of the evidence at hand and Florida's bizarre gun laws, six good women rendered the only verdict they could Saturday night in acquitting George Zimmerman of murder and manslaughter in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Even so, the problem remains. Whatever legal closure it gives, this verdict does not satisfy, any more than a guilty verdict would have, the central moral question here:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why did Zimmerman regard Trayvon as suspicious when all he did was wear a hooded sweatshirt while walking in the rain? Why did initial police reports designate Trayvon the suspect when he was actually the unarmed victim? Why was his assailant able to go home that same night?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents have consistently rejected any notion that race played a role in his death. It was a smart position, reflecting a recognition that when race enters the conversation, reason often exits, compassion following close behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But truth is, race has been there at every turn. If man and boy had both been black or white, we would never have heard of either. There likely would not even have been a shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many of us as African-Americans, that night was a recurring nightmare driven to a horrific conclusion. It was the driving-while-black traffic stops, the &quot;born suspect&quot; joke that isn't, the cost of being black in a nation that considers black the natural color of criminality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people - most of them white and on the furthest right of the political spectrum - will disagree. For them, Zimmerman is the victim here, a man who acted justifiably to defend himself. Race, they will say, did not enter the picture except afterward, when he was thrown to the mob because of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And you wonder: What color is the sky on their world?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years ago, &quot;What Would You Do?&quot; an ABC-TV hidden-camera show, set up a situation where two actors posed as bike thieves in a public park, using bolt cutters and hacksaws to cut a bike chain. The results were instructive. Over the course of an hour, a hundred people passed the white &quot;thief&quot; by with barely a glance. The black one had hardly gotten to work before a crowd of whites gathered around him, interrogating him, lecturing him, calling 911, even shooting cellphone video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did race explain the disparity? &quot;Not at all,&quot; a white man who had harassed the black actor assured the cameras. &quot;He could've been any color, it wouldn't have mattered to me.&quot; He doubtless believed what he said. For some of us, though, it has a tired, heard-before quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, after all, the kind of thing some people always say when you complain of voter ID laws that will peel black voters off the rolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or when you condemn Republican presidential candidates for using &quot;welfare&quot; as a dog-whistle word of racial acrimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or when an unarmed boy is killed and the man who did the killing doesn't even spend the night in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the answer to the moral questions that killing raises is not mysterious to some of us. We know how America is. We know, for instance, that it regards black men as inherently criminal, jails them disproportionately because of that belief, then points to the fact that they are disproportionately jailed as proof of that belief. We know, in other words, that where people who look like Trayvon are concerned, America is a little nuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we know what stalked Trayvon down that street last year. We know what killed him. And we know why the people who were paid to give a damn about that, didn't. You see, we have not the luxury of self-delusion. We have sons and grandsons and nephews, and we must teach them, too, how America is.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Does the not-guilty decision in Florida in the George Zimmerman case mean that any time two people get into a fistfight one of the assailants can pull his gun and shoot and kill his unarmed opponent and then claim self-defense because he can show a few bruises?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Elk are much, much bigger animals than deer. I am horrified at the idea that our state, without even informing our citizens, let these huge animals on our public lands. This is a travesty. Stop it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I wonder what impact it would have if all of the Trayvon Martin demonstrators were doing so because of the young-male black-on-black murders in most big cities. Their actions are sending mixed signals, the same thing they are complaining about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Joe Holland is, like all Republicans, trying to remove freedoms, not expand them. That's why they can't win a national election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Good grief, is Wade Linger's ego so fragile that he can't even step down as BOE president without having his buddy Steve Roberts write one last paean to his tenure? What exactly did he accomplish as president other than firing the former state superintendent and installing his pal in her place? What's different for kids? Nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-For many weeks, CNN, Headline News, MSNBC and Fox News have continuously bombarded us with the Zimmerman murder trial. Now that it's over, they are trying to stir up racial unrest over the verdict so they can continue to report &quot;breaking news&quot; and make a mockery of our justice system. Shame on these networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Venters should not be worried about President Obama, who is making our country economically sound, but be mad at CEOs and Republicans who want you to be paid below livable wages and stuff their pockets with fruits of your hard labor letting your family go hungry and without health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Brine from fracking put in wells polluting drinking water comes when the state is strapped for money. State leaders vote OK to allow it in the name of jobs. They should leave office and be convicted of poisoning. We pay cost of all cleanup while oil barons go free. Sissonville and Fayetteville areas will suffer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Would someone tell me what that C&amp;O commercial means? They just mention C&amp;O's name and then everyone just walks out of the restaurant. It's worse than Chris Miller's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Yesterday a campaign ad showed up on my Facebook page. The good news is there were 450 likes, which means positive. There were well over 1,000 negative comments. We might be singing bye-bye Joe in a couple years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The reason that a &quot;Federal case against Zimmerman seen as difficult&quot; is because, as with the bogus state charge, he's innocent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I don't know why this paper won't print anything about the handicapped and the elderly getting meals two or three days a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I don't know where the WV Style writers get their info, but 1955 is not retro and no one dressed like the models in the newspaper Sunday. It was the era of Ozzie and Harriet, June Cleaver, etc. Do you really think women wore minidresses? You're one decade too early!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I see where President Obama is not going to enforce his Obamacare on some employers now. Maybe he would like to forget the rest of it, including the more than $100 per month increase in insurance for the wife and I. So sick and tired of paying for others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Way to go, Kanawha County Board of Education. With your new rule about no out-of-district transfers, kids from overcrowded Overbrook Elementary are not allowed to transfer a couple of miles away to Kenna, which is underenrolled! Parents got their letters of refusal last week! Remember these things, voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The product of the &quot;entertainment&quot; industry today, across all its venues, can be described as little more than unadulterated garbage. Sadly, most of the under-50 crowd must think this is normal and that it's always been this way. Of the sick, by the sick, for the sick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Joe Manchin won his first couple elections because people thought they were voting for A. James Manchin. By the time they realized the difference it was too late. A new generation of uninformed voters cast votes for Joe because they recognized the name, not his record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-One driver can't enter the Interstate without traffic slowing down for them. Another can't exit because of foliage. We've become a society of nondrivers. Maybe these two drivers need to hang up their keys before they drive through the front of a building and blame it on a mechanical problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The wannabe lawyers screaming about their rights being violated at DUI and seatbelt checkpoints are forgetting something important: Driving isn't a God-given constitutional right. It's a privilege. A privilege can be taken away if you don't follow the rules.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO, Fla. - Four of the jurors in the George Zimmerman trial distanced themselves late Tuesday from statements that another juror made in a televised interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four jurors issued a brief statement on court stationary saying the opinions expressed by Juror B37 to CNN Monday night are not representative of their views. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The opinions of Juror B-37, expressed on the Anderson Cooper show were her own, and not in any way representative of the jurors listed below,&quot; said the statement, signed by Jurors B51, B76, E6 and E40.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 said the actions of Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch volunteer, and Trayvon Martin both led to the teenager's fatal shooting last year, but that Zimmerman didn't break any law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four other jurors said in their statement that Martin's death weighed on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Serving on this jury has been a highly emotional and physically draining experience for each of us,&quot; the statement said. &quot;The death of a teenager weighed heavily on our hearts but in the end we did what the law required us to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interview came two days after the jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of Martin in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. Martin was black, and Zimmerman is Hispanic. Zimmerman was not arrested for 44 days, and the delay in charging him led to protests from those who believed race was a factor in the handling of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the CNN interview, Juror B37 said she didn't believe Zimmerman followed Martin, 17, because of his race. She said Zimmerman made some mistakes but that she believed Martin struck Zimmerman first and that Zimmerman had a right to defend himself.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - The &quot;true genius of America,&quot; Barack Obama said the night America elected its first black president in 2008, is &quot;that American can change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uproar over the George Zimmerman verdict is a vivid, somber reminder of how that change comes slowly, even haltingly at times, and how much race still courses through American politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the days of legal segregation and institutional discrimination are now a generations-old memory, major policy disputes roiling Washington continue to have racial subtexts. The immigration fight is in one sense a fight for the loyalty of the growing, influential Latino voting bloc. The battle over how or whether to strengthen the recently diluted Voting Rights Act stirs fears that blacks in the South will lose long-cherished rights. Other clashes over the size, scope and cost of government continue to have racial undercurrents as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Different groups have different views of what government policy should be, and that doesn't seem to be going away at all,&quot; said Merle Black, a Southern politics expert at Emory University in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman verdict has the potential to harden racial attitudes that have been developing for generations. The Sanford, Fla., neighborhood watch volunteer was found not guilty Saturday in connection with the death of black teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History shows that once certain groups of voters learn to trust a political party, they don't switch allegiances. They remember perceptions of who worked against their interest, perhaps in opposing civil rights laws or denying funding to programs for lower-income people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black voters were intensely loyal to the Republican Party for roughly 70 years, remembering Abraham Lincoln's abolishing slavery and the party stalwarts who continued that legacy. Democrats were the party of the segregated South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The perception began to change during Franklin Roosevelt's presidency, as his New Deal helped ease the Depression's pain and first lady Eleanor Roosevelt became a champion of civil rights. When her husband ran for re-election in 1936, he got an estimated 71 percent of the black vote. Obama, the nation's first black president, got 93 percent of the black vote in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Latino community is still emerging as a political force. Though it has been trending more Democratic in recent years, Republicans still see opportunities. Polls suggest Latino voters will back Republicans who demonstrate sensitivity to immigration issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been a leader in the bipartisan effort to create a path to citizenship for the country's 11 million undocumented immigrants. He has endured withering conservative criticism for his stance and yet remains a prominent voice in his party and a potentially formidable 2016 presidential contender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly there's a subtext to this whole fight over immigration. Both parties have blatant political motives on this issue,&quot; said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll and author of &quot;Minority Party,&quot; a book about race in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Latino community is watching closely. An America's Voice/Latino Decisions poll of Hispanic voters last month found 53 percent named immigration as the nation's most important issue. Nearly two-thirds said they knew an undocumented immigrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also showed a willingness to vote for either party, as 48 percent said they had voted for a Republican in the past. As the undocumented immigrants become legal voters, most could very well side with either party, argued Adrian Pantoja, senior analyst at Latino Decisions, which studies Hispanic voting trends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Undocumented immigrants are still learning the positions and orientations of the political parties,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the more the Democratic Party promotes itself as the party of racial sensitivity, the more it hamstrings Republicans' efforts to diversify. Obama on Sunday issued a somber statement asking &quot;every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot; Sixteen months ago, Obama was more blunt. &quot;When I think about this boy I think about my own kids,&quot; he lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans this week have said little. Neither House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, nor Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has spoken publicly about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Party officials routinely deny any racial undercurrent to their thinking on immigration, voting rights or for that matter any other issue. The party earlier this year launched an aggressive effort to woo minority voters through grassroots organizing and other strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But long-held images persist, and there has been little Republican enthusiasm for revisiting last month's Supreme Court ruling on the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The court struck down a key provision requiring areas with histories of racial bias to get federal approval for changes in voting laws. The act is a touchstone for many blacks, who recall its pivotal role in securing the right to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans urge looking at a broader picture. Wooing minorities will not happen all at once, and a key way to engage them, said former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, is to stress the party's economic views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As increasing numbers of people grow tired of politics that divide people,&quot; he said, &quot;you try breaking down the barriers with a growing economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His party has had only limited success with that mantra. President George W. Bush got 44 percent of the Latino vote in 2004. The former Texas governor's record as sensitive to Latino concerns such as education and immigration helped, but so did the booming economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, though, minority voters still zero in on certain issues more than whites. A 2009 Pew study of black voter attitudes found 53 percent of blacks thought major conflict existed between blacks and whites, while only one-third of whites felt that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now comes the Zimmerman case, sparking a new dialogue about race in American life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's likely to continue for some time, said Black of Emory University, because &quot;in different ways, race and ethnicity still structures a lot of American politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Montreal, Maine &amp; Atlantic Railway train hurtled down a seven-mile incline, derailed and ignited in Lac-Megantic, near the Maine border. All but one of its 73 cars was carrying oil, and at least five exploded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harding had left the train unattended overnight to sleep at a local inn shortly before it barreled into town. Thirty-eight bodies have been recovered, and authorities continue to look for 12 bodies amid intense heat and hazardous conditions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal over the weekend in the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin has touched off protests around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton announced the plan Tuesday at a news conference outside the Justice Department with several ministers. He did not say which cities are involved, but did say the rallies and vigils will be staged Saturday at federal buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department is investigating whether Zimmerman violated Martin's civil rights when he shot the 17-year-old during a February 2012 confrontation in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman said he fired his gun in self-defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Cecil Smith took over as police chief in Sanford, Fla., he relied on what he'd learned during his 25 years in Elgin to deal with the potentially explosive aftermath of the death of teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In about three months in Florida, Smith has been all but consumed by anticipated fallout from the trial of Martin's shooter, George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith, who ended his career in Elgin as deputy chief, took over April 1 as chief in Sanford. Zimmerman, who shot and killed Martin in February 2012, was found not guilty of murder and manslaughter charges by a jury Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite fears of rioting, Sanford so far has remained quiet with only a handful of peaceful protests, the largest one numbering about 150 people outside the courthouse when the verdict was announced, Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police department essentially doubled the number of patrol officers by implementing a tighter rotation system when the Zimmerman jury began deliberating and will keep that in place at least through Thursday, after the NAACP annual convention wraps up in Orlando, Fla., Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It hasn't been easy to deal with an issue in the national spotlight while trying to get his bearings in the new job, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Probably the tough part has been that you want to come in and meet all your people and really get to know them,&quot; he said. &quot;I've put a lot of stuff on hold. I focused the past three months on focusing that the community was safe and the community was talking to each other. Thus far, it has essentially paid off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith said he took Elgin's community policing model to Sanford, where residents of the town of about 55,000 rarely saw or heard from previous police chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was strange coming from Elgin -- the things we were doing there, with the chief being out in the community and being active in the community, it was different here,&quot; he said. &quot;The (Sanford) chief was a guy they'd occasionally see when something major happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and his officers have done a lot of door-to-door community policing to introduce themselves to residents, talk to them about their concerns and encourage them to reach out to police -- even giving out work cellphone numbers, a common practice in Elgin, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That hadn't been done here before. Most people didn't know how to get a hold of the chief,&quot; he said. &quot;They are surprised when I show up for stuff. I went to the protests on Sunday and just talked to people. The reaction has been very good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To prepare for the Zimmerman verdict, Smith met with local groups, including local branches of the NAACP and Urban league, and the Sanford Pastors Connection, a new group comprising about 70 pastors from Seminole County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He worked closely with the Seminole County sheriff and consulted with the Orlando police chief, whose officers broke up a riot during a new Nike shoe launch last year, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also reached out to Lakeland, Fla., Police Chief Lisa Womack, who was chief in Elgin until 2010, and the North Port, Fla., police chief, who was Smith's roommate at the FBI National Academy, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been a great relationship with all the folks down here,&quot; Smith said. &quot;They all offered to send as many people as we'd need (in case of riots), but it hasn't been necessary. In Sanford, thus far, we've been blessed with quietness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case may not be over, because Zimmerman might face a lawsuit or, less likely, federal civil rights charges, many have speculated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Smith said he wants to get to work on things like revamping the Sanford police's community relations section, addressing pending departmental promotions and implementing something similar to Elgin's citizens police academy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also wants to have an active role in addressing other areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do we get development into some of the impoverished areas? How do we improve the infrastructures that are in place? It's also about looking at jobs and employment,&quot; he said. &quot;There's a lot of things that need to be done, a lot of conversation that needs to be had. But we're definitely steps ahead of where the city was 17 or 18 months ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD -- Ramadan this year is shaping up to be the deadliest in Iraq since a bloody insurgency and rampant sectarian killings pushed the country to the edge of civil war in 2007. Suicide attacks, car bombings and other violence have killed at least 169 Iraqis just seven days into the Islamic holy month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel condemns EU move: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JERUSALEM -- Israeli leaders Tuesday condemned an EU ban on funding to Israeli institutions that operate in occupied territories, but also acknowledged the country's growing isolation over its construction of settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The EU decision marked a new show of displeasure with Israeli settlements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italian minister denies role:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROME -- Interior Minister Angelino Alfano, Silvio Berlusconi's top political aide, resisted growing calls Tuesday to step down as interior minister over the botched deportation of the wife and 6-year-old daughter of a Kazakh dissident, a flap which has ratcheted up tensions in Italy's fragile coalition government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaker seeks to stay in Russia:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW -- National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden on Tuesday submitted a request for temporary asylum in Russia, his lawyer said, claiming he faces persecution from the U.S. government and could face torture or death. Russia is required by law to consider the application within three months, but could do it faster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water fills astronauts' helmet:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- In one of the most harrowing spacewalks in years, an astronaut had to rush back into the International Space Station on Tuesday after a mysterious water leak inside his helmet robbed him of the ability to speak or hear and could have caused him to choke. Italian Luca Parmitano seemed fine after the dangerous episode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama urges calm after trial:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- When President Barack Obama first addressed the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last year, he did so passionately, declaring that if he had a son, he would look like the slain 17-year-old. His powerful and personal commentary marked a rare public reflection on race from the nation's first black president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arias trial may be September:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHOENIX -- A new jury could be impaneled to decide whether Jodi Arias should be sentenced to death or life in prison sometime in late September, a judge said Tuesday. Arias was convicted of first-degree murder May 8 in the stabbing and shooting death of boyfriend Travis Alexander in his suburban Phoenix home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum requests increasing:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Requests for asylum in the United States have nearly quadrupled in the last five years, mostly due to claims by immigrants coming from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, according to internal figures from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement obtained by The Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate steps back from brink:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Senate stepped away from the brink of a meltdown Tuesday, clearing the way for confirmation of several of President Barack Obama's nominees long blocked by Republicans, agreeing to quick action on unnamed others and finessing a Democratic threat to overturn historic rules that protect minority-party rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton leads Martin rallies:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Rev. Al Sharpton said Tuesday he will lead a national &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; day in 100 cities this weekend to press for federal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman. He was acquittal over the weekend in the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, touching off protests around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio board rejects clemency:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A condemned Cleveland killer moved one step closer to execution Tuesday despite a rare plea for mercy from the prosecutor overseeing his case. The Ohio Parole Board voted 6-4 to turn down a request for clemency for death row inmate Billy Slagle, sentenced to die for stabbing a neighbor 17 times almost 30 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markey the newest senator:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Massachusetts Democrat Edward Markey on Tuesday became the newest member of the Senate, taking the oath of office after serving 37 years on the other side of the Capitol in the House. Markey, 67, takes the seat that John Kerry won in 1984 and held until he resigned earlier this year to become U.S. secretary of State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't like what George Zimmerman did and I hate that Trayvon Martin is dead. But I also can understand why Zimmerman was suspicious and why he thought Martin was wearing a uniform we all recognize. I don't know if Zimmerman is a racist. Yet I'm tired of politicians and others who have donned hoodies in solidarity with Martin and who essentially suggest that I am a racist for recognizing the reality of urban crime in America. The hoodie blinds them as much as it did Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those who quickly donned a hoodie was Christine Quinn, the speaker of the New York City Council. Quinn was hardly a lonesome panderer. Lesser politicians joined her and, like her, pronounced Zimmerman a criminal. &quot;What George Zimmerman did was wrong, was a crime,&quot; Quinn said before knowing all of the facts and before the jury unaccountably found otherwise. She was half right. What Zimmerman did was wrong. It was not, by verdict of his peers, a crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where is the politician who will own up to the painful complexity of the problem and acknowledge the widespread fear of crime committed by young black males? This does not mean that raw racism has disappeared and some judgments are not the product of invidious stereotyping. It does mean, though, that the public knows that young black males commit a disproportionate amount of crime. In New York City, blacks comprise 23.4 percent of the population yet they represent 78 percent of all shooting suspects -- almost all of them young men. We know them from the nightly news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those statistics represent the justification for New York City's controversial stop-and-frisk program, which amounts to racial profiling writ large. After all, if young black males are your shooters then it ought to be young black males that the cops stop and frisk. Still, common sense and common decency -- not to mention the law -- insist on other variables such as suspicious behavior, but race is a factor, without a doubt. It would be senseless for the cops to be stopping Danish tourists in Times Square just to make the statistics look good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish I had a solution to this problem. If I were a young black male and was stopped just on account of my appearance, I would feel violated. If the cops are abusing their authority and using race as the only reason, that has got to stop. But if they ignore race, then they are fools and ought to go into another line of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The least we can do is talk honestly about the problem. It does no one any good to merely cite the number of stops and frisks made on black males and not cite the murder statistics as well. Citing the former and not the latter is an Orwellian exercise in political correctness. It not only censors half of the story but suggests that racism is the sole reason for the policy. This mindlessness, like racism itself, is repugnant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one time, I thought Barack Obama would bring the problem into the open and remove the racist stigma. Instead, he perpetuated it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his acclaimed Philadelphia speech on race, he cited his grandmother as &quot;a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her by on the street.&quot; How about the former Barry Obama? When he was a Columbia University student living on the lip of then-dangerous Harlem, did he never have the same fear?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no doubt in my mind that Zimmerman profiled Martin and, braced by a gun, set off in quest of heroism. The result was a quintessentially American tragedy -- the death of a young man understandably suspected because he was black and tragically dead for the same reason.</SPAN></P>

Such laws need challenging as they reverse history's path away from killing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It didn't take long. Three days after a jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in the murder of Trayvon Martin, the Justice Department said it will take a &quot;hard look&quot; at a new type of self-defense law known as &quot;stand your ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida and nearly two dozen other states have passed such laws since 2005 in a campaign led by the National Rifle Association. The laws get rid of an old legal doctrine that anyone confronted by a dangerous person has a &quot;duty to retreat&quot; rather than shoot. And the laws provide greater legal leniency toward killers who claim they acted out of fear of harm or death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's one reason Florida officials hesitated in arresting Mr. Zimmerman. He wasn't charged for 44 days after the shooting. And even though his legal defense relied on a traditional self-defense argument rather than Florida's Stand Your Ground law, the judge's instructions to the jury specifically mentioned the law's provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it is doubtful a Justice Department probe can make a legal challenge against the state laws, the federal scrutiny is needed. Homicide rates have risen 7 to 9 percent in states with stand-your-ground laws compared with other states, according to a 2012 Texas A&amp;M study. And findings by Georgia State University &quot;raise serious doubts against the argument that Stand Your Ground laws make [the] public safer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laws &quot;senselessly expand the concept of self-defense,&quot; Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday. They &quot;try to fix something that was never broken&quot; and have &quot;victimized too many who are innocent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the Justice probe, the US Commission on Civil Rights began an investigation last May to see if stand-your-ground laws encourage racial killings. A study published by the Urban Institute found more homicides were likely to be deemed justified in states with stand-your-ground laws than in other states, while shootings of blacks by whites &quot;were likely to go unpunished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the main reason to challenge these laws is that they reverse the course of history. The rise of civilization has relied in large part on humans handing over the control and use of violence for protection and defense to the government. Societies built on moral codes that tell individuals &quot;thou shall not kill&quot; have proved to be more long-lasting. At a deeper level, they reflect an expanding respect for life, not just for family or nation, but for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stand-your-ground laws give too much authority back to individuals to decide the places or circumstances in which they can use violence. Many people have only a vague understanding of the laws' legal distinctions or are able to assess the probability of harm being done to them. Other people may purposely kill off a harmless opponent, claiming a threat was imminent and with little risk of being charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you make it easier for people to use deadly force, you get more of it,&quot; said Mark Hoekstra, an associate professor of economics at Texas A&amp;M University and the lead author of the 2012 study, which found these laws cause an additional 500 to 700 homicides each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The popularity of the laws reflects growing distrust or lack of faith in government. &quot;Lynchings, riots, civil disobedience and vigilantism are all expressions of individual or collective action that reject both legal norms and the authority of state actors,&quot; writes Columbia University law professor Jeffrey Fagan. If that is the case, then America's political system needs urgent repair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laws that make it easier to shoot first and ask questions later are not a hallmark of human progress. At a practical level, they seem to increase homicides, not stem them. For that reason alone, states with the laws have a duty to retreat.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISTANBUL (CIHAN)- Sometimes societies are ready to change fundamentally; they just wait for a spark. <BR>The spark may be the death of a man. Symbolic deaths, such as the death of Jesus Christ, make people realize that the existing socio-political order no longer satisfies their demands. Thus, people who were unable to express their grievances until then and who notice that the current system is unfair take to the streets. Turkish history is full of events like this, and the funeral of murdered Armenian journalist Hrant Dink is a perfect example of this phenomenon. We also remember Mohamed Bouazizi, the young Tunisian street vendor who set himself alight, starting a fire that burned down several authoritarian regimes in the Middle East.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The history of the United States is also full of similar dramatic events. The 1960s were particularly rich in this regard, and the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Robert Kennedy changed the country fundamentally. Last year, a 17-year-old American, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, was killed by George Zimmerman. The problem is that the killer is white, while the victim was black. The jury found Zimmerman not guilty by reason of self-defense and believed him when he said he is terribly sorry and that he had had good intentions but events just went terribly wrong. <BR><BR>As expected, the verdict has made many people angry. Even US President Barack Obama, who is the first black president in American history, said he understands the nation's frustration but that the US is a nation of law and a jury has spoken. It would seem that seeing &quot;one of them&quot; in the White House has not been enough for black Americans to feel they are now equal citizens. Obama's election did not eradicate all discrimination in the United States. Instead, maybe his presence in office has made ongoing discrimination less visible to society. <BR><BR>People suffer discrimination all around the world because of their color, religion, race or sexual orientation. A woman can become prime minister or a homosexual the mayor of the country's capital, but these things do not mean all that all discrimination has suddenly stopped. <BR><BR>The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case has shown that the tension between whites and blacks is still strong in the US. Additionally, the entire world has learned that someone can kill another man in the US and be found not guilty just because he was a neighborhood watch coordinator. It seems that Zimmerman's only concern was to &quot;protect&quot; his white neighbors. The world is full of people like him. For example, last week, some &quot;volunteers&quot; armed with knives and sticks attacked Gezi protesters in Istanbul, but a court decided to release one of them. He then flew to Morocco. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is the perceived gap between law and justice. The existing laws that judges must follow do not always bring justice. The judiciary does not think about what the social consequences of its verdicts might be, either. That is why society sometimes believes the judiciary itself is the very source of injustice. <BR><BR>Black people in the US are now demonstrating in the streets, and Obama's political opponents will certainly use this against him. They will probably say that President Obama, who became president thanks to the votes of black people, is not serving them. This is already Obama's second term, so he cannot run again for office. The Democrats would, of course, like to keep the White House for another four years; however, Obama's mistakes are not helping them. As a consequence, the Republicans, and the Tea Party, are becoming stronger. A Tea Party-ruled US, however, would mean an aggressive country, and this would be bad news for all of us. <BR><BR>The members of the jury in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case were most probably unaware of global realities, but sometimes a single man dies and the world changes. <BR><BR>BERIL DEDEOGLU (Cihan/Today's Zaman) CIHAN</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BERKELEY -- The city was once a leader in the civil rights struggle, Mansour Id-Deen, president of the Berkeley NAACP, told a standing room-only-crowd at an afternoon meeting July 13 at the South Berkeley library.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, today we have some very serious issues that this city has to deal with,&quot; he said, contending that Berkeley has issues of discrimination in housing, employment, education, health care and policing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, called by the Berkeley NAACP and partner organizations, was attended by around 100 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Id-Deen talked about racial profiling in Berkeley. Two days earlier, he was driving in South Berkeley behind an unmarked drug task force car and watched as officers turned their lights on and stopped near a young black man waiting at a bus stop. Id-Deen stopped to observe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Three officers got out of the car,&quot; he said. &quot;They approached the young man and he's looking at them, like, 'What's going on?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Id-Deen said it brings to mind the killing of Oscar Grant and Trayvon Martin. &quot;You have officers walking toward you -- you don't know what they want,&quot; he said. &quot;You haven't done anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers asked the young man for identification and where he was going. &quot;He politely refused to give it to them and said he was waiting for the bus,&quot; Id-Deen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers said they'd wait with him. At that point the young man walked away, Id-Deen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not easy to prove racial bias in police stops, Maria Moore, sister of Kayla Xavier Moore who died in police custody in February, told the audience. She said police don't keep records on the race of people they stop but don't cite; she asked the audience to demand that they do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">School board member Josh Daniels addressed the gap in academic proficiency between African Americans and whites, a gap that increases between kindergarten and graduation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">School district data shows, for example, that on standardized tests in language arts, just 23 percent of African Americans were proficient, while 84 percent of whites were proficient. Daniels said that schools are addressing the problem and the gap is narrowing, but it won't close by the district's target date of 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paula Phillips, president of the Berkeley Council of Classified Employees pointed to the dearth of black teachers in Berkeley. Daniels said the district hires African Americans, but they leave at higher rates than other teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City government came under fire with allegations of discriminatory hiring, firing and promotional practices. Speakers said the NAACP asked the city to hire an independent firm to assess the situation, but the city has yet to agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This year is the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's march on D.C. about jobs and justice and freedom,&quot; said Gladys Gray, president of the city's maintenance workers division of SEIU 1021. &quot;We need to understand what that was about 50 years ago and where we are today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Manager Christine Daniel was present for the four-hour meeting, as was Police Capt. Cynthia Harris. Daniel told this newspaper she was not prepared to comment on questions raised about city employment practices, other than to say the city continues to meet with SEIU on labor issues. Harris said she would be able to comment later, after gathering information about the police stop Id-Deen referenced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilman Jesse Arreguin blamed Berkeley's diminishing African American population -- about 19 percent in 1960 and 10 percent today -- on the lack of affordable housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're losing families, low income people, working people,&quot; Arreguin said. &quot;Rent continues to increase. It's almost virtually impossible if you're a working class person to buy a single-family home in Berkeley. Unless we stand up and fight for affordable housing, and we fight to protect our diversity, what we love about our community may be gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Census figures from 2009 show that 23 percent of African Americans in Berkeley (2,700 people) lived under the poverty line. For whites the rate was 14 percent or 8,000 people, while 20 percent of Hispanics (2,300) in Berkeley live below the poverty line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Vicki Alexander, who worked in the city's health department for more than a dozen years, addressed the high rate of low birth-weight babies among Berkeley's black population, arguing that health issues and education levels are only part of the problem. She placed much of the blame squarely &quot;on stress related to racism, stress walking down the street as a black person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander concluded that &quot;At a certain point, the struggle (for health care) has to join ... the housing struggle, the labor struggle -- all the other struggles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A follow-up meeting is planned for December.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the great disappointment of right-wing fear mongers everywhere, the African-American community did not explode in violence after the George Zimmerman verdict was announced Saturday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such forbearance speaks volumes about their dignity and patriotism. But how long must a people endure outrage after outrage before they finally give up? Is the answer still blowing in the wind?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most telling quote came from Trayvon Martin's aunt, who was asked by a reporter if she still believes in the fairness of the American justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She thought for a while and finally replied, &quot;No comment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My heart sank when I heard that because she's right. It's now clear, if it wasn't already, that it's open season on young black men. And what's more, it always has been. Look at the recent record:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2009: Oscar Grant, 23, is shot in the back in Oakland while lying face down, arms tied behind his back, by a BART policeman who serves only 11 months for the crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2012: Ramarley Graham, 18, shot and killed in the bathroom of his grandmother's home in New York City while attempting to flush a bag of marijuana down the toilet. He had no weapon, and police did not have a warrant to enter the house. A grand jury charges the officer with manslaughter, but a judge throws out the indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2012: Unarmed college student Kendrick McDade, 19, shot by Pasadena police officers and left on the street for a prolonged period without receiving first aid. His last words are &quot;Why did they shoot me?&quot; The officers are initially placed on paid administrative leave but later returned to duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2013: Unarmed Kimani Gray, 16, is shot four times in the front and side of his body and three times in the back by New York City police officers as he leaves a friend's birthday party. The officers are never charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now this latest miscarriage of justice, which seems to stand for the proposition that an armed citizen is free to stalk other citizens, as long as the stalker is white and the victim is black. If their roles had been reversed, do you think the result would have been the same?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would the police have failed to investigate? Would the prosecutors have failed to aggressively prosecute the case? For that matter, would Zimmerman have been racially profiled in the first place?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a lot of blame to go around:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the police, who gave Zimmerman a pass;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the prosecutors, who never challenged the defense's narrative that Zimmerman was the real victim;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the right-wing blogs, who demonized the victim and raised almost $500,000 so Zimmerman could have the best &quot;expert&quot; witnesses money could buy;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the NRA, which puts guns in the hands of vigilantes and then passes &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws that make it as easy as possible for them to get away with murder;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">our craven and cowardly politicians, who lack the backbone to resist these pressures; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hollywood, which reinforces white paranoia by casting people of color over and over as the villains in crime shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Jefferson was no friend of African Americans, but at least he was smart enough to realize that the racial situation in this country is wrong. He wrote, &quot;I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With most of the protests and violence in the aftermath of the George Zimmerman verdict now giving way to dialogue, every high-profile athlete with a heart and soul faces an elemental question:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What should I say and do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some will continue to sigh in exasperation, shake their heads and go back to their very comfortable lives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few will speak out, knowing that many believe they are ill-equipped to take a public stand or get behind a cause, that their role in our society is to shut up and play. This, of course, disregards our history. No social movement in 20th century America -- whether race, gender, religion, age or sexuality -- has advanced without the energy and efforts of prominent athletic figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What would our nation look like without the contributions of Jackie Robinson and Branch Rickey, without Bill Russell and Red Auerbach? Could we have evolved as far as we have without the diligence and principles and voices of Muhammad Ali and Al Davis and Billie Jean King and Arthur Ashe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athlete-activists of yore risked getting stung by public backlash. Yet they often stood out front, even taking the lead in addressing inequality. They are symbols of progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two generations later, athletes tend to back away from hot-button issues. Each of the five active athletes with whom I've discussed this matter in recent days requested their comments -- and there were many -- be &quot;off the record&quot; or unattributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each also implied there will come a time when they will speak out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who in the world of sports will it be, and when?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One rationale for the reticence -- that we've moved beyond the civil rights battles of the 1960s and '70s -- would seem to be contradicted by the acquittal of Zimmerman in the profiling and shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another popular narrative in the 21st century is that athletes of color are quieter because they share in wealth once denied. They are commodities, multimillionaire corporations behind gated communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the raw emotion of recent days lurching toward constructive dialogue, shouldn't there be a vocal stirring within the sports community? We could use passionate and unified appeals for justice, someone willing to address delicate issues with the wisdom and eloquence required to reach ears in an age where many are too self-involved to listen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This touches them, too. Martin was in a gated community, the kind in which many sports figures live. As Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade asked via Twitter: &quot;How do I explain this to my young boys?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the immediate aftermath of the Zimmerman trial, many athletes posted their outrage on Twitter. NFL receivers Roddy White (Atlanta) and Victor Cruz (New York Giants) posted incendiary tweets for which they later apologized. Cincinnati's James Harrison posed a scenario in which he'd pick a fight, lose, draw a concealed weapon, kill his opponent and see if he, too, will be acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's outrage, and it's understood by any open mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Middleweight boxer Terrell Gausha, who draped himself in the flag during the 2012 Olympics in London, was so upset with the verdict, so disappointed with the American justice system, that he vows never again to wear the colors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can I wear my stars and stripes proudly in a country where they make a big deal out of Michael Vick fighting dogs,&quot; he told TMZ, &quot;but not a young, innocent black male's life?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's action. It's extreme, it's polarizing and it's risky. But the truly objective individual can, on some level, feel his pain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's needed is leadership. Many, if not most, locker rooms and clubhouses have a leader, a D-Wade or a Torii Hunter -- someone capable of assembling and arousing a group for a cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it too much to ask that the cause be bigger than a game?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem is that most players today -- black and white -- expressing themselves on any matter with racial undertones has to be very careful about how they say it,&quot; said Dave Stewart, the retired A's pitcher who now serves as a player agent. &quot;Some of them don't say anything. There are unwritten rules about what you should and shouldn't say, and everybody's aware of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guys who do speak up tend to be the older guys who are toward the end of their careers. They're secure financially and professionally, not worried about where their next paycheck might come from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recently attended a dinner ceremony at which the keynote speaker was NBA Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas. He was obtaining his master's degree at Cal and took a few moments to lament the lack of activism, particularly among athletes of color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He referenced the &quot;radicals&quot; of yesteryear and made indirect acknowledgment of individuals who stood up and made a difference. It was an impassioned plea for young athletes of color to become educated and aware, to embrace sociopolitical conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was necessary in 1963. Now, 50 years and many laws later, it's still needed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">617 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've seen this movie before. Sadly, there is no happy ending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have another racially charged incident that led to a racially charged trial resulting with yet another controversial verdict that satisfies some but infuriates others. We have threats of violence, civil unrest and a divided America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tragically, at moments like these, what Americans don't have much of is moral leadership -- the kind that can teach people how to cope with anger and disappointment over what they perceive to be an unjust outcome. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It sounds as though George Zimmerman and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin both made mistakes in their deadly confrontation on Feb. 26, 2012. Zimmerman shouldn't have been carrying a gun, and itching to play wannabe cop by pursuing a stranger after a 911 dispatcher told him not to. His supporters say Martin shouldn't have been so aggressive, pummeling the neighborhood watch volunteer while he was on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, in the nearly 17 months since that night, many commentators haven't conducted themselves much better. Just a few weeks after the shooting, President Barack Obama made the provocative comment: &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; The president seemed to be improperly injecting himself into a local investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the more reason that Obama deserves praise for what he said after Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder charges. Less than 24 hours after the verdict, the president issued a statement acknowledging that the case had &quot;elicited strong passions&quot; but also stressed that &quot;we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot; Obama has taken heat from some African-Americans for saying that. But this is the right message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president also urged restraint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son,&quot; Obama said. &quot;And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department must not have received the memo. In a statement of its own, it signaled that this heartbreaking drama might not be over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that Zimmerman has been acquitted in state court, federal prosecutors are looking into whether they should file criminal civil rights charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Filing charges would be a mistake. Unless those federal prosecutors are certain that they could prove that Zimmerman singled out Martin because of his race and violated his civil rights, this whole thing could be headed for another acquittal. Besides, prosecutors are supposed to look only at facts and the law, and not worry about placating angry mobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president is right: A jury has spoken. In our legal system, prosecutors don't get to retry a defendant over and over again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, outside the courtroom, there is a powder keg. There have been protests in a number of cities, including Oakland and Los Angeles, where hundreds of demonstrators gathered to show their anger. Many smashed windows and sprayed graffiti on private businesses. A few of them even burned the American flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, it's not helpful to have the usual grievance merchants stirring the pot. The Rev. Al Sharpton called the verdict &quot;an atrocity.&quot; PBS host Tavis Smiley said the verdict was evidence of the &quot;incontrovertible contempt that this nation often shows and displays for black men.&quot; The Rev. Jesse Jackson declared Martin a &quot;martyr,&quot; comparing him to Emmett Till and Medgar Evers. Till and Evers were killed by white supremacists. Is that what Jackson thinks George Zimmerman is?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama wants Americans to &quot;widen the circle of compassion and understanding.&quot; but the circle seems to be getting smaller and smaller.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CORRECTION (Published 7/19/2013)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">A story about two protesters charged with crimes at a Monday night demonstration in Oakland incorrectly reported the crime each protester is accused of committing. Jeffrey Clark is accused of two misdemeanors; Lamar Caldwell is accused of a felony. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- The Alameda County District Attorney's Office filed criminal charges Wednesday against three protesters who contributed to a chaotic and violent march Monday night, while Oakland police announced the arrest of another protester on an outstanding warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamar Caldwell, 26, and Tanzeen Dohal, 34, of San Jose, were arrested and charged with felony vandalism, according to authorities. Jeffrey Clark, 30, who holds a New York driver's license but listed his address in Oakland, was charged with misdemeanor battery on a police officer and assault, police said. The men were arrested Monday night near the 1500 block of Broadway. A police probable cause warrant states that Clark threw a rock at a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caldwell, also of Oakland, is accused of causing more than $400 in damage for breaking a display window at the Men's Warehouse store on Broadway. A police probable cause warrant states that officers watched Caldwell striking the window at least three times with an &quot;unknown object&quot; until it broke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Oakland police announced that another man was arrested late Tuesday after a fourth night of protesting along downtown Oakland streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest, which took place near 14th Street and Broadway, came on the heels of three consecutive nights of vandalism and violence that left smashed windows and storefronts, graffiti and debris from demonstrators' clashes with police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evening marked the first night since Saturday that protesters did not march or vandals did not damage city streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protester was arrested on an outstanding warrant during a confrontation between police and more than 30 protesters after the Oakland City Council meeting, police said. Seventeen others were cited with various misdemeanor offenses, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police also reportedly confiscated sound equipment from a protester who allegedly violated the city's noise ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd was protesting Saturday's acquittal of George Zimmerman in Florida in the shooting death of an African American youth, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, and on Monday night briefly shut down traffic on Interstate 880 and blocked several streets. During the protesters' marches and skirmishes with police downtown, more than a dozen businesses were vandalized, including some targeted during previous protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the targeted businesses on Monday were Comerica Bank, 1200 Broadway, the Burger King restaurant at 13th and Broadway; Youth Radio, 1701 Broadway; and Men's Warehouse, 300 Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. All had windows smashed. Sears, 1950 Broadway, had more windows smashed and paint was splattered, and the restaurant Flora, 1900 Telegraph Ave., where a waiter was savagely attacked with a hammer, had its windows broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no repeat of vandalism Tuesday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AL SHARPTON has a new, decades-younger, attractive main squeeze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil rights activist and MSNBC star, 58, is dating 35-year-old Aisha McShaw, a Westchester &quot;personal stylist&quot; who has been seen on Sharpton's arm at several recent black-tie affairs, including the White House Correspondents Dinner in April and President Obama's holiday party in December. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she arrived in a form-fitting black and white dress with a sharp-suited Sharpton at the New York County Democratic Committee Award Ceremony on Monday night, the Daily News asked her to define her relationship with the civil rights powerhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm his girlfriend,&quot; McShaw said before Sharpton intervened to shepherd her away from a reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told The News that she works as a &quot;personal stylist,&quot; but Sharpton quickly shuffled her off without letting her elaborate on her profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He refused to answer a question about how long the two had been an item.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton's relationship with McShaw appears to be the most serious one he's had since separating from his wife Kathy in 2004 after 24 years of marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, Sharpton's publicist said the two - who met when Kathy was working as a backup singer for James Brown - had simply grown apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton has been spending a lot of time with McShaw. The two have been photographed at elegant bashes all over the country for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young stylist, who is registered to vote as independent in Mamaroneck, says on her LinkedIn page that she works in financial services as a personal banker at Wells Fargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Sharpton was tight-lipped about his personal life Monday, the normally press-loving rabble-rouser was happy to pontificate with reporters on the city's political races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eliot Spitzer and Scott Stringer - Democratic rivals in the high-profile race for city controller - had both recently reached out to him, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have not made an endorsement there. . . . Both of them have called me and I told both of them that I was in the middle of the Trayvon Martin thing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOUR JURORS in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case distanced themselves Tuesday night from a fellow panelist who showed sympathy for George Zimmerman in a TV interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just moments after CNN aired part two of its interview with the juror known as B37, four of her fellow members on the six-woman jury issued a statement saying, &quot;The opinions of Juror B37, expressed on the Anderson Cooper show, were her own, and not in any way representative of the jurors listed below.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four jurors - who signed themselves jurors B51, B76, E6 and E40 - said serving on the jury had been &quot;a highly emotional and physically draining experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The death of a teenager weighed heavily on our hearts, but in the end we did what the law required us to do,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interview aired Tuesday night, juror B37 said Trayvon &quot;played a huge role in his death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anonymous juror said she believes Zimmerman was &quot;justified in shooting&quot; the 17-year-old high school student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think race had anything to do with this trial,&quot; she told Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean just because he was black and George was Spanish or Puerto Rican, I don't think it had anything to do with this trial,&quot; she said in a reference to Zimmerman, who is half-Peruvian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury's post-trial conflict played out as U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said he is gunning for &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's top lawman said during a speech at an NAACP convention in Orlando that the law - which featured prominently during Zimmerman's trial - should be reexamined and reformed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time to question laws that so dangerously expand self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods,&quot; Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not comment on the Justice Department's ongoing investigation into whether Zimmerman's shooting of Trayvon, an unarmed black teen, was motivated by racial bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1 million people have signed online petitions calling on the Justice Department to file a civil rights lawsuit against Zimerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Juror B37 said Zimmerman is only guilty of &quot;not using his senses&quot; when he confronted Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think he profiled him as a racial thing,&quot; the juror said. &quot;I think he profiled him just as someone in the neighborhood who was suspicious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile a tell-all book by Juror B37 is off the table following an outcry that she was trying to profit from the trial and its controversial conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that I am returned to my family and to society in general, I have realized that the best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book and return instead to my life as it was before I was called to sit on this jury,&quot; the juror said in a statement Tuesday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. ATTORNEY General Eric Holder is gunning for &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's top lawman said during a speech at an NAACP convention in Orlando that the law - which featured prominently during the murder trial of George Zimmerman - should be reexamined and reformed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time to question laws that so dangerously expand self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods,&quot; Holder said, just miles from the Sanford, Fla., courtroom where Zimmerman, 29, stood trial in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stand Your Ground laws give the benefit of the doubt to the gunman if he can prove he fired because he feared for his life. The law, which exists in some form in more than 20 states, does not require that a person retreat if possible - a concept Holder said is critical in legal concepts of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By allowing - and perhaps encouraging - violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety,&quot; Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not comment on the Justice Department's ongoing investigation into whether Zimmerman's shooting of Trayvon, an unarmed black teen, was motivated by racial bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton has been one of many civil rights leaders urging Holder to bring civil rights charges against Zimmerman, who was acquitted Saturday of murdering Trayvon, 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton announced Tuesday he is organizing 100 rallies in cities around the country to press the Justice Department to bring the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton did not say which cities are involved in the protests planned for this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile a tell-all book by Juror B37 - one of six unnamed women who acquitted Zimmerman - is off the table following an outcry that she was trying to profit from the trial and its controversial conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anonymous juror had announced Monday through a literary agent that she hoped to write the book that would give a behind-the-scenes look at the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan was scuttled after the juror gave an interview to CNN's Anderson Cooper in which she sympathized with Zimmerman, saying his &quot;heart was in the right place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that I am returned to my family and to society in general, I have realized that the best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book and return instead to my life as it was before I was called to sit on this jury,&quot; the juror said in a statement Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, authorities remained on guard for further rowdy protests after about 150 people split off from a demonstration Monday night and ran through the streets, committing vandalism and assaults and stopping traffic. Fourteen people were arrested.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Military religious freedoms under attack, groups say&quot; (News, July 10) mentions the Military Religious Freedom Foundation but fails to mention why this group exists in the first place. MRFF exists because reports from various military installations across the country show that some commanders have been using their religious beliefs as an excuse to harass lower-ranking members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In May 2010, soldiers attending training at Fort Eustice in Virginia reported being confined to their quarters for opting out of attending a concert by the Christian band BarlowGirl organized by the base command structure. Mandatory &quot;Spiritual Fitness Assessments&quot; are commonly used to evaluate leadership and command skills, with required remediation for service members who are deemed &quot;not spiritual enough.&quot; Some soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder were referred to chaplains for counseling (rather than to mental health professionals), where they're commonly told their mental health problems are a result of their lack of faith. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are not just a handful of disgruntled disbelievers trying to stir up trouble. The MRFF estimates 90 percent of the reports they get are from Christians seeking relief from evangelical or fundamentalist Christians. Aggressive proselytization hinders  unit cohesion, mission readiness and discipline. These regulations are in place to protect service members, not persecute them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I applaud the Department of Defense's reminder to its chain of command that aggressive proselytizing is a violation of the First Amendment rights of our service members and is unacceptable. Brenda Weber, Lawton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Weber is co-founder of the Lawton Area Secular Society, described as a social network for atheists, agnostics, skeptics and nonbelievers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious freedom exists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regarding &quot;Military religious freedoms under attack, groups say&quot; (News, July 10): As a deployed service member, I'd like to assure U.S. Rep. Jim Bridenstine, R-Tulsa, that my religious freedom isn't under attack. In fact, the chaplain corps where I am has done an outstanding job of accommodating and respecting the beliefs and practices of religious and nonreligious personnel. To bolster his specious charge, Bridenstine also uses a George Washington quote to question the military judgment of the commander in chief. Likewise, I question Bridenstine's fitness as a member of Congress if he feels that making far-fetched attacks on the president is a constructive use of taxpayer time and money. Brian Crain, Oklahoma City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Promote peace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Feb. 26, 2012, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin met 29-year-old George Zimmerman on the dark streets of an Orlando, Fla., suburb. Zimmerman shot Martin dead. On July 13, 2013, Zimmerman was declared not guilty of second-degree murder. The confrontation, death, trial and acquittal are controversial. Thousands have demonstrated. Millions of social media messages have included death threats. My advice? When meeting someone on a dark street do not break their nose. Instead, greet them with a friendly, &quot;Good evening.&quot; Do not knock them down to ride them like a horse. Instead, offer an open hand for a firm grip. Do not bash their head against the concrete until bloody. Instead, start a respectful conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, do not expect assaulted people to remain passive. Nowadays, some may have a gun to protect themselves from attacks. Politeness promotes peace. John Terneus, Yukon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delusional idea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response to Jim Barlow (Your Views, July 7): The earth's climate has been changing for the past 3.5 billion years, without any help from humans. A single large hurricane demonstrates nature's ability to produce energy exceeding that of the largest nuclear weapon ever tested. A single volcanic eruption produces more greenhouse gases than the largest reduction in those gases the entire country can achieve in a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same climate models that are supposed to prove that humans are almost entirely responsible for changes in climate have been unable to explain why the earth's temperature has remained unchanging for the past 15 years. Fact is, the climate would continue to change if the human race disappeared entirely. So it's delusional to think that by imposing economically destructive abuse on society, we can make it all stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The good news: Climate change takes place slowly. This gives us time to adapt - so long as we don't remain in denial. Panic and hysteria hardly ever work to our benefit, forcing us into bad choices. Climate change adherents would make more headway by sending a positive message about the benefits of clean energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, they just sound like Chicken Little, which hurts their cause. Charles P. &quot;Pat&quot; Kelley, Oklahoma City</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THREE of the six jurors in the George Zimmerman trial believed that he was guilty of murder or manslaughter when they retired to consider their verdict, one of the all-female panel has admitted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The juror, who appeared on CNN in silhouette to maintain her anonymity, disclosed how the three were talked out of convicting Mr Zimmerman for killing Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, during more than 16 hours of deliberations. During jury selection, the same woman described the dead teenager as a &quot;boy of colour&quot; and called the killing &quot;an unfortunate incident that happened&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her comments will stoke further controversy after she described how jurors found the laws &quot;very confusing&quot; and struggled to follow the judge's instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She also appeared to show sympathy for Mr Zimmerman, whom she frequently referred to as George, and disparaged the chief prosecution witness as lacking credibility because of poor education and communication skills.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 29-year-old neighbourhood watch volunteer shot the 17-year-old dead after calling police because he thought the teenager was acting suspiciously as he walked home through a gated community in Sanford, Florida.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THREE of the six jurors in the George Zimmerman trial believed that he was guilty of murder or manslaughter when they retired to consider their verdict, one of the all-female panel has admitted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The juror, who appeared on CNN in silhouette to maintain her anonymity, disclosed how the three were talked out of convicting Mr Zimmerman for killing Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, during more than 16 hours of deliberations. During jury selection, the same woman described the dead teenager as a &quot;boy of colour&quot; and called the killing &quot;an unfortunate incident that happened&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her comments will stoke further controversy after she described how jurors found the laws &quot;very confusing&quot; and struggled to follow the judge's instructions. She also appeared to show sympathy for Mr Zimmerman, whom she frequently referred to as George, and disparaged the chief prosecution witness as lacking credibility because of poor education and communication skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protests against the verdict continued for a third night and turned violent in Los Angeles. Plans for demonstrations in more than 100 cities this weekend were unveiled as civil rights leaders increased pressure on the Justice Department to bring federal hate crime charges against Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 29-year-old neighbourhood watch volunteer shot the 17-year-old dead after calling police because he thought the teenager was acting suspiciously as he walked home through a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Mr Zimmerman was cleared after defence lawyers argued that he had shot the schoolboy in selfdefence after being attacked by him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The juror, only known as B37, said she was one of three who supported clearing Mr Zimmerman. Two others believed he was guilty of manslaughter and one of second-degree murder. She said Mr Zimmerman's &quot;heart was in the right place,&quot; but he should have stayed in his car when asked to do so by a police dispatcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday the US attorney general Eric Holder criticised so-called &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws. Addressing Mr Zimmerman's acquittal, he said the laws &quot;sow dangerous conflict&quot; by encouraging violent situations &quot;to escalate in public&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI - Civil rights leaders said Tuesday they are planning vigils and rallies in 100 U.S. cities this weekend to press the federal government to bring charges against a former neighbourhood watch volunteer acquitted in the killing of an unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman had been charged with second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin last year, but a jury of six women found him not guilty of that charge as well as the lesser charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People all across the country will gather to show that we are not having a two- or three-day anger fit. This is a social movement for justice,&quot; Rev. Al Sharpton said as he announced the plan outside the Justice Department in Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rallies and vigils will occur in front of federal court buildings at noon Saturday in cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was visiting his father and returning to the home of his father's fianc&eacute;e after a trip to the store when Zimmerman identified him as a potential criminal. The neighbourhood watchman fatally shot Martin during a physical confrontation in the gated community in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton says vigils will be followed by a conference next week in Miami to develop a plan to address Florida's &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; law. The law gives people wide latitude to use deadly force if they fear death or bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said such laws, which exist in many states, need to be reassessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Separate and apart from the case that has drawn the nation's attention, it's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defence and sow dangerous conflict in our neighbourhoods,&quot; Holder said during a speech before a convention of the NAACP civil rights group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, protests over Zimmerman's acquittal had broken out as far away as California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Los Angeles, people ran through streets on Monday night, breaking windows, attacking people on sidewalks and raiding a Walmart store, while others blocked a major freeway in the San Francisco Bay area in the third night of demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourteen people were arrested after multiple acts of vandalism and several assaults in Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Los Angeles police vowed on Tuesday to crack down with quick action and arrests if further disturbances arise. Demonstrators must remain on sidewalks on Tuesday night and will be arrested if they commit any crimes or block traffic, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For those of you who were here last night and came for the wrong reasons, if you come here again tonight, you will go to jail,&quot; police Chief Charlie Beck said at a news conference.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't see why so many people are making such a big deal about the Trayvon Martin case. Regardless of the racial inference, it's just another example of a law abiding citizen being killed by another law abiding citizen with a gun. (In this case, of course, the law abiding citizen also had a concealed carry permit and a 'stand your ground' law, a lethal combination.) Yes, George Zimmerman was, and still is, a law abiding citizen, and he still has his gun.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what's the big deal? These tragedies happen every day in this country. As they say, guns don't kill people. People with guns kill people.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During my eight decades on this third rock from the sun, I have been in cities and rural areas in all 50 states and on six continents and have never been faced with a need to violently defend myself beyond a fist to the nose of a bully. Those occasions were in my teens. The only times I have felt afraid was when a couple of my law-abiding Rambo wannabe friends bragged about their &quot;packing (licensed) heat.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beginning at about age 12, I hunted with a .22 rifle and a 12-gauge shotgun. There were three un-breakable rules (which many people seem to ignore these days): never point a gun at anything or anyone you don't intend to shoot, never take a loaded gun in the house and always assume that all guns are loaded.<BR><BR><BR><BR> While serving 3 c years in the U.S. Army (post Korean War) I qualified with all of the late '50s individual weapons and several crew-served weapons. It is sad to see how many current activists, politicians and talking-heads haven't even bothered to learn the difference between automatic and semi-automatic weapons. Nor between a clip and a magazine. Probably 95 percent of the pistols and rifles produced since 1940 are semi-automatic. Defining an &quot;assault&quot; weapon by appearance is totally meaningless. It is silly to defend the need for high capacity magazines for self-defense or hunting. If you can't hit a moving target during three or four shots, you should be quickly surrendering to your aggressor or giving up on your hunt.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Perhaps sane, non-felon Americans should have the right to keep and bear individual firearms, preferably openly rather than concealed. But the argument that the 2nd Amendment has anything to do with target practice, gun collecting, protecting oneself from muggers, stopping public massacres or game hunting is utter nonsense! Nor was it intended to defend against foreign invaders.<BR><BR><BR><BR> The 2nd Amendment was only intended for citizens to be able to collectively protect themselves from their own federal government. See Federalist No 46. It was written at a time when a preponderance of citizens armed with muskets could prevail over a federal (British) army which also depended on muskets and possessed only a small contingent of artillery.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Since then, most government-owned armies have acquired overwhelming firepower. The American Civil War proved for all time that the U.S. government could prevail over even a very large number of armed citizens and that brother can be persuaded to fire on brother -- literally!<BR><BR><BR><BR> The militia mentioned in the 2nd Amendment referred to state militias that reported to the state Governors. The state militias are no longer independent of the Federal government but became the National Guard, which has been under control of the President since the Militia Act of 1903.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Although it isn't going to happen, the 2nd Amendment should be intelligently debated and perhaps re-written to specifically cover those activities mentioned above.<BR><BR><BR><BR> By the way, if the law-abiding George Zimmerman had not elected to carry his legal handgun, he would probably have allowed the police to handle the suspicious Trayvon&nbsp;Martin or, at worst, would have survived with a broken nose, a scared scalp and an intact reputation. And he would have saved over $1 million in defense attorney fees. And how many millions of prosecuting attorney costs? And Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would still be alive.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Glenn Selch lives in Erie.  </SPAN></P>

After she was dropped by her literary agent, a juror in the George Zimmerman trial has decided against writing a book on the high-profile case, she said in a statement, citing the &quot;depth of pain&quot; many in the public associate with it. The woman known publicly only as B-37, her jury selection designation, said that serving in sequestration as a juror &quot;shielded me from the depth of pain that exists among the general public over every aspect of this case.&quot; ? R&amp;B singer Lester Chambers is recovering from injuries he suffered over the weekend after a woman leaped onto the stage and shoved him when he dedicated a song to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin during a concert in the San Francisco Bay Area. Family members said Chambers had a bruised rib muscle and nerve damage after he was attacked Saturday at the Hayward Russell City Blues Festival. Witnesses reportedly heard 43-year-old Dinalynn Andrews Potter shout &quot;it's all your fault&quot; before shoving Chambers, 73. Andrews Potter was arrested on suspicion of battery. ?

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What some of the nation's political commentators are saying about the verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoodies blind people to truth </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know if Zimmerman is a racist. Yet I'm tired of politicians and others who have donned hoodies in solidarity with Martin and who essentially suggest that I am a racist for recognizing the reality of urban crime in America. The hoodie blinds them as much as it did Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Cohen, Washington Post Writers Group</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't retry Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you believe that Zimmerman killed Martin because of his race, it's easy to understand the appeal of the civil rights charge. The question for advocates, then, is simple: Would you still support bringing charges even if you believed Zimmerman would get off again? For the NAACP, the answer may be yes. But for the government, the decision to prosecute must also take account of the odds of success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noah Feldman, Bloomberg News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A wrenching coda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a way, the not guilty verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman for his killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was more powerful than a guilty verdict could ever have been. It was the perfect wrenching coda to a story that illustrates just how utterly and completely our system of justice both moral and legal failed Martin and his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles M. Blow, The New YorkTimes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed and loaded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As soon as passions cool, assuming we let them, the discussion that needs to take place surrounds a question: What was George Zimmerman doing walking around his neighborhood armed and loaded? In what world is this normal behavior? The answer: Not a world most of us want to live in. Let's start there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathleen Parker, Washington Post Writers Group</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right to be young</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation we need to have is about how black men, even black boys, are denied the right to be young, to be vulnerable, to make mistakes. .... Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was fighting more than George Zimmerman that night. He was up against prejudices as old as American history, and he never had a chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eugene Robinson, Washington Post Writers Group</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida tried, at least</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What matters most is that Zimmerman was charged with Martin's killing, even if he wasn't convicted. The state was late to indict him, yes, and acted only after a sorry spell of botched police work that may have affected the evidence presented at trial. But Florida did try to hold George Zimmerman liable for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emily Bazelon, Slate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Learn from mistakes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you want to prevent the next Trayvon&nbsp;Martin tragedy, learn from their mistakes. Don't paint the world in black and white. Don't declare the whole justice system racist, or blame every gun death on guns, or confuse acquittal with vindication. And the next time you see somebody who looks like a punk or a pervert, hold your fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Saletan, Slate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we learned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict is in for the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin George Zimmerman case. What did we learn? Being a vigilante is a dangerous hobby. Juvenile bravado can get you killed. Mark O'Mara is a hell of a defense attorney. We also learned that the jury had no choice but to vote &quot;not guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Zimmerman not guilty,&quot; July 14 news story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't see why so many people are making such a big deal about the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case. Regardless of the racial inference, it's just another example of a law abiding citizen being killed by another law abiding citizen with a gun. (In this case, of course, the law abiding citizen also had a concealed carry permit and a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, a lethal combination.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, George Zimmerman was, and still is, a law abiding citizen, and he still has his gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what's the big deal? These tragedies happen every day in this country. As they say: &quot;Guns don't kill people. People with guns kill people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as more law abiding citizens get more and more guns, more and more law abiding citizens will be killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dennis McDaniel, Boulder</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one very important way, the Zimmerman not guilty verdict will turn out good for the nation. Not good for true justice the guy did kill an unarmed kid. But any other verdict would not have galvanized the citizenry or the media to a real debate about the menace of underlying racism in the United States. I shudder at the thought of being a young black person in America with the fear, anger and cynicism that those kids must live with.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Federal case on shooting possible,&quot; July 15 news story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal government vs. George Zimmerman seems like an unequal contest, doesn't it? Attorney General Eric Holder has weighed in, much as President Obama did shortly after the shooting, leaving little doubt as to their biases. Let's face it: The administration is not going to waste this opportunity to pander to minorities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biennial of the Americas: just a marketing stunt?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Image building,&quot; July 15 news story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I am a strong advocate of the arts, I can't understand the hype surrounding the Biennial of the Americas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Want to bring great minds together to discuss important issues? Take a lesson from the University of Colorado's Conference on World Affairs, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. In comparison, the Biennial of the Americas just seems like an excuse for wealthy sponsors to attend lavish parties. Sadly, Ray Mark Rinaldi's article only reinforced this view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a Denver native and someone who knows all that our wonderful city has to offer, I think Rinaldi needs to reconsider what is &quot;truly interesting.&quot; Want to show others what our city has to offer? How about investing more in our education, our libraries, and in art and culture that is accessible for all and not just an elite few? Rinaldi makes the Biennial sound like just another marketing stunt, and perhaps that's all it is.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Disappointed in DU law prof's treatment,&quot; July 12 letter to the editor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was very touched by University of Denver law graduate Patricia McEahern's response in support of Professor Lucy Marsh, who has filed a gender based wage bias lawsuit against DU. Often, no truer truths are told than those by powerless students who have had firsthand experiences of mistreatment through the inner workings of a university department that have gone awry. Even more often, sadly, a university or other system that is violating the rights of its faculty and students fails to respond until the spotlight is publicly shined on problems of immense proportions that are otherwise swept under the rugs of the hallowed halls. It takes someone like Professor Marsh to speak up and stand up for her rights, and in so doing she stands up for the rights of other female professors who have been discriminated against by the university. She also stands up for all DU students, who, at best, have but a muted voice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Six inconvenient truths,&quot; July 11 Ramesh Ponnuru column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramesh Ponnuru has written a well thought out piece that brings up many real problems with Obamacare. But he leaves out the biggest of all of the inconvenient truths. And that is that the real problem with health care in the U.S. has nothing to do with the government, but with ourselves. The crisis lies in our own health, not in how the care is administered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our food is now brought to us from factories, not farms. It is produced by some of the world's largest chemical companies rather than farmers. And the average American spends hours every day in front of the boob tube, and practically no time at all involved in any physical activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until we as a nation change all of these things, it matters not what President Obama or anyone else does or says. It is up to us to get ourselves healthy again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The multiple benefits of co op education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Colleges offering more career prep,&quot; July 15 news story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was pleased to see your article on career preparation. In particular, I was pleased to see the coverage of co op education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the workplace experience benefits of co op education, the more basic benefit is the opportunity to work one's way through college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I worked my way through college in the 1960s on the co op education program at the University of Houston, a pioneer of co op education. It took considerably longer than four years to graduate, but I would not trade for the experience and the pride of having worked my way through college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years ago when my oldest son started to college at the University of Colorado at Boulder, I inquired about a co op plan. The response that I got was not only no, but they acted like they were insulted that I had even asked. This kind of attitude on the part of universities needs to change if they are to be responsive to the needs of the 21st century. They should be embracing co op education and building partnerships with business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-member jury that acquitted neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman did not believe race played a role in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, the first juror to speak publicly about the trial says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror, identified only as Juror B37, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday night she and the other jurors believed the screaming voice captured on a 911 recording belonged to Zimmerman, and lent little credibility to a key witness who spoke to Martin on the phone before he died. They also put limited faith in the testimony provided by Martin's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said anything a mother and father would say,&quot; said the juror, who said she wanted to keep her identity secret and was almost invisible in deep shadow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 said she believed Martin was the aggressor - and added she had &quot;no doubt&quot; that Zimmerman feared for his life during the confrontation in a Sanford, Florida, housing complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think his heart was in the right place,&quot; she said of Zimmerman. &quot;It just went terribly wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think he's guilty of something?&quot; Cooper pressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he's guilty of not using good judgment,&quot; she responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, the juror said, was &quot;overeager to help people&quot;. She added that she believed he was &quot;was pretty consistent and told the truth&quot; to investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Juror B37 said she was sympathetic to Zimmerman throughout the trial, she said the jury was initially divided. Three members of the all-female jury wanted to find Zimmerman not guilty, two believed a manslaughter verdict was appropriate, and one supported a finding of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All six members found the law to be &quot;very confusing&quot;, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after reading the definitions of second-degree murder and manslaughter &quot;over and over&quot;, the jurors reached consensus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had a right to defend himself,&quot; Juror B37 said of Zimmerman. &quot;If he felt threatened, that his life was going to be taken away from him or he was going to have bodily harm, he had a right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before ending her interview with Cooper, Juror B37 broke down in tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want people to know that we put everything into everything to get this verdict,&quot; she said. &quot;We didn't just go in there and say, we're going to do guilty/not guilty. We thought about it for hours and cried over it afterwards. I don't think any of us could ever do anything like that ever again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is known about Juror B37 came from her comments as she was being interviewed by both sides before the trial began, that she is middle-aged, has two grown children, once had a license to carry a concealed weapon and worked for a chiropractor for 16 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite keeping her identity secret, Juror B37 has already secured an agent to peddle an as-yet unwritten book.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prominent civil rights activist the Rev Al Sharpton said the rallies and vigils would be staged on Saturday at federal buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department is investigating whether he violated the black teenager's civil rights when he shot the 17-year-old during a confrontation in Sanford, Florida, in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighbourhood watch volunteer, 29, said he fired his gun in self-defence, and a six-member jury acquitted him of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence erupted on the West Coast during protests over the acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Los Angeles police said about 150 people broke off from a larger, peaceful protest and began walking through the streets, committing multiple acts of vandalism and several assaults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 300 officers were called to the scene but they held back from directly engaging with the protesters in an attempt to allow a peaceful end to the demonstration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirteen people were arrested and officers warned they would adopt a much stricter stance if the protests continued for another night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least one person was injured and police made nine arrests when another protest turned violent in Oakland.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Jesse Jackson had a jailhouse meeting with Marissa Alexander in Jacksonville Tuesday, then followed it with an appeal to State Attorney Angela Corey to use her influence in getting the 32-year-old woman's 20-year mandatory sentence reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson spent an hour in the morning with Alexander, who was sentenced in a case in which she said she was only guarding herself from an abusive husband. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her case has regained attention following George Zimmerman's acquittal of all charges in 17-year-old Trayvon Martin's death, which was deemed self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is something patently unjust about this,&quot; Jackson said in front of the Duval County jail after meeting Alexander. &quot;A woman was not guilty of shooting or killing anyone is in jail for 20 years. A man who did kill someone is walking free. The gap is too great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, he spoke with Corey and made what he called a &quot;moral appeal&quot; for her support in getting the sentence changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Corey listened during their phone conversation but said the case and mandatory sentence had been determined by the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She says it is out of her jurisdiction,&quot; Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calls for comment to spokeswoman Jackelyn Barnard of the State Attorney's Office were not returned Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander refused prosecutors' offer of three years in prison following her arrest in 2010 on three charges of aggravated assault for firing the gun. She was found guilty and given a state-mandated 20 years that took the discretion out of the judge's hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said if the state once offered Alexander three years, Corey should consider that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If she doesn't think she deserves 20 years, she should say that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander has already been in jail almost three years, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At least I made our case on a moral appeal,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surrounded by pastors after meeting Alexander, Jackson said he will be at a 5 p.m. rally Wednesday at Mount Olive Primitive Baptist Church at 1319 N. Myrtle Ave. to highlight her case and mobilize public opinion. He said the Rainbow Push Coalition, which advocates for civil rights, will continue to work on Alexander's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole world is watching Marissa Alexander's case now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and Alexander did not meet in her cell but in another room at the jail, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She is amazingly strong and sound and clear in her thinking and with a very strong and dedicated prayer life,&quot; he said. &quot;She is overwhelmed by the idea of facing 20 years in jail, perhaps in prison, and has done no one any harm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said the Alexander and Zimmerman cases are examples of failures in the justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We see radical racial polarization in the judicial system,&quot; he said. &quot;That's a cause of great concern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander was sentenced for firing what she and her supporters have called a warning shot against an abusive husband. It was mandatory under the &quot;10-20-Life&quot; statute. Two young children were in the vicinity at the time, according to the arrest report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York domestic abuse attorney Michael Dowd agreed to take over Alexander's case as it heads into an appeal. Tuesday, Dowd said the appeal has been filed and attorneys are waiting to be told if oral arguments will be needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First and foremost, the case was overcharged,&quot; Dowd said in a phone call to his office. He said the results were out of proportion to how the case should have been resolved and agreed with Jackson's efforts at a resolution outside the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would think anything he could do to lessen or do something about the sentence would be a good thing, better than a good thing, a great thing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of George Zimmerman in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin shooting ends a criminal case but not the tragedy that will hover and haunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't change that the unarmed black teen was killed by Zimmerman, a white Latino, during a night-time February 2012 confrontation in a Sanford neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't change that, given his full acquittal, Zimmerman spent months in agonizing legal limbo and now emerges with life and reputation forever altered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't change that we'll never truly know what happened the night Martin and Zimmerman met, as a hoodie-clad Martin walked to his father's girlfriend's house in the gated community that Zimmerman sought to patrol and protect as part of a neighborhood watch group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLOARIZING AND POLITICIZED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it doesn't erase the shameful reality that during the nearly 18 months since Martin's death, the case has become so nationally polarizing and politicized that both the slain youth and acquitted defendant have ceased to be viewed as actual humans in the eyes of so many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that cynical, shameless lot - liberal and conservative alike - Martin and Zimmerman are nothing more than symbols that can be eagerly exploited to fit a myriad of self-centered agendas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the most enduring tragedy of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case may be yet to come: That will be if his death and Zimmerman's resulting acquittal yield no lasting lessons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One overriding lesson of Zimmerman's trial and acquittal in this social-media age of snap judgments and instant verdicts is that the test of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is often far more daunting than we want to believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the bar of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman was guilty of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin or even culpable on a manslaughter charge was far too high for prosecutors to ever clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did Zimmerman shoot in self-defense because he was being savagely beaten by Martin? Which person was the one actually screaming for help on a tape?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If basic questions like these eluded definitive answers, how reasonable was it to expect a jury to push aside its heavy responsibility to be sure beyond a reasonable doubt and return a guilty verdict?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By all accounts, the Zimmerman trial jury assumed its burden with the serious gravity and deliberation that the case warranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In doing so, it met the only true obligation that we could demand from a committed jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reasonable doubt was all that was needed to acquit George Zimmerman. And reasonable doubt was there - clearly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict should be accepted as such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MORE LESSONS FROM THIS CASE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is another inescapable lesson of the Martin case: Racial profiling does take place in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was being racially profiled on the February 2012 night as he walked through the townhouse neighborhood where he was ultimately shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was a young black male in a neighborhood that had experienced sporadic crime, mostly carried out by black males. He was a young black male wearing a hoodie at night - a visual image that in reality stirs an instant, visceral sense of unease in many people of all types.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It strains credibility to dismissively insist that if Martin wasn't who he was - wearing what he was, where he was - he would have been just as likely to be noticed by Zimmerman that winter night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or that someone else, totally different from Martin's profile, would have been as relentlessly followed by Zimmerman even after being advised by police to stop trailing Martin and avoid a confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a society, we must continue to have a genuine dialogue about that reality and seek ways to change it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Martin case does not lead to that conversation, it will be a lost opportunity - added to a lost life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the underlying racial tensions that lead to profiling and unjustified suspicions do not change, then we will have failed in making ours a more just and livable society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And more young people will continue to die on our streets and sidewalks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must strive to change a culture in which young blacks have to act differently and be more careful when approached by police or neighborhood watch volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For black youths, wearing hoodies, running and maybe just being black in the wrong setting often endangers their safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is deplorable and we all - especially those who enjoy white privilege - must take steps to change it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other lessons would suggest that neighborhood watch programs while valued must ensure adequate training for participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The often murky details of the trial made it clear that Zimmerman apparently went beyond the accepted role of a neighborhood watch volunteer when he ignored police guidance not to approach the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNDERLYING RACIAL TENSIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of Martin and the trial of Zimmerman have produced no shortage of searing, emotional heat. And appropriately so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, going forward, they must produce some illuminating light for all of us. The kind of enlightenment that can result when we are forced to do some productive soul-searching about where we are as a society.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer representing the man who shot and killed 17-year-old Jordan Davis expects State Attorney Angela Corey to come after his client even harder now that she's lost the George Zimmerman case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I worry they're going to say, 'We lost Zimmerman, so let's get Michael Dunn.'&nbsp;&quot; Cory Strolla said following a hearing Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both cases involve black teenagers killed and speculation that racism or profiling were factors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was acquitted last week in Sanford on charges that he killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Martin was black and Zimmerman is Hispanic. Corey's office was the special prosecutor in the case and lost when Zimmerman's lawyers argued it was self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunn, who is white, is charged with first-degree murder and three counts of attempted murder. The 46-year-old Brevard County man faces life without parole if he's convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last November, Dunn opened fire on a Dodge Durango with Davis and three other black teenagers inside after a dispute over their loud music at a Southside Boulevard gas station in Jacksonville. Before the shooting, police said Dunn turned to his girlfriend and said, &quot;I hate that thug music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunn told police he thought the teenagers were pointing a gun at him during an exchange of words. But no gun was found in the vehicle or on any of the teenagers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey is personally prosecuting Dunn but was not in court Tuesday for the pretrial hearing. Assistant State Attorney Erin Wolfson represented the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey, Wolfson and spokeswoman Jackelyn Barnard could not be reached for comment after Strolla spoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's hearing was the first since Judge Russell Healey replaced judges Suzanne Bass and Mallory Cooper, who each excused themselves from the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strolla sought Bass' removal after accusing her of misconduct and bias against his client. Cooper is now handling another high-profile case, Donald James Smith for 8-year-old Cherish Perrywinkle's sexual assault and death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bass denied Dunn bail, refused a motion to have the state declare him indigent and pushed to have the trial in September even though his attorneys said it was unrealistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a new judge, Strolla sought to revisit bail and Dunn's indigent status. But Healey denied both requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Dunn had been declared indigent, the state would have been required to pay for investigations Strolla wanted to conduct into the crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bass and Healey both denied the motion because Strolla is being paid $7,500 a month to represent Dunn. Strolla said Dunn's parents are paying him, and not Dunn himself, but both judges said that didn't matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strolla also reiterated his previous statement that he would not be ready for trial in September and told Healey the earliest he could be prepared is February. Healey told Strolla he wanted to try the case this year, but for now the trial date remains set for Sept. 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next hearing is scheduled for Aug. 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney John Phillips, who represents the Davis family, said the family would have no comment as they left the courthouse after the hearing. But as they walked away, Ron Davis, father of Jordan, looked back and said, &quot;It was a good day.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami: Three jurors in George Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial initially favored convicting him of that offense or manslaughter, but the six-woman jury ultimately voted to acquit him in the killing of an unarmed black teenager after more closely examining the law, a juror in the case has said, reports AP. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch volunteer, was charged with second- degree murder in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin last year, but the jury also was allowed to consider manslaughter. The woman, known as Juror B37, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday that when the jury began deliberations Friday, they took an initial vote. Three jurors, including B37, were in favor of acquittal, two supported manslaughter and one backed seconddegree murder. She said the jury started going through all the evidence, listening to tapes multiple times.<BR><BR>&quot;That's why it took us so long,&quot; said B37, who said she planned to write a book about the trial but later had a change of heart. When they started looking at the law, the person who initially wanted second-degree murder changed her vote to manslaughter, the juror said. Then they asked for clarification from the judge and went over it again and again. B37 said some jurors wanted to find Zimmerman guilty of something, but there was just no place to go based on the law, B37 said jurors cried when they gave their final vote to the bailiff.<BR><BR>&quot;I want people to know that we put everything into everything to get this verdict,&quot; said the juror, whose face was blacked out during the televised interview but who appeared to become choked up. The interview came two days after the jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Martin in a gated community in Florida.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Author, poet, and activist Maya Angelou was shaken by the verdict of the George Zimmerman trial, saying it shows &quot;how far we have to go&quot; as a country. &quot;That one man, armed with a gun can actually profile a young man because he is black and end up shooting him dead...It is so painful,&quot; Angelou said in an interview with TIME Monday. The case, which was decided Saturday, has caused deep divisions across the country. Some believe the verdict was a grave injustice. Others believe Zimmerman was acting in self-defence and had every right to stand his ground against Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angelou, however, believes the verdict's impact will affect people from all communities across the country. &quot;What is really injured, bruised, if you will, is the psyche of our national population,&quot; Angelou said. &quot;We are all harmed. We are all belittled, and we give to the rest of the world more ammunition to sneer at us. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the verdict people have stepped out in protest in cities across the country, echoing cries of  &quot;No Justice, No Peace,&quot; on behalf of the slain teen. Angelou said the acts of protest evoke memories of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s  &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech during the 1963 March on Washington, which is approaching its 50th anniversary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angelou, who received the Presidential Medal of Arts in 2000, worked for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which was led by Dr. King, during the Civil Rights Movement. In 1993, she delivered the inaugural poem for incoming President Bill Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28, 1963, King delivered the celebrated speech during which he said, &quot;I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The family of the late Trayvon Martin, a black American teenager, should be encouraged to seriously consider a civil action for wrongful death against George Zimmerman. The legal consequences of the death of Mr. Martin, who, though unarmed, was shot and killed, should be determined in a more satisfactory manner than occurred in Mr. Zimmerman's criminal trial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last weekend, Mr. Zimmerman was acquitted by a Florida jury, on criminal charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter. He may have believed that he was acting in self-defence, but, if so, there is grave doubt that this was a reasonable belief. The U.S. Department of Justice may be considering the possibility of a federal civil-rights prosecution, but this is not a promising route. One essential element of this hate-crime offence is a racist motive; in the nature of things, it is difficult to get inside someone else's head, particularly on such a fraught matter as racial prejudice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In contrast, a civil action by Mr. Martin's family would have a lower standard of proof, on a balance of probabilities, rather than &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking to the convention of the largest black American sorority in the U.S., Eric Holder, the Attorney-General, prudently, and properly, called Mr. Martin's death &quot;unnecessary,&quot; in other words, avoidable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The jury's decision was disturbing, appearing to validate some unreasonable fears. On the other hand, in contrast to past decades, there have been no violent protests against the verdict. Meanwhile, jury selection has taken place in a similar case in Wisconsin, about the death of a black 13-year-old. It is to be hoped that it proceeds fairly. But in the Martin case, a civil action may yet produce a better balanced result. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. Attorney-General Eric Holder told a major civil rights convention that &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; self-defence laws that have been adopted in 30 states should be reconsidered.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Holder was addressing the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Orlando, 25 miles from the small city of Sanford, Fla., where jurors on Saturday found former neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Separate and apart from the case that has drawn the nation's attention, it's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defence and sow dangerous conflict in our neighbourhoods,&quot; Mr. Holder said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Holder also related personal stories about being racially profiled as a young adult and stopped by police when he was committing no crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Trayvon's death last spring caused me to sit down and have a conversation with my own 15-year-old son, like my dad did with me,&quot; Mr. Holder said. &quot;This was a father-son tradition I hoped would not need to be handed down.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the Stand Your Ground law, people fearing for their lives can use deadly force without having to retreat from a confrontation, even when it is possible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;By allowing - and perhaps encouraging - violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety. The list of resulting tragedies is long and, unfortunately, has victimized too many who are innocent,&quot; Mr. Holder said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We must stand our ground to ensure that our laws reduce violence, and take a hard look at laws that contribute to more violence than they prevent,&quot; he added, to extended applause. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His speech was well received by the audience of NAACP members from across the country. &quot;We heard what we were hoping to hear today,&quot; said NAACP president Ben Jealous. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the second day in a row, Mr. Holder called the death of Martin, an unarmed black teenager, &quot;unnecessary,&quot; raising questions about whether he believed Zimmerman acted in self-defence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the verdict the Justice Department said it would reopen its investigation into the case to determine whether any civil rights laws had been violated by the state court handling it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Holder said all available information would be considered and &quot;the complicated and emotional issues this case raised.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Zimmerman's lawyers used the Stand Your Ground law to argue that he acted in self-defence. It was the first time Mr. Holder has addressed the Stand Your Ground issue. Then again, the Department of Justice has only limited authority to change such state laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The jury in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case rejected the second-degree murder charge that Mr. Zimmerman acted with ill will, spite or hatred. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 800,000 people have signed an online NAACP petition asking Mr. Holder to file civil rights charges against Mr. Zimmerman, the association said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An editoial from the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peaceful protests in the wake of George Zimmerman's acquittal should not dissolve into complacency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They should inspire renewed activism in the U.S. to change gun laws and societal attitudes so that armed confrontations are not encouraged, as they are today in places like Florida, and so that people who end up shooting and killing unarmed individuals have some responsibility if their own actions brought on the confrontation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We say peaceful protests because the violence and destruction committed by small numbers of protesters - vandals, really - in Oakland and other cities have no political legitimacy. Anger over Trayvon Martin's death is understandable, but the impulse to destroy property and attack blameless individuals is never justified. The peaceful marchers and the millions more Americans who had visceral reactions to this case are the ones capable of productive action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are, consciously or not, on common ground with former congresswoman Gabby Giffords and others fighting for sensible gun laws and sensible attitudes toward gun violence. The toll it takes nationwide, with murder rates rising after decades of decline, makes it a major public health threat of our day. Its victims disproportionately are young men of colour - often dying at the hands of others of the same race. While the Martin case aroused outrage because it began as racial profiling, the other deaths too often are shrugged off. That is wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's gun changed the dynamic on that fateful night. Calling 911 to report the suspicious character - Martin was walking at night while black and wearing a hoodie - Zimmerman was told not to pursue him. Surely he would have heeded that instruction had he not felt the invincibility of carrying a firearm in a state that glorifies the right to kill rather than avoid a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the societal effect of stand-your-ground laws passed by Florida and some 20 other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was upset at being followed. He may well have jumped Zimmerman in a fit of stupid male teenage machismo. But if Zimmerman had done what he'd been told to do, no one would have been hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case has to reinforce the fears of black families. They need to teach their children not only to obey the law but also how to behave so as not to raise suspicions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if a black man in a hoodie had decided a white teenager walking in his neighbourhood looked suspicious? What if police told him not to follow the kid but he did anyway? And what if, when the white kid attacked him, he pulled a gun and shot him - really, does anyone think that black man would not have been immediately arrested? Wouldn't police have looked at why he stalked the kid in the first place? Didn't the teenager have reason to be afraid?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin will leave a legacy if this trial inspires more Americans to look critically at their gun laws and the behaviour they encourage. Behaviour like that of George Zimmerman. Criminal or not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My son, who is now 21, used to have a fondness for Irn-Bru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irn-Bru is a carbonated drink manufactured in Scotland, vividly orange in colour. Its main ingredient, after carbonated water, is sugar, and a 250 millilitre portion runs to 107 calories. My daughter drew my attention to a controversy, reported by The Guardian, over a recent Irn-Bru ad, which you can find on YouTube.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad features a mom who's just purchased (and is wearing) a new push-up bra, which she's not afraid to talk about, together with her embarrassed adolescent son and his two fascinated friends. They are fascinated not by the garment but by what is being pushed up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The son's embarrassment is caused by the contrast between the mother's self-confidence in talking about her bra to her son and his hormone-filled friends' fascination with his mother's breasts. He pauses to take a swig of Irn-Bru and his embarrassment disappears as he becomes able to respond to his mom as a real person. Unlike his Irn-Bruless friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My first response was to think that the ad was outrageous; it sexualized a mother and objectified a woman in a politically incorrect way. I was about to write an apoplectic letter to the editor urging that the ad be banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then I had second thoughts, so I showed the ad to my son and asked him what he thought of it. He told me it was all about mortification and embarrassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That answer made me pause. Two people, watching the same thing, have completely different interpretations. OMG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I live in a different world from my children. My view of what the world is like and how it works was formed in the England of the 1950s and 1960s in a single-sex school. It was the era portrayed by Mad Men and the Cleaver family; the era of an Empire becoming independent; an age in which homosexuality was illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My children's views were formed in the Canada of the last 25 years; the era of Degrassi High and The Simpsons; a predominantly liberal, multicultural, peacekeeping country that welcomed immigrants of all stripes; a time of gay pride and same-sex marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir said the male-dominated societies of her time saw women as other. To see someone as other is to see them and define them as you yourself are not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since you are a fully formed decent human being (obviously), then the other is not. To see someone as other is to dehumanize them, to stereotype them and to treat them as a thing rather than a person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we treat people as things, we can exclude them from our moral world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are free to do more or less whatever we like with objects. No one thinks it's wrong to kick a rock, because a thing doesn't have feelings and cannot feel pain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If George Zimmerman sees Trayvon Martin as other, then for Zimmerman - and those who see all black people as other - it's OK to kill him because he's not a person. If we don't see others as people just like us, then it's OK to bully them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we don't see fellow students or co-workers as people just like us, then it's OK to be mean to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we don't see children as people then it's OK to spank them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we don't see the homeless as people, then it's OK to ignore their plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to change the way we see the world, but the world changes. I need an Irn-Bru moment to help me deal with the world as it now is, my son doesn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not suggesting that we should all carry vivid orange sugar-saturated drinks around with us to help us better cope with life's difficulties.Rather that in an uncomfortable situation we might try to act otherwise than we are naturally inclined to do; reflection before action may help us to become a better person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Particularly when we see people as other.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Holder insisted it was time to look again at legislation such as the state's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law when he addressed the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) in Orlando, close to the central Florida town of Sanford where George Zimmerman killed Martin in February last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such legislation, which allows individuals to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger, eliminated &quot;the commonsense and age-old requirement&quot; that people who felt threatened had a duty to retreat. &quot;These laws try to fix something that was never broken,&quot; Holder said. He urged a &quot;hard look at laws that contribute to more violence than they prevent&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech by Holder, the country's first African American attorney general, came at the end of a day of intense debate about the fallout from the Zimmerman verdict. The jury of six women accepted his contention that he had killed Martin, who was 17 and unarmed when he was walking home from a convenience store, in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the jurors was forced to abandon a plan to write a book about her experience after an angry social media backlash. A New York publishing house, Martin Literary Management, issued a statement declaring it had rescinded its offer of co-operation to the middle-aged woman, known only as juror B37, &quot;after careful consideration&quot; in response to thousands of critical messages on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman gave a television interview on Monday night in which she revealed that the jury was initially split over Zimmerman's guilt, with only three believing he should be found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Orlando, Holder was warmly received by delegates at the NAACP, who have been vocal in their demands since the verdict was announced on Saturday for Zimmerman to face a federal civil rights prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder repeated his promise that Martin's &quot;tragic and unnecessary&quot; death would be fully investigated by the Department of Justice as it determined whether federal action could be taken. &quot;But independent of the legal determination, I believe this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly and openly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder described in personal terms how, like other black parents in America, he had discussed with his 15-year-old son how to interact with police. &quot;This is a sad reality in a nation changing for the better in so many ways,&quot; Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also emerged yesterday that Stevie Wonder has announced he will not perform in Florida or any other state with the self-defence law. The singer said in a video of a concert in Canada that &quot;until the stand-your-ground law is abolished in Florida I will never perform there again&quot;. Wonder added: &quot;Wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You report on the anger in America at the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin (&quot;Protests as man is cleared of killing black teenager&quot;, The Herald, July 15).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is the verdict may well have been correct under Florida law, something that is shocking to us in this country. The difficulty is the &quot;Stand your ground&quot; laws in many states including Florida (tellingly known in one state as the &quot;Make my day&quot; law) confirm that if someone feels in danger they are entitled to use deadly force, with a low threshold to demonstrate this, and explicitly state there is no requirement for the force to be proportional. These laws have been pushed by gun manufacturers in an effort to encourage gun sales and the result is killers walk free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been some suggestion federal authorities might attempt to try Mr Zimmerman on civil rights charges in the manner used to try racist murders in the south when they knew there was no prospect of conviction in state courts. There is also a chance Mr Martin's family will attempt to sue Mr Zimmerman for civil liability. Either case may in some way limit the danger of the precedent this verdict sets but it should be remembered that no verdict will bring back Trayvon Martin and the best that can be done is for Florida to reconsider its laws that effectively decriminalise murder in certain cases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice failed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin the night he was killed. We should be appalled and outraged, but perhaps not surprised, that it failed him again Saturday night with a verdict setting his killer free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our society considers young black men to be dangerous, interchangeable, expendable, guilty until proven innocent. This is the conversation about race that we desperately need to have - but probably, as in the past, will try our best to avoid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's acquittal was set in motion Feb. 26, 2012, before Martin's body was cold. When Sanford, Fla., police arrived on the scene, they encountered a grown man who acknowledged killing an unarmed 17-year-old boy. They did not arrest the man or test him for drug or alcohol use. They conducted a less-than-energetic search for forensic evidence. They hardly bothered to look for witnesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a national outcry forced authorities to investigate the killing seriously. Even after six weeks, evidence was found to justify arresting Zimmerman, charging him with second-degree murder and putting him on trial. But the chance of dispassionately and definitively establishing what happened that night was probably lost. The only complete narrative of what transpired was Zimmerman's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors knew that Zimmerman was an overeager would-be cop, a self-appointed guardian of the neighborhood who carried a loaded gun. They were told that he profiled Martin - young, black, hooded sweatshirt - as a criminal. They heard that he stalked Martin despite the advice of a 911 operator; that the stalking led to a confrontation; and that, in the confrontation, Zimmerman fatally shot Martin in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors also knew that Martin was carrying only a bag of candy and a soft drink. They knew that Martin was walking from a 7-Eleven to the home of his father's girlfriend when he noticed a strange man in an SUV following him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To me, and to many who watched the trial, the fact that Zimmerman recklessly initiated the tragic encounter was enough to establish, at a minimum, guilt of manslaughter. The six women on the jury disagreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those jurors also knew that Martin, at the time of his death, was just three weeks past his 17th birthday. But black boys in this country are not allowed to be children. They are assumed to be men, and to be full of menace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know if the jury, which included no African-Americans, consciously or unconsciously bought into this racist way of thinking - there's really no other word. But it hardly matters, because police and prosecutors initially did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assumption underlying their ho-hum approach to the case was that Zimmerman had the right to self-defense but Martin - young, male, black - did not. The assumption was that Zimmerman would fear for his life in a hand-to-hand struggle but Martin - young, male, black - would not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anyone wonders why African-Americans feel so passionately about this case, it's because we know that our 17-year-old sons are boys, not men. It's because we know their adolescent bravura is just that - an imitation of manhood, not the real thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know how frightened our sons would be, walking home alone on a rainy night and realizing they were being followed. We know how torn they would be between a child's fear and a child's immature idea of manly behavior. We know how they would struggle to decide the right course of action, flight or fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we know that a skinny boy armed only with candy, no matter how big and bad he tries to seem, does not pose a mortal threat to a healthy adult man who outweighs him by 50 pounds and has had martial arts training (even if the lessons were mostly a waste of money). We know that the boy may well have threatened the man's pride, but likely not his life. How many murders-by-sidewalk have you heard of recently? Or ever?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation we need to have is about how black men, even black boys, are denied the right to be young, to be vulnerable, to make mistakes. We need to talk about why, for example, black men are no more likely than white men to smoke marijuana but nearly four times as likely to be arrested for it - and condemned to a dead-end cycle of incarceration and unemployment. I call this racism. What do you call it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was fighting more than George Zimmerman that night. He was up against prejudices as old as American history, and he never had a chance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RAGE, it seems, is all around us. Rage and violence. Sometimes  hate. Sometimes misunderstanding. Sometimes no understanding at  all.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    We feel one way about that lack of understanding when it happens  far away from us, in another part of the country, such as in the  recent trial in Florida of George Zimmerman for the shooting death  of teenager Trayvon Martin.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We feel another way about the lack of understanding when it hits  closer to home, as it did in the weekend slaying of Brian  Topoleski, 18, a recent graduate of Cedar Grove High School. We  don't know exactly all the circumstances surrounding the young  man's death, but we do know that another young man, 20-year-old  Jonathan Lafontaine of Totowa, who had some previous brushes with  the law, has been charged with first-degree murder in a case that  Passaic County Prosecutor Camelia M. Valdes described as &quot;a  senseless tragedy.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Certainly, we live in a society where that term has become all too  commonplace. But this case, reportedly the first slaying in Little  Falls in some 30 years, seems truly to live up to the billing, the  type of killing that forces us to take a breath, to reexamine the  very foundations of our basic belief in community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Indeed, to put faith in the prosecutors' version of the chain of  events that led to Topoleski's death is to shake our collective  head, to suspend belief in common sense. According to Valdes, what  began as a case of mistaken identity involving two sets of young  people in automobiles turned into something heated, then something  violent, then to death by stabbing of one young person by another.  To read the prosecutors' narrative, sadly, is to read of events  that might, on any number of occasions, have taken a different  turn, a more peaceful turn.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In the end, whatever words might have been spoken in anger, or  whatever altercation may have occurred between Topoleski and  Lafontaine, those of us of a certain age can believe it bears  resemblance to another altercation that, had it happened 20 or 30  years ago, might have resulted in a broken jaw or a black eye. How  that escalation turned into a few split seconds of deadly violence  is what's so difficult to grasp.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;This was an exchange -- an exchange that went terribly wrong,&quot;  Valdes said. &quot;It's one of those things where you just have to shake  your head because they don't know each other, and it could have  ended at so many different points. ... We're trying to figure all  that out.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Tragically, what we seem to see more and more of in modern society  is a breakdown, not just between right and wrong, but along with it  deep-seated disregard for human life. Arguments, increasingly, are  not settled by words, not even by fists, but by whatever weapons  happen to be nearby. We have a lot of work to do, it seems, to  begin to bend back toward even the most basic civilities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Regarding &quot;Law &amp; order: Concern, tears among backs after Zimmerman  acquittal&quot; (Page A1, July 15):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No matter if you agree or disagree with the George Zimmerman  verdict, there can be no disagreement over the reason why Trayvon  Martin is dead. Zimmerman had a gun that night, and the state of  Florida allowed him to carry it virtually anywhere despite a  violent history.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Stand Your Ground law, also known as &quot;Shoot First,&quot; has created  a slippery slope where you can literally stalk someone, start a  fight and, if you are losing that fight, pull out a gun and shoot  that person and get away with it. Stand Your Ground says you have  no duty to retreat and that you can use lethal force if you  perceive or imagine there to be a threat.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Zimmerman was emboldened to get out of that car and confront Martin  because he had a concealed handgun and he knew how the law worked.  We know states that have such laws have had increases in homicide  rates, so why does the National Rifle Association keep promoting  them?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Whatever the reason, more needs to be done to end senseless gun  violence in this country. Just since the Newtown, Conn., massacre  last December, at least 119 children and 308 teenagers have been  shot and killed in the United States.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    This case was about more than racial injustice or the politics of  gun violence. It was about a kid who was just trying to get home.  The death of Martin was a tragedy for all of us. Ask yourself: Are  you doing all that you can to prevent gun violence?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    You can start by encouraging Governor Christie to sign the  gun-violence prevention bills the Legislature has passed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Last week in the Money section, there was an article reporting how  gas prices were falling. There was high production, extra gas in  storage, stable crude prices as well as shipments arriving from  other countries where demand was low. The article also mentioned  demand was down due to more fuel-efficient cars.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Since then I have noticed gas prices rising slowly. A more recent  story reports that gas prices are on the rise. Production has been  cut for refinery maintenance and crude oil prices are rising. What  gives? Doesn't this sound like price manipulation?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Perhaps it coincides with summer vacation and the fact that more  people are driving. If the oil companies could produce enough  gasoline last month, why can't they do it now?  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Regarding &quot;More schools turn to student drug testing&quot; (Page A1,  July 8):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Becton Regional High School in East Rutherford led the way for  random drug testing back in 1985.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    I was on the regional Board of Education at that time and was  opposed to the format of the policy proposed. I argued that  teachers, secretaries, custodians and board members should also be  tested. What good is drug testing just the students when others in  the school system needed it just as much?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The drug culture was prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, some  of these former students are leading a new generation of youth with  much more knowledge and experimentation with drugs than our  generation ever knew. If I voted again, even more than ever before,  I would vote yes for random drug testing for all - not just the  students.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to the nation's largest civil rights group in Orlando, several miles from where a jury returned the Zimmerman verdict, Holder said the state laws jeopardize the public's safety and &quot;sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods,&quot; Holder said in his annual remarks to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples (NAACP). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must examine laws that take this further by eliminating the common-sense and age-old requirement that people who feel threatened have a duty to retreat, outside their home, if they can do so safely.&nbsp;By allowing and perhaps encouraging violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws allow a person to use deadly force against an attacker even if they are able to retreat safely from a volatile situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law was often discussed in the Zimmerman case, but he did not seek to use it during his trial. The law did, however, prevent police from arresting Zimmerman after the shooting. The 29-year-old Zimmerman was eventually charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter after killing the unarmed 17-year-old Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights groups throughout the country have been waging, so far unsuccessfully, grassroots campaigns to try and get such &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder delivered Tuesday's remarks as the NAACP stepped up pressure on the Justice Department to pursue federal hate crime charges against Zimmerman under the department's civil rights division. As of Tuesday, more than 1 million people had signed a petition urging the DOJ to take up the case, according to the NAACP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a choice,&quot; Ben Jealous, president of the NAACP, wrote on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can be felled by our sorrows over the jury's decision. Or we can turn our frustration into action. We will demand the Department of Justice address the travesties of this tragedy. &nbsp;We will advance our movement to end racial profiling in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Zimmerman's acquittal, the DOJ has restarted its own investigation of the case, which was initially launched last year but put on hold as state prosecutors took the lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder said that the DOJ may move forward on civil rights charges against Zimmerman, but only if the evidence suggests wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we move forward together, I want to assure you that the department will continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law,&quot; Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are committed to doing everything possible to ensure that &macr; in every case, in every circumstance, and in every community &macr; justice must be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder's speech Tuesday was also a broader attempt to spark a national conversation on race, taking the lead from his decree in 2009 that the nation is made up largely of &quot;cowards&quot; when it comes to addressing the sensitive subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the nation's top cop called on communities to hold a &quot;respectful, responsible dialogue,&quot; Holder described two instances in which he himself was racially profiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder also described sitting his 15-year-old son down in the wake of the Martin slaying and talking to him about how he should act if he feels he is ever profiled for being black by a cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was stopped by a police officer while simply running to a catch a movie at night in Georgetown in Washington, D.C.&quot; Holder recalled. &quot;I was at the time of that last incident a federal prosecutor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must confront the underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs and unfortunate stereotypes that serve too often as the basis for police action and private judgments,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many supporters of Martin, who was African-American, believe Zimmerman racially profiled him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House press secretary Jay Carney on Tuesday said President Obama believes that much progress has been made in addressing racism and racial disparities, though there is more work to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no question that we've made enormous progress,&quot; Carney said. &quot;There's no question that we still have progress to make.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the House, Rep. Luis Guti&eacute;rrez (D-Ill.) called on the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing on Martin's shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the verdict &quot;undermines the rule of law, erodes community trust in law enforcement, and exemplifies just how dangerous the combination of rampant fear and easily available guns can be.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) are readying a flurry of bills in response to George Zimmerman's acquittal of charges in last year's fatal shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmakers are drafting proposals intended to rein in racial profiling; scrap state stand-your-ground laws; and promote better training for the nation's neighborhood watch volunteers, among other anti-violence measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CBC members had remained largely silent throughout the trial, but following the verdict, argued forcefully that, decades after the civil rights movement, the nation's criminal justice system still discriminates against blacks and other minorities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), an icon of the civil rights era, said the decision &quot;seems to justify the stalking and killing of innocent black boys and deny them any avenue of self-defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), head of the CBC, decried &quot;the presumption of guilt so often associated with people of color.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A six-member jury on Saturday found Zimmerman, whose father is white and mother is of Peruvian descent, not guilty of killing the African-American Martin last year in a gated community in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was a neighborhood watch volunteer who began following Martin and ended up in a physical confrontation with the 17-year-old. During a trial that earned blockbuster ratings on cable television, the two sides fought over who was the aggressor. The jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter after the defense argued he shot Martin while in fear for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury member interviewed by CNN said the panel did not believe Zimmerman was motivated by race when he began following Martin, who was wearing a hoodie and was on his way to his father's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But CBC members said they strongly believed that race was a motivating factor in the incident in arguing for the racial profiling law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Zimmerman targeted Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as a potential criminal because Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is black,&quot; Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told MSNBC Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyone who denies that racism isn't alive today, particularly in the so-called justice system, is exceedingly delusional,&quot; said Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), who wore a hoodie on the House floor last year in a demonstration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This verdict points to the reality that there are far too many walking America's streets wearing a hoodie, carrying snacks and soft drink, which can result in a 'death sentence' particularly if they are young, black and male.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading the legislative charge is Rep. John Conyers Jr. (Mich.), the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee and a CBC member, who for years has pushed legislation to curtail racial profiling in the nation's law enforcement agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conyers's proposal is still being crafted, but past iterations have barred any law enforcement agent from targeting people based solely on race, gender or religion. It would also mandate race-sensitive training as a condition of receiving federal funding and require the Justice Department to provide Congress with periodic reports detailing discriminatory profiling practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), a CBC member who represents the Sanford neighborhood where Martin was killed, said problems would persist until Congress acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until we pass meaningful laws against profiling, Americans will continue to be singled out and arrested for driving while black, shopping while black, walking while black and just plain being black,&quot; said Wilson, who's also working on the racial profiling bill. &quot;My own children, and nearly all of the young men I know, have been stopped by the police at least once, for no apparent reason.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zimmerman did not use Florida's stand your ground law in his defense, it has received an enormous amount of attention &macr; in part because it was a reason why police initially did not arrest Zimmerman in Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevie Wonder has said he will boycott the state of Florida because of its stand your ground law, which allows people to use violent force to avoid retreating from an unlawful threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson said she's also working on legislation offering financial incentives to states that repeal stand your ground laws; creating training programs for neighborhood watch volunteers; and establishing a &quot;Federal Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys&quot; designed to &quot;increase graduation rates, improve student performance, and ultimately break the school-to-prison pipeline&quot; that's plagued that population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of the entrenched partisanship of today's Congress, however, such proposals face a high bar, leading some CBC members to seek other solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), for instance, had responded to Martin's shooting last year with legislation requiring all neighborhood watch volunteers to register before taking to the streets. But this year, she's withholding that proposal because, a spokesman said, &quot;We just don't see it being politically viable at this moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Jackson Lee is calling on the DOJ to launch a unilateral investigation into racial profiling across the country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A version of this story first appeared in the July 26 issue of The Hollywood Reportermagazine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hitting ratings highs with the late-night July 13 verdict, the Big Four cable news networks more than justified their decision to dedicate hours of airtime to the George Zimmerman trial and acquittal in the shooting death of black teen Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHOTOS: 10 TV Trials That Shook The World</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN and HLN offered wall-to-wall coverage and saw the biggest percentage gains in total viewers and in the key 25-to-54 demo. HLN in particular, with the draw of host Nancy Grace whose seen previous ratings surges for coverage of Jodi Arias and Casey Anthony's murder trials, saw the greatest gains. The network, typically in last place, saw its total day viewership leap 80 percent from the year-to-date average in the final week of the trial. CNN saw a significant demo advantage with an average 393,000 adults 25-54. (That's 66 percent north of the 2013 average.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dominant Fox News, focusing on Egypt, the Asiana Airlines crash and other breaking news as well as Zimmerman, also was up by a small margin -- as was the politically focused MSNBC. FNC still brought in a dominant haul for both the final week (1.14 million viewers) and the night of the verdict (2.4 million viewers in primetime). MSNBC fell to fourth, behind HLN, a position it first dropped to back in May during the Arias climax.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interest in the trial also shows no sign of slowing. Monday gets such as Anderson Cooper's juror interview and Piers Morgan's sit-down with the prosecution's star witness Rachel Jeantel continue to move the dial. CNN managed to top cable in the targeted demo -- and Morgan's exclusive reaped his best ratings ever, 678,000 viewers in the targeted demo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's coverage remained fixed on Zimmerman, especially on HLN and CNN, while shifting focus to mounting backlash to the verdict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lester Chambers -- a member of the Chambers Brothers, best known for their 1968 hit &quot;Time Has Come Today&quot; -- had a bruised rib muscle and nerve damage after he was attacked Saturday at the Hayward Russell City Blues Festival, family members told The San Jose Mercury News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers dedicated the Curtis Mayfield hit &quot;People Get Ready&quot; to the slain Florida teen, the newspaper reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said 43-year-old Dinalynn Andrews Potter of Barstow yelled &quot;it's all your fault&quot; before shoving 73-year-old Chambers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrews Potter was arrested on suspicion of battery, cited and released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, was found not guilty of second-degree murder in last year's death of Martin, who was black. The jury had the option to consider manslaughter but declined to convict him of the lesser charge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in California made several arrests on Monday evening as demonstrations continued against the acquittal of neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin following an altercation in a gated Florida housing community in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call for action followed the admission by one female juror that three of her fellow members were initially inclined to convict Mr Zimmerman. The woman, known only as Juror B-37, offered a glimpse behind the scenes of the jury's deliberations in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper . She explained how, after 16 hours of discussion, the six women came to the conclusion that Mr Zimmerman ought to be acquitted of the second-degree murder of 17-year-old Trayvon, whom he claimed to have shot in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a couple of them in there that wanted to find him guilty of something,&quot; she said. &quot;And after hours and hours and hours of deliberating over the law, and reading it over and over and over again, we just decided there's no other way or place to go [but acquittal].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B-37 is a white, middle-aged chiropractor from Seminole County in Florida, where the shooting and subsequent trial took place. She and her husband, a lawyer, have two grown-up children. In the first poll of the six jurors, she explained, three favoured finding Mr Zimmerman not guilty, two voted for manslaughter and one for second-degree murder. She said that the jury worked hard to reach a verdict and cried over the decision. &quot;I want people to know that we put everything into it,&quot; she said. &quot;We thought about it over and over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, however, they could find Mr Zimmerman guilty of nothing but poor judgement. The neighbourhood watch volunteer followed Trayvon on the night of the killing in February 2012, apparently believing him to be a criminal; the two had an altercation, which ended with Mr Zimmerman shooting Trayvon in the chest. &quot;George Zimmerman is a man whose heart was in the right place, but just got displaced by the vandalism in the neighbourhood and wanting to catch these people so badly that he went above and beyond what he really should have done,&quot; the juror said. &quot;He had a right to defend himself. I think Trayvon got mad and attacked him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On one crucial point, she said most of the six jurors believed it was Mr Zimmerman who could be heard calling for help in the background of a recorded 911 emergency call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights activists have urged the Department of Justice to investigate the killing as a racially motivated hate crime. But Juror B-37 told Cooper that the panel, five of whom were white, did not believe that race was a factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the singer Stevie Wonder announced during a concert on Sunday that he would not perform in Florida until the state's Stand Your Ground law - which allows people to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger - is abolished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict made the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case a double tragedy. Beyond the courtroom theatrics and the legalistic maneuvers within the past couple of weeks, the fact remains, an unarmed black teenager was proactively pursued and killed and no one will be held accountable for this tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course this case was about race. The people marching before the verdict and crying after the verdict were overwhelmingly African American. The folks that seem to focus only on the factual nuances of the case seem to be overwhelmingly non-African American. For those focused solely on the law, the right verdict was rendered because the defense won the courtroom tug of war. According to the jury's verdict, the prosecution could not prove Zimmerman's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ubiquitous &quot;facts vs. emotions&quot; argument seems to be the dichotomy that highlights the racial divide. The legal experts stated that the facts should trump emotions. This mindset was evident from choosing the jury at the outset to explaining the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict at the end. For African Americans, however, the verdict was another assault on common sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first text that I received about the verdict was from one of my young black male mentees: &quot;The verdict hurt &quot;c crazy, no manslaughter, nothing, disgusting.&quot; I think this text reflects the sentiment of many African Americans and others. The chants of &quot;No justice, no peace,&quot; have resonated in multiethnic demonstrations throughout the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was not only about race, it was also about the threat of black masculinity in American society. Historically, from Emmett Till to Rodney King and beyond, the life of the young black male in American society seems to be valueless. We cannot deconstruct the Zimmerman case without looking at it in the broader context. Zimmerman profiled Trayvon as a threat because America has stereotyped the young black male as a threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This summer, I have been running the BLOOM Reintegration Academy for 15 previously incarcerated black males ages 14-18 from South Los Angeles. This five-week summer program brings these young men to a college campus and immerses them in academic, career-development and life-skills modules. Some of these youth have been incarcerated for things ranging from fist fighting to petty theft. Imagine their thoughts about the paradoxical Zimmerman verdict. A text I received from one of my 16-year-olds in the program stated, &quot;That man should have gotten life or the death penalty. If Trayvon had killed him, he would have gotten life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the verdict in this case, the big-picture question is how do we move forward in dealing with young black men in America? The deliberate criminalization of this population is problematic. Incarceration, police brutality and murder are not feasible solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, the sword of the problem is doubled-edged. Although the young black male has been intensely stereotyped, he has intensely embraced these stereotypes instead of contradicting them. The enthusiastic embrace of the gansta-thug persona has become detrimental to an entire generation of young black men. Internally, the African American community needs to address this phenomenon in order for progress to be made. Externally, every educator, police officer, counselor and politician should be held accountable for their policies and behavior toward this population in order for progress to be made.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passions continued to simmer two nights after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin as protesters broke store windows, stopped traffic, and attacked cars and pedestrians. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters angered by the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin ran through the streets of Los Angeles, breaking store windows, stopping traffic, and attacking passing cars and pedestrians late Monday night as passions continued to simmer two nights after the verdict in Florida. At least a dozen people were arrested. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest began at 6 p.m. as a ''prayer rally'' in Leimert Park that was organized by Project Islamic HOPE, but police officials said about 150 people broke off from that peaceful gathering and began committing vandalism and assaults. The Los Angeles Police Department declared a tactical alert at 9 p.m. as crowds swelled in the streets, and the police later declared an unlawful assembly, allowing them to arrest protesters who did not clear the streets. Fourteen people were arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are a better city than what we have seen tonight in the hands of a few people, and we will make sure that the community here in South Los Angeles is safe on its streets,'' the city's new mayor, Eric Garcetti, said at a news conference Monday night. He appealed to the protesters to remain peaceful. ''The Martin family didn't ask anybody to break car windows,'' he said. ''They didn't ask anybody to take little kids' scooters. They didn't ask anyone to attack businesses. And they certainly didn't say to take over traffic in the streets.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unrest in Los Angeles, the site of several nights of deadly rioting after the 1992 acquittal of police officers in the Rodney King beating, saw anger once again boil over. Protesters broke windows at Walmart and several other stores. They ran through the streets, blocking traffic and repeatedly jumping on stopped cars, kicking them, dancing on the hoods. A local television news crew was attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Twenty-one years ago we witnessed what could happen when there's a reaction to a verdict,'' said Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles County supervisor who represents South Los Angeles. ''Similar sentiments are being expressed here in this space, but the response of the L.A.P.D. is qualitatively different. It has taken a posture of respecting the constitutional rights of those who choose to peacefully express their point of view, even at the point of protest.'' He urged protesters to remain nonviolent, which he called ''the most effective way to communicate how to address injustice.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new Pew Research Center weekend survey finds that a mere 26% of Americans followed Zimmerman's trial for second degree murder of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin &quot;very closely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and NAACP chief Ben Jealous have shown in media appearances that they are racial arsonists, stoking the flames of racial discord in a country that has virtually eliminated the discrimination that existed before the civil rights era.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton became known, of course, with the Tawana Brawley outrage in 1987, in which white police officers were falsely accused of rape and racist violence. Jealous' NAACP this week absurdly called the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin killing a &quot;modern-day lynching,&quot; in spite of Zimmerman being Hispanic, not white, and of his tutoring black children for free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider the facts that negate the media's ludicrous narrative of Zimmerman's not guilty verdict:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VThe U.S. elected and just re-elected a black president -- despite his many failures and broken promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VCelebrity chef Paula Deen lost major corporate endorsements for using a racial epithet decades ago, proof institutional support for racism is nonexistent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VThe U.S. attorney general, the nation's chief law enforcement officer, is black, making it impossible to argue that the establishment is anti-black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VMany publications and other media outlets will print the f-word, not the n-word -- even for explanatory purposes -- fearful of even the whiff of racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VThe white-dominated Occupy movement's rent-a-mob methods were on display in many demonstrations after after the verdict -- not the big, nationwide grassroots uprisings many in the media predicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Sharpton, the NAACP and other self-appointed &quot;leaders&quot; really cared about those they supposedly lead, they might answer this question:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's life more valuable than the thousands of anonymous black teens gunned down every year in this country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Children's Defense Fund last year released a report showing that homicide is the leading cause of death among black teens, and that young black males get shot dead 2-1/2 times more than Latino males, and eight times more than white males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, as CNS News reported, in the 20 days of the Zimmerman trial alone, four minors -- three teens and a 5-year-old boy -- were shot dead in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why don't they focus their energies on that crisis -- and the generational moral calamity at its root?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's older brother Robert put it best, speaking to Fox's Greta Van Susteren:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the race profiteers, they have a business model,&quot; the &quot;Jesse Jacksons, Al Sharptons, Ben Jealouses of the world, and they have to promote racism in order to see that they don't become obsolete.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of protesters staged boisterous but peaceful protests in Los Angeles and San Francisco late on Tuesday against the acquittal of a neighborhood watch volunteer charged with murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police and civic leaders appealed for calm but braced for more unrest after nearly two dozen people were arrested in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay area late on Monday in a second night of protests over a case that has captivated and polarized the US public on race, gun and self-defense laws.<BR>Protesters said they were angry at what they saw as a miscarriage of justice in the verdict reached on Saturday by Florida jurors who found George Zimmerman, the white-Hispanic man who shot Martin, not guilty of murder or manslaughter.<BR>Public comments from one of the six jurors stoked anger further as they were widely regarded as too sympathetic toward Zimmerman, who said he acted in self-defense. He was accused of having singled out Martin as suspicious because he was black.<BR>CNN said on Tuesday four other jurors released a statement distancing themselves from the juror's comments.<BR>About 100 demonstrators, many of them holding placards bearing Martin's likeness, gathered in front of City Hall in downtown Los Angeles early in the evening chanting, &quot;Your son, our son. We are all Trayvon&quot; and &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot;<BR>&quot;This is not just a protest. It's a movement for justice all across the country,&quot; organizer Eugene Puryear, 27, from Washington, D.C., shouted to the crowd.<BR>&quot;We won't get off the streets until there's justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RICHARD LUSCOMBE in Miami, and PAUL LEWIS in WashingtonAn angry backlash has forced a juror in the George Zimmerman murder case to abandon plans to write a book about her experience, as activists at the biggest civil rights group in the US tore up the agenda at their annual convention yesterday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York publishing house Martin Literary Management issued a statement saying it had rescinded its offer of co-operation to the middle-aged woman, known only as juror B37, &quot;after careful consideration&quot; in response to thousands of critical messages on social media. The woman gave a television interview on Monday night in which she revealed the jury was initially split over Mr Zimmerman's guilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Orlando, Florida, less than 30 miles from where Mr Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin dead last year, delegates at the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People stepped up their pressure on the Obama administration to launch a federal prosecution against Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New chargesFormer officials from the US department of justice have been playing down the chances of new charges, which would require a prosecutors to prove Mr Zimmerman was motivated by race when he confronted and the fatally shot the teenager in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But attorney general Eric Holder raised hopes about the prospects of a fresh prosecution on Monday when he said he shared concerns about the &quot;tragic, unnecessary death&quot; of Mr Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any decision about a federal trial is likely to take months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests continued around the US in the wake of the verdict, with 14 arrests at demonstrations that turned violent in Los Angeles late on Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 appeared to express regret for pursuing a book deal. The woman, one of the six female jurors who on Saturday acquitted Mr Zimmerman, released a statement saying she had realised the sensitivities surrounding the three-week trial, during which the jury was sequestered, only after returning home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With her face blacked out, she appeared in a television interview on Monday night, revealing that only three members of the six-woman panel had initially voted to acquit Mr Zimmerman. Two thought he was guilty of manslaughter, and one believed he was guilty of the original charge, second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman said she and fellow jurors believed Mr Martin threw the first punch in the fatal confrontation, leaving Mr Zimmerman in fear of his life. That, she said, was the determining factor in why the three changed their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She insisted justice had been served. &quot;George Zimmerman is a man whose heart was in the right place, but just got displaced by the vandalism in the neighbourhood . . . he wanted to catch these people so badly that he went above and beyond what he really should have done,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It just went terribly wrong,&quot; she added. &quot;Things just got out of hand. I think he's guilty of not using good judgment.&quot; - (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Guardian</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> service)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the father of a teenage boy who sometimes wears a hoodie and sometimes ventures out for sweets and a soft drink, I can instantly relate to the parents of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As someone who doesn't own a gun, lives on a street with no gate, and confines my neighborhood watch activities mostly to chasing off raccoons delving into the next door neighbour's garbage - as was the case last night - I have a harder time relating to George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, I am not in the least surprised that Zimmerman was acquitted by a Florida jury of six women in the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was always going to be reasonable doubt because there was no decisive eyewitness, no video and, most critically, the law was on the side of the man with the gun, not the kid with the skittles candies and iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the way it is in Florida. That's the way it is in a lot of states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it happened, on the day that the jury came out with the not guilty verdict - on charges of murder in the second degree and manslaughter - I was standing at a grill at a barbecue talking turkey, and guns, with an FBI agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, this agent does not keep a gun at his home in Virginia, though he would be more than qualified to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that if I was a burglar in Virginia with one foot inside his home, and he did in fact have a gun, he would be required to first challenge me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I did not surrender or retreat, if I put my second foot into his home, he would be within his rights to shoot me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down in Mississippi, he said, I would only have to put a foot on the property and he could blaze away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was not on George Zimmerman's property. He was on a street in a gated community where he was staying. As such, he had just as much right to be there as Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's defence, however, rested heavily on Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which did confer effective property rights at the spot where Zimmerman stood when he first challenged 17-year-old Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This law, then, means that every space is &quot;your&quot; space when you feel threatened, as much as your kitchen or bedroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And you only have to have a reasonable fear that the other person is threatening you to reach for your weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the fact that the gun laws in Florida, Virginia, Mississippi, and a bundle of other states, are so farcically lax that Genghis Khan would qualify for an assault rifle, or indeed a truck load of them, it is no surprise at all that there are a lot of people walking around the place who might claim to be reasonably fearful for their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, it's the guy in the hoodie who could easily have a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So there is a perverse logic to all this, one that is eerily reflected in the dystopia envisioned by the National Rifle Association: everyone should be packing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps if Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had been carrying a gun things would have worked out differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe there would have been two dead people, a complete mystery with regard to what happened that night, and the taxpayer would have been saved the expense of a trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NRA has been kind of quiet on this one because, of course, it's tried and tested argument is that the victim dies because he/she is not armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ergo, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin should have been carrying too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case, is actually trickier for the NRA to comment on than, say, a mass slaughter of kids in a school by a gun-toting nut. So best say nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should ask ourselves,&quot; said President Obama, &quot;if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this. As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honour Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How to prevent future tragedies like this? Well good luck with that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to prevent another Trayvon&nbsp;Martin you would have to put the actual law on trial, not the likes of George Zimmerman, an armed idiot who didn't even know the people who were inhabiting the neighbourhood he was supposedly watching.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THREE of the six jurors in the George Zimmerman trial believed that he was guilty of murder or manslaughter when they retired to consider their verdict, one of the allfemale panel has admitted. The juror, who appeared on CNN in silhouette to maintain her anonymity, disclosed how the three were talked out of convicting Mr Zimmerman for killing Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager, during more than 16 hours of deliberations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During jury selection, the same woman described the dead teenager as a &quot;boy of colour&quot; and called the killing &quot;an unfortunate incident that happened&quot;. Her comments will stoke further controversy after she described how jurors found the laws &quot;very confusing&quot; and struggled to follow the judge''s instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also appeared to show sympathy for Mr Zimmerman, whom she frequently referred to as George, and disparaged the chief prosecution witness as lacking credibility because of poor education and communication skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests against the verdict continued for a third night and turned violent in Los Angeles. Plans for demonstrations in more than 100 cities this weekend were unveiled as civil rights leaders increased pressure on the Justice Department to bring federal hate crime charges against Mr Zimmerman. Veteran civil rights leader the Reverend Al Sharpton called yesterday for a 'Justice for Trayvon National Day of Action&quot; on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 29-year-old neighbourhood watch volunteer shot dead 17-year-old Trayvon after calling police because he thought the teen was acting suspiciously as he walked through a gated community in Sanford, Florida. He was cleared after defence lawyers argued that he had shot Trayvon in self-defence after the schoolboy attacked him. The juror, known only by her panel identity of B37, said she was one of three who supported clearing Mr Zimmerman. Two others believed he was guilty of manslaughter and one of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Mr Zimmerman was &quot;a man whose heart was in the right place,&quot; but believed that he did not show good judgment and should have stayed in his car when asked to do so by a police dispatcher rather than following Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On one crucial point of contention, she said most, if not all, of the six jurors believed it was Mr Zimmerman who could be heard calling for help on a recorded 911 emergency call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's mother and brother testified that it was Trayvon's voice screaming, while Mr Zimmerman's parents and several friends swore they recognised it as Mr Zimmerman's. Juror B-37 told Mr Cooper that the panel, five of whom were white, did not believe that race was a factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - The Anti-Defamation League issued a measured statement in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the murder of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teen Zimmerman killed last year in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case attracted national attention in the United States, as has the verdict, which spurred riots across the country as well as charges that racial bias has become ingrained in America's judicial system. Zimmerman, who shot Martin during a confrontation while on volunteer community watch, claimed self-defense based on a unique Florida law that allowed him to &quot;stand his ground&quot; when there is reasonable belief of an unlawful threat, without an obligation to retreat first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have great faith in America's jury system and do not question the verdict in the Zimmerman case,&quot; ADL's national director and chairman Barry Curtiss-Lusher and Abraham Foxman said in the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, this case raises serious questions about the wisdom of stand-your-ground laws and the easy access to concealed weapons permits in states like Florida, where more than one million permits have been issued since 1987 when the state's concealed weapons law went into effect,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADL acknowledged the racially charged nature of the case, though the first juror to speak publicly on the deliberations claims the subject was never breached when considering Zimmerman's verdict. Zimmerman has been accused of racially profiling Martin while on neighborhood watch.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of George Zimmerman on seconddegree murder in the shooting of Trayvon Martin has sent the U.S. into another round of angry debate over race and the law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida jury accepted that Zimmerman acted in self-defence but some African-Americans and their supporters see racism in the decision - that the case flows from a fear of young black men and a gun culture too quick to allow deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the racial elements of the case are less of an issue in Canada, confusion around what constitutes legal self-defence has been a problem. It's why the Conservatives brought in legislation that took effect in March to clarify when, and to what extent, citizens can use force to protect themselves, others and property. The Citizen's Arrest and Self-defence Act amended the self-defence sections of the Criminal Code, which were so confusing that judges had trouble explaining them to juries, leading to appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new simplified &quot;defence of the person&quot; has three key elements: a person reasonably believes that force is being used against them or another person or is threatened; that the act of self-defence is committed for the purpose of defending or protecting themselves or the other person; and that their act committed is reasonable in the circumstances. It lists nine &quot;factors&quot; for lawyers, juries and judges to consider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new act also allows reasonable steps to protect property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will still be up to the Crown, in whether to lay charges, and the courts, in whether to convict, to determine reasonable force, but the intent of the law is now more clear, which is a good thing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">558 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 17--&quot;You can't expect a victim to wait before taking action to protect herself and say, 'Excuse me, Mr. Criminal, did you drag me into this alley to rape and kill me, or do you just want to beat me up and steal my purse?'? &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer said in 2005, while she was helping to draft Florida's stand-your-ground bill, which would go on to become the first to pass in the country. Like Hammer, supporters of the law argued that people should be able to stand up for themselves against those who would harm them, whether inside their own home or in a public place. Opponents, including those in law enforcement, warned the proposal could encourage deadly violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, more than 30 states, including New Hampshire, have passed legislation to allow persons to use deadly force against another if they feel their life is in danger, whether or not they try to retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman didn't invoke Florida's stand-your-ground law in his defense against the second-degree murder charge he faced for shooting to death 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. He argued he acted in self-defense because Martin was hitting him and a jury of six women found that prosecutors hadn't proven otherwise, so they acquitted him. But in the year leading up to the trial, when it seemed possible that Zimmerman might rely on stand-your-ground, the case rightly drew national attention to those laws in Florida and other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reaching its verdict, the jury addressed only the legal issues in the case before it as defined by the criminal charge against Zimmerman. Where it failed to provide justice -- indeed, where the state's laws blocked it from doing so -- was in the most troubling aspect of Martin's death: that the confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin was completely avoidable, and that it was instigated by Zimmerman's hot-headed behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman wasn't being dragged into an alley by a would-be criminal intent on hurting him when he shot an unarmed Martin in the chest. He'd purposely ignored the directions of a police dispatcher and followed a 17-year-old kid walking home from the convenience store with tea and candy because he said he felt the young man was suspicious. What happened next, only Zimmerman was left to recount because Martin was dead and police found no witnesses. Would Zimmerman have so brashly pursued Martin if there wasn't a holstered pistol tucked inside his waistband? Would he have used deadly force in the struggle that ensued if the state's stand-your-ground law wasn't in place? We'll never know the answers to those questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't mean Americans should accept what happened and move on. Here in New Hampshire, lawmakers should take time to scrutinize the state's self-defense laws and again take up repeal of the stand-your-ground law, an effort that fell short earlier this year. Laws that allow people to provoke confrontations in public places and then face no consequences when the situation escalates and they kill someone rather than walk away are unacceptable. Granite Staters shouldn't wait for a tragedy such as the slaying of an unarmed teenager to reverse the unnecessary and potentially dangerous stand-your-ground law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A call to Paculis' court-appointed attorney was not answered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Letting cars drive decision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transportation Authority of Marin's latest efforts to redesign the Greenbrae-Highway 101 corridor continue to undermine the concept of multimodality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added northbound lanes will require the demolition of the pedestrian overcrossing, a facility that we sorely need if walking and biking from the Fifer Avenue/Lucky Drive area to the ferry terminal and the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit train and pathway are to be encouraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the near certainty of a parking charge at the ferry terminal, more people will be discovering foot and pedal power as a way to get there for free. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the new bike/pedestrian bridge over East Sir Francis Drake Boulevard will soon be built   truly   after many years of design work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The existing pedestrian overcrossing provides a natural feeder to that facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Wornum Drive and Redwood Highway, TAM plans to build one or more freeway off ramps, turning a simple one-lane pedestrian crossing into an intersection that is complicated and dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamal Vista Boulevard- Wornum is already the intersection from hell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Families on both sides of the freeway urgently desire safe pedestrian and bicycle access to and from local schools. Yet TAM disregards the care we owe our children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If our civic leaders truly support multimodality, it's time for them to put their collective feet down and tell TAM to &quot;walk the talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cindy Winter, Greenbrae</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collaboration the best way</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the &quot;debate&quot; over mountain bike use, some opponents are demanding such punitive measures as closing more trails to bikes, limiting times of use, huge fines and even confiscation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this kind of take-no-prisoners stance is a lose-lose proposition. The focus should be on finding the irresponsible and cowardly offenders, not using this incident as an excuse to justify a &quot;my way or the highway&quot; response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, why not form an alliance to offer a reward for apprehension?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My experience over more than 25 years of hiking throughout Marin is similar to that of the July 9 letter writer William Ward: &quot;Almost universally they (bikers) slow down, we share a friendly greeting and everyone continues on their own way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riding a horse on a trail is a glorious personal choice; by its very nature, though, it can be risky. I've seen horses become spooked by a fence and hard to control. I hiked many trails that have become hazardous to both two- and four-footed travelers because horse hooves have made them extremely uneven, bumpy and eroded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the ever-growing popularity of mountain biking, we need more trails for mountain bikes, not fewer   a need that local agencies have so far ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One solution could be for volunteers from the mountain biking community to construct new, responsible, bike-only trails under the watchful eye of authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operating from an &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality is not the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I second the July 11 Marin Voice column by Tom Boss and Kurt Kruger: collaboration not altercation, dialogue not diatribe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWIN CITIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military show welcomed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could not disagree more with Louis Reimers et al's characterization of the historical military presence at the recent Larkspur-Corte Madera July 4 parade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of vehicles was modest and in keeping with past parades. The community owes Joe Garbarino a debt of gratitude for maintaining this link to our past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tanks and troop carriers are the highlight of the parade for both young and old. To see what our fathers and grandfathers used to fight their way across Europe and the Pacific makes us appreciative of their sacrifice. They spew no more exhaust than the antique cars included in the line-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope the parade organizers completely ignore naysayers. After all, on July 4 we are celebrating an independence that was secured by force of arms.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A revealing contrast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your headline on the George Zimmerman verdict   &quot;Watch captain not guilty&quot;   certainly provides illumination how that jury came to its decision, yet also displays a revealing contrast for many of the rest of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, a jury took some comfort in a &quot;peaceful&quot; community looked over by an armed and zealous nitwit such as Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Grayson was expected to be released from jail Wednesday evening, pending further investigation of the case, officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference Wednesday in Marin City, supporters raised concerns about Novato police handling the criminal investigation. The wife of Deputy Evan Kubota, who fired the shots, works as a dispatcher for Novato police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a big conflict of interest,&quot; said the Rev. Emmanuel Akognon of Village Baptist Church, where Grayson is a member. &quot;I believe this investigation is starting on the wrong foot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are many police departments that can take this on,&quot; said Jonathan Matthews, a church member and attorney who fielded questions during the 30-minute press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Novato police officials could not be reached for comment. District Attorney Ed Berberian dismissed the idea of a conflict, saying that Novato police are &quot;professionals who will do their job&quot; regardless of the connection Kubota has with the department. He added that his office ultimately files charges, not the investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 100 people gathered at the church to get an update on the case, which has touched a raw nerve in the community that has a strained relationship with law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Chaka shooting and other recent events have really hit a nerve, it's almost like the clock has been turned back,&quot; Matthews said. &quot;This shooting is emblematic of a problem between the police and the community that has gone on way too long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grayson   who was shot twice in the arm during the July 7 incident   was being held at the Marin County Jail on a parole violation, but was not formally charged. Late Wednesday afternoon, Berberian announced the parole hold was being lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The investigation surrounding the circumstances of the shooting is ongoing and it would be premature to move forward with any criminal-related filings until that investigation is completed,&quot; said Berberian, adding he expected Grayson to be released Wednesday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Grayson has had problems with the law in the past, supporters said he was turning his life around and had completed construction training and apprenticeship programs while becoming a member of the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident began at about 5:50 p.m., when Kubota was on patrol along Terners Drive in Marin City. The deputy saw Grayson, whom he suspected of driving on a suspended driver's license, and made a U-turn and pulled in perpendicular behind Grayson's vehicle. There was a second vehicle parked in front of Grayson as well, according to an eyewitness report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the deputy got out of his patrol car, he noticed that Grayson ducked down as he approached. The deputy drew his firearm and ordered Grayson to show his hands. Instead, Grayson accelerated his vehicle toward the deputy, who believed his life was at risk and fired toward Grayson, according to the sheriff's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An eyewitness has said Grayson pulled his car out by only a foot or so when the deputy began firing and that it didn't appear that Kubota was in danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There needs to be a community response,&quot; said Makini Hassan, executive director of the Marin City Community Development Corp., who helped mentor Grayson. &quot;Chaka is our Trayvon Martin. Chaka is our Oscar Grant.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON _ The controversially concluded Florida murder trial of George Zimmerman has prompted fresh debate over whether &quot;stand your ground&quot; self-defense laws hinder violence or, perversely, propel it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence appears mixed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some studies show enhanced public safety. Others suggest the opposite. One study concluded that several dozen men a month are killed as a consequence of the laws. In a speech this week, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder showed himself to be among the skeptics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resulting ambiguity, like the Zimmerman trial itself, in which he was found not guilty of murdering 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, may confound anyone hoping for a neutral finding of fact. It also allows advocates and critics alike to cherry-pick their preferred experts, which can enliven debate but complicate lawmaking. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's good that whatever perspective you take is based on data, and not just anecdotes,&quot; Miami-based attorney Leigh-Ann Buchanan said in an interview on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buchanan is a co-chair of an American Bar Association task force that's studying stand-your-ground laws. The task force has held three hearings so far and it plans another next month in San Francisco. The group will report next year on various questions surrounding the laws, including how they &quot;may impact public safety,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, Holder joined those who assert that the stand-your-ground laws make matters worse. Addressing the NAACP on Tuesday in Orlando, Fla., he declared that the laws may &quot;contribute to more violence than they prevent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By allowing and perhaps encouraging violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety,&quot; the nation's top law enforcement officer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starting with Florida in 2005, at least 24 states have adopted some variation of a stand-your-ground law, Buchanan said. Additional states have adopted similar policies through state court rulings. Their general thrust is to remove the long-standing legal &quot;duty to retreat&quot; in the face of danger while in a public place. Instead, individuals may defend themselves, with lethal force if necessary, so long as they are in the public place legally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's attorneys didn't specifically raise the stand-your-ground law as a defense against second-degree murder charges in the February 2012 death of Martin. The trial judge, though, did refer to the &quot;right to stand your ground,&quot; under certain circumstances, in her instructions to the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Holder didn't cite any evidence in support of his assertion about the increased dangers posed by the laws, some exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, two Georgia State University economics researchers concluded that the laws are &quot;associated with a significant increase in the number of homicides among whites, especially white males.&quot; In a 55-page paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, authors Chandler B. McClellan and Erdal Tekin estimated that &quot;between 28 and 33 additional white males are killed each month&quot; as a result of these laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These laws are also associated with a significant increase in emergency room visits and hospital discharges related to firearm-inflicted injuries,&quot; the Georgia State economists said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increased firearm ownership in states with stand-your-ground laws and the presence of bystanders-turned-victims in public places might account for the increased dangers, they suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas A&amp;M researchers Mark Hoekstra and Cheng Cheng reached similar conclusions last year in a 43-page study that found a &quot;statistically significant 8 percent net increase in the number of reported murders and non-negligent manslaughters&quot; in states with the enhanced self-defense laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From an economic perspective, Hoekstra and Cheng reasoned, the laws &quot;reduce the expected cost of using lethal force,&quot; as the chances of civil or criminal liability are lowered. Consequently, the reasoning goes, individuals who are defending themselves are more likely to pull the trigger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases, though, the resulting violence is considered justified. In these cases, advocates say, the laws result in a safer society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private citizens committed 196 justifiable homicides nationwide in 2005, the year states began crafting stand-your-ground laws, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting system. The FBI defines justifiable homicide as &quot;the killing of a felon, during the commission of a felony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 2011, the number of reported justifiable homicides had jumped to 260. In Florida, that number has nearly tripled since the years immediately prior to passage of the self-defense law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, for instance, a 6-foot-4-inch ex-convict named Todd Edward Fryer aggressively approached a man who was sitting in a car in rural Marion County, Fla. The car's driver, 56-year-old Raymond Emala, pulled out a Colt .38 revolver. Fryer tried to hit Emala through the window, law enforcement officials later said, and Emala fired twice, killing Fryer. Three months later, the state attorney's office deemed it a justifiable homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases, the right data is simply hard to find.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Research Council, part of the National Academy of Sciences, cautioned in a 2010 report that it's very difficult to pin down how often a firearm is used defensively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This measurement problem has proved to be quite complex, with some estimates suggesting just over 100,000 defensive gun uses per year and others suggesting 2.5 million or more defensive gun uses per year,&quot; the group noted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 17--The Owensboro chapter of the NAACP will hold a rally Friday evening for people wanting to express their opinions and feelings over last week's verdict in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally will be at 5:30 p.m. Friday at Fifth and Sycamore streets. The event will feature talks by local ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was unarmed when he was fatally shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, during an altercation in Sanford, Fla., in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman reported Martin as suspicious to police but continued to follow Martin, even after 911 dispatchers told him to back off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman fatally shot Martin in some type of altercation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed self-defense and told police he shot Martin because Martin had slammed him to the ground and was beating him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, a Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty of charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal of Friday's rally is not to vent anger about the verdict, NAACP President Evan Taylor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are feelings out there that are for and against the Trayvon verdict,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;Those feelings are neither right or wrong; they just are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministers who will speak at the rally &quot;will focus on the things we have in common,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;We are being responsible in a lot of ways, by providing an opportunity for appropriate venting for the passions that are there, with the hope we can direct&quot; people's emotions in a positive direction, Taylor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Being pissed without purpose is just being pissed,&quot; Taylor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sam Byrd, treasurer for the local NAACP chapter, said people with whom he has spoken have strong feelings about the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The focus (of the rally) is not on the justice system -- the verdict is in,&quot; Byrd said. &quot;What we hope to accomplish is (to show) that we have to believe in justice system, even though it doesn't seem fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have a right to not agree with (the verdict) and to express your disagreement,&quot; Byrd said. &quot;You can protest without destroying property ... A lot of people do not agree and are showing their disagreement. This is the United States of America, and a lot of people fought to have that right disagree in a nondisagreeable way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor said the idea for the rally came from several phone calls he received on Monday about the verdict. Taylor said people have continued to debate the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, one thing that was fervently discussed was that (the belief) that prosecutors lost the case on purpose,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;I've heard criticisms of the all-white jury, the judge, the limitations on the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are many white people who disagree with the verdict,&quot; Taylor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are trying to have a productive message that is positive, (rather than) focus on destruction and blame,&quot; Taylor said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's acquittal was set in motion on February 26, last year, before Martin's body was cold. When Florida police arrived on the scene, they encountered a grown man who acknowledged killing an unarmed 17-year-old boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They did not arrest the man or test him for drug or alcohol use. They conducted a lacklustre search for forensic evidence. They hardly bothered to look for witnesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a national outcry forced authorities to investigate the killing seriously. Even after six weeks, evidence was found to justify arresting Zimmerman, charging him with second-degree murder and putting him on trial. But the chance of establishing what happened that night was lost. The only complete narrative was Zimmerman's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors knew Zimmerman was a self-appointed guardian of the neighbourhood who carried a loaded gun. They were told he profiled Martin - young, black, hooded sweatshirt - as a criminal. They heard he stalked Martin despite the advice of a 911 operator; that the stalking led to a confrontation; and that, as a result, Zimmerman fatally shot Martin in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors knew that Martin was carrying only a bag of sweets and a soft drink. They knew that Martin was walking from a 7-Eleven to his father's girlfriend's house when he saw a man in an SUV following him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To me, and to many who watched the trial, the fact that Zimmerman initiated the tragic encounter was enough to establish, at a minimum, guilt of manslaughter. The six women on the jury disagreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those jurors also knew that Martin, at the time of death, was three weeks past his 17th birthday. But black boys in the US are not allowed to be children. They are assumed to be men and full of menace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know if the jury, which included no African Americans, consciously or unconsciously bought into this racist way of thinking &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; there's really no other word. But it hardly matters, because police and prosecutors initially did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assumption underlying their ho-hum approach was that Zimmerman had the right to self-defence but Martin - young, male, black - did not. The assumption was that Zimmerman would fear for his life in a hand-to-hand struggle but Martin - young, male, black - would not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anyone wonders why African Americans feel so passionately about this case, it's because we know that our 17-year-old sons are boys, not men. It's because we know their adolescent bravado is just that - an imitation, not the real thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know how frightened our sons would be, walking home alone and realising they were being followed. We know how torn they would be between a child's fear and a child's idea of manly behaviour. We know how they would struggle to decide between flight or fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we know that an unarmed skinny boy, no matter how big and bad he tries to seem, does not pose a mortal threat to a man who outweighs him by 50 pounds and has had martial arts training. We know the boy may well have threatened the man's pride, but not his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation we need to have is about why, for example, black men are no more likely than white men to smoke marijuana but nearly four times as likely to be arrested for it - and condemned to a cycle of incarceration and unemployment. I call this racism. What do you call it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin was fighting more than George Zimmerman that night. He was up against prejudices as old as history, and he never had a chance. - Washington Post</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVERY now and then, America generates the perfect media storm. The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was one such, featuring just about every hot-button law-and-order issue you could imagine: guns and neighbourhood vigilantes; self-defence and the right to carry concealed weapons - and, of course, permeating everything, race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out loud, race was barely mentioned during the month-long trial, but it hung over proceedings like a poisonous vapour. History is likely to add the Martin case to a long line stretching from the pre-civil rights era show trials of blacks subjected to Jim Crow justice, through to the acquittal of the Los Angeles police officers in connection with the beating of black motorist Rodney King in 1992, and the ultimate media circus of the OJ Simpson trial two years later. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if the topic of race was not explicitly raised, that was because no one needed to be reminded that had Trayvon&nbsp;Martin been white, his fatal confrontation with George Zimmerman might never have happened. And, of course, had the six-person jury been all black instead of all white, the verdict might well have been different. But not|necessarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difference is that, unlike in the parodies of justice in the segregated South where blacks were automatically convicted if accused of a crime against a white, or in the King and Simpson cases, this time the strictly legal outcome - the acquittal of Zimmerman by his peers - feels right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about the spirit of the law, one may ask, as opposed to its letter? Trials, though, are not morality plays; those who seek such catharsis should go to the theatre, not to a courtroom. On this occasion the law has not been an ass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well before Saturday evening's verdict, impartial expert opinion leant to the view that even if Florida's permissive self-defence laws were removed from the equation, the case for second-degree murder - requiring proof that even if the crime was not premeditated, Zimmerman had displayed evil intent and hatred when he shot Mr Martin - simply was not being made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the judge allowed the prosecution to seek conviction on the lesser charge of manslaughter. But the jury threw that out too. The plain truth is that no one can say for sure what happened on that rainy Sunday evening of February 26, last year in the gated community of Sanford, Florida. There were no witnesses, and it was never established whose voice, whether Zimmerman's or Martin's, was screaming for help in the background of the call to the emergency services. In a criminal court, a defendant's guilt must be shown &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;. Prosecutors failed to clear that fundamental hurdle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given America's multi-tiered legal system, this may not be the end of the affair. Under the criminal law of Florida, Zimmerman has been acquitted. But the Justice Department in Washington faces intense pressure from civil rights groups to bring federal charges against him, under existing hate-crime|legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also possible that the Martin family could seek monetary redress for the loss of their son in civil court, where evidentiary standards are much lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That occurred in the Simpson case. This time, however, there has been no similar travesty of justice, and either course - whether civil or federal - would smack of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The jury has spoken,&quot; President Barack Obama said at the weekend, as he urged calm. And, he could have added, one jury is enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it is, and despite the acquittal, George Zimmerman's life has|probably been changed for ever. He is in hiding, a marked man who is now a target for a hothead's vigilante justice - what he was accused of meting out to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. He will, it appears, get his gun back and, as his lawyer Mark O'Mara drily noted: &quot;There's even more reason now, isn't there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, this case will surely not have the same impact on race relations in the US as the Rodney King case did; still less the 1968 murder of Martin Luther King, when entire cities went up in flames. Yes, there has been heated rhetoric, claims that the bad old days were never truly banished. But the protests and demonstrations in the 24 hours after the verdict was handed down - heartfelt yet almost entirely peaceful - surely tell a more accurate story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin has proved that race is still a factor in national life - but name one country on earth which has a significant racial minority where it is not a factor. Beyond doubt race relations in the US have greatly improved. But there is still much to be done. If it is nonsense to argue that Zimmerman's acquittal proves that the &quot;New South&quot; is as bad as the bigoted old one, it is equally absurd to pretend that, even after the election of a black president, the US has|advanced to sunlit, post-racial uplands. &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama remarked when the case first hit the headlines, 15 months ago. The worries of|minority parents about how their children will be treated by a society whose institutions were forged and still mostly run by whites persist even now, half a century after America's civil rights revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And one final, depressing thought. If the US had sensible gun laws, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would not have died, and no one would have heard of George Zimmerman. Alas, even if you got rid of race in|America, you'd never get rid of guns. - The Independent</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate ends Labor pick filibuster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate voted by the slimmest margin Wednesday to end a filibuster against President Barack Obama's choice to head the Labor Department. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By a 60-40 vote, senators rejected Republican objections and voted to halt delaying tactics aimed at killing Thomas Perez's nomination to become labor secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perez is a top Justice Department official whom Republicans have criticized for his handling of a whistle-blower case against the city of St. Paul, Minn., and for not heeding a congressional subpoena that sought his personal emails in that case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans voting to end the Perez filibuster were Sens. John McCain of Arizona, an architect of this week's deal, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heading off a costly increase for returning college students, a bipartisan group of senators reached a deal Wednesday that would offer students better rates on their loans this fall but perhaps assign higher rates in coming years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal would offer students lower interest rates through the 2015 academic year, but then rates were expected to climb above where they were when students left campus this spring. The interest rates would be linked to the financial markets, but Democrats won a protection for students that rates would never climb higher than 8.25 percent for undergraduate students. Graduate students would not pay rates higher than 9.5 percent and parents' rates would top out at 10.5percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the deal, all undergraduates this fall would borrow at 3.85percent interest rates. Graduate students would have access to loans at 5.4percent and parents would be able to borrow at 6.4 percent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some looked at murder trial witness Rachel Jeantel and saw either a defiant young woman or a victim, Tom Joyner looked at her and saw potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nationally syndicated radio personality and philanthropist says he was touched by Jeantel, who spent two days testifying in the trial of George Zimmerman about her last conversation with her friend Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Joyner was so moved that he has offered to pay for Jeantel to attend the historically black college of her choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained the offer in an open letter to Jeantel and &quot;all the young people in this country who, through no fault of their own, find yourself living in underserved communities and not yet figuring out your way in this world.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Now, jurors will decide whether the 76-year-old defendant was mentally ill at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury deliberated for about an hour before finding John Henry Spooner guilty of first-degree intentional homicide.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Tuesday morning, 1 million people had signed an NAACP petition asking the Department of Justice to pursue federal and civil rights charges against George Zimmerman after he was found not guilty in the murder of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I knew I was not alone in my outrage, anger and heartbreak over this decision. When a teenager's life is taken, and there is no accountability for the man who killed him, nothing seems right in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we cannot let these emotions rule us. Instead, in these most challenging of times, we are called to act. That begins with the pursuit of justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, and it continues with a comprehensive campaign to fight the underlying factors that led to his death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step is clear: We must make sure that George Zimmerman is held accountable for his actions. The jury's decision must be respected and the rule of law upheld, but that does not mean the investigation should be considered complete. The trial judge's decision to discount debate about race or racial profiling in the courtroom leaves open questions about Zimmerman's motivation and intent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Justice has the power to investigate whether Zimmerman's actions constitute a hate crime under federal law. The department has closely monitored the case since March, and only put its investigation on hold to respect the state's trial. Since the verdict and the overwhelming response, Attorney General Eric Holder has agreed to reopen his investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he told the Delta Sigma Theta convention this week, &quot;We are determined to meet division and confusion with understanding and compassion   and also with truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the power of a million voices. One voice in angry protest can be ignored, but when 1 million people speak as one   and thousands more take to the street in peaceful protest, rallies and vigils   we can change the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what comes next? As we closely follow the Department of Justice's investigation, we must continue to draw on our collective outrage and refuse to let the memory of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin fade from the hearts and minds of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death did not occur in a vacuum. Ours was supposed to be the first generation of black Americans to be judged not by our race or the color of our skin. Instead, we find ourselves to be the most murdered generation in the country and the most incarcerated on the planet. Meanwhile, racial profiling continues to rear its ugly head in law enforcement and civilian life alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have a chance to address some of these societal ills. We have a chance to challenge racial profiling in all its forms, and to fight the underlying cause of violence in our communities, by the good guys and bad guys alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This last year we have already changed the world. Not a single state in the continental United States passed a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law in 2013   the first time in eight years. And last month the New York City Council passed a strong bill banning the racially abusive practice of &quot;stop and frisk&quot; policing, after hundreds of thousands of people protested in the name of Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have a choice. We can be felled by our sorrow over the jury's decision. Or we can turn our frustration into action. We will demand the Department of Justice address the travesties of this tragedy. We will advance our movement to end racial profiling in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with 1 million people at our back, we will make sure the memory of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin never fades. Sign the NAACP's petition atwww.naacp.org .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, a new twist to the George Zimmerman trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The unthinkable&quot; verdict of Zimmerman not being guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanford police chief didn't want to charge him because of lack of evidence, the county district attorney didn't want to charge him for lack of evidence. So the state DA stepped in from much pressure from above and with what seemed like much delight, charged him with second degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was found not guilty of all charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Were they surprised?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This travesty could not have happened without the help of a biased media and two racists named Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton. In the beginning they fanned the flames of unrest with their claims of white on black racism. At the end they called for peace and not violence. Look at me in the beginning and look at me at the end. A win-win for Jackson and Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they weren't so busy spreading hatred to their &quot;sheep,&quot; they might have to go out and get a job like the rest of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Schriver<BR>Salinas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outrage spurred investigation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's remember why the Trayvon Martin murder case was so important. Our current laws find a dead black teenager of so little value that no investigation of his death would have taken place if people hadn't spoken out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This took 44 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This teenager was casually walking home   &quot;meandering,&quot; as my mother used to call it   talking with a friend when a creepy guy begins following him. Minutes later this teen was shot in the heart. All that love, pride, care, future and hope of his parents, bleeding out on the ground. All the pain settling in to haunt them the remainder of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can't bear to think of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you believe this same slow-to-justice scenario would have occurred with a white teen, you're not facing reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, we've made many strides, but there are many still to come.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make a fire museum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A solution for the Museum of Monterey is to utilize the building as a fire museum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The museum would house, at no cost, all the historical antique fire apparatus, equipment and photographs that are now stored throughout the cities of Monterey, Pacific Grove and Carmel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fire department was the social club of the Monterey Peninsula, and its members consisted of some of the most prominent individuals who lived here. Many of these individuals were influential in making the Peninsula the destination spot it has become, but a majority of the locals and tourists are not aware of the real history of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fire museum will attract many visitors as it is unique to the local area and a place parents will take their children   after all, children like fire engines. The museum would be a place where school children could learn the history of the fire departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to preserve the history for future generations or we will lose it over time.</SPAN></P>

What we need in the Alisal is more single family homes with a backyard where children can safely play. We have hundreds of apartments with no recreation area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been much talk about the future growth area, but not enough on how we can redevelop blighted neighborhoods where people live. Realizing it is more expensive to redevelop than to develop, we need to fix what we currently have and not let it get worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alisal is a strong financial hub, but it is known more for the &quot;bad side of town.&quot; Most of our workforce in the hospitality Industry for the Monterey Peninsula and the farmworkers for the Salinas Valley that produce the $6 billion agriculture industry live here. These are hardworking people wanting to improve the quality of life for themselves and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I encourage you to stand together with the Acosta Plaza Homeowners Association in advocating for Parks and Recreation to improve their neighborhood because improvements made here in this densely populated neighborhood will have a positive ripple effect in the entire city of Salinas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE of six women jurors who cleared George Zimmerman of murdering unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin has scrapped plans for a book about the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It came as US Attorney-General Eric Holder called today for a rethink of stand-your-ground laws, telling the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People: ``We must stand our ground . . . it's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defence and sow dangerous conflict in our neighbourhoods.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woman juror B-37 said she had been shielded from public ``pain'' about the racially-charged case as a juror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I realise it was necessary for our jury to be sequestered to protect our verdict from unfair outside influence but that isolation shielded me from the depth of pain that exists among the general public over every aspect of this case,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book and return instead to my life as it was before.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B-37 earlier told CNN details of deliberations before the Florida jury issued its verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the jury of five white women and one Hispanic woman was evenly split when deliberations began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We had three not guilties, one second degree murder and two manslaughters,'' said the juror, adding she voted not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``It was just so confusing with what and what we could apply to what. Because I mean, there was a couple of them in there that wanted to find him guilty of something,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``After hours of deliberating the law and reading it over and over, we decided there's just no way.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Mar tin is dead, George Zimmerman has been acquitted and millions of people are outraged. Some politicians are demanding a second prosecution of Zimmerman, this time for hate crimes. Others are blaming the tragedy on &quot;Stand your Ground&quot; laws, which they insist must be repealed. Many who saw the case as proof of racism in the u.S. criminal justice system see the verdict as further confirmation. everywhere you look, people feel vindicated in their bitter assumptions. They want action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's how Martin ended up dead. It's how Zimmerman ended up with a bulletproof vest he might have to wear for the rest of his life. It's how activists and the media embarrassed themselves with bogus reports. The problem at the core of this case wasn't race or guns. The problem was assumption, misperception and overreaction. And that cycle hasn't ended with the verdict. It has escalated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I almost joined the frenzy. yesterday I was going to write that Zimmerman pursued Martin against police instructions and illustrated the perils of racial profiling. But I hadn't followed the case in detail. So I sat down and watched the closing arguments: nearly seven hours of video in which the prosecution and defence went point by point through the evidence as it had been hashed out at the trial. Based on what I learned from the videos, I did some further reading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It turned out I had been wrong about many things. The initial portrait of Zimmerman as a racist wasn't just exaggerated. It was completely unsubstantiated. It's a case study in how the same kind of bias that causes racism can cause unwarranted allegations of racism. Some of the people Zimmerman had reported as suspicious were black men, so he was a racist. Members of his family seemed racist, so he was a racist. everybody knew he was a racist, so his recorded words were misheard as racial slurs, proving again that he was a racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 911 dispatcher who spoke to Zimmerman on the fatal night didn't tell him to stay in his car. Zimmerman said he was following a suspicious person, and the dispatcher told him, &quot;We don't need you to do that.&quot; Chief prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda conceded in his closing argument that these words were ambiguous. de la Rionda also acknowledged, based on witness and forensic evidence, that both men &quot;were scraping and rolling and fighting out there.&quot; He pointed out that the wounds, blood evidence, and dNA didn't match Zimmerman's story of being thoroughly restrained and pummeled throughout the fight. But the evidence didn't fit the portrait of Martin as a sweet-tempered child, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the notion that Zimmerman hunted down Martin to accost him made no sense. Zimmerman knew the police were on the way. They arrived only a minute or so after the gunshot. The fight happened in a public area surrounded by townhouses at close range. It was hardly the place or time to start shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't make Zimmerman a hero. It just makes him a reckless fool instead of a murderer. In a post-verdict press conference, his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, claimed that &quot;the evidence supported that George Zimmerman did nothing wrong,&quot; that &quot;the jury decided that he acted properly in self-defence,&quot; and that Zimmerman &quot;was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defence. I'm glad that the jury saw it that way.&quot; That's complete BS. The only thing the jury decided was that there was reasonable doubt as to whether Zimmerman had committed seconddegree murder or manslaughter. Zimmerman is guilty, morally if not legally, of precipitating the confrontation that led to Martin's death. He did many things wrong. Mistake No. 1 was inferring that Martin was a burglar. In his 911 call, Zimmerman cited Martin's behaviour. &quot;It's raining, and he's just walking around&quot; looking at houses, Zimmerman said. He warned the dispatcher, &quot;He's got his hand in his waistband.&quot; He described Martin's race and clothing only after the dispatcher asked about them. Whatever its basis, the inference was false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mistake No. 2 was pursuing Martin on foot. Zimmerman had already done what the neighbourhood watch rules advised: He had called the police. They would have arrived, questioned Martin and ascertained that he was innocent. Instead, Zimmerman, packing a concealed firearm, got out and started walking after Martin. Zimmerman's initial story, that he was trying to check the name of the street, was so laughable that his attorneys abandoned it. He was afraid Martin would get away. So he followed Martin, hoping to update the cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mistake No. 3 was Zimmerman's utter failure to imagine how his behaviour looked to Martin. you're a black kid walking home from a convenience store with Skittles and a fruit drink. Some dude in a car is watching and trailing you. God knows what he wants. you run away. He gets out of the car and follows you. What are you supposed to do? In Zimmerman's initial interrogation, the police expressed surprise that he hadn't identified himself to Martin as a neighbourhood watch volunteer. They suggested that Martin might have been alarmed when Zimmerman reached for an object that Zimmerman, but not Martin, knew was a phone. Zimmerman seemed baffled. He was so convinced of Martin's criminal intent that he hadn't considered how Martin, if he were innocent, would perceive his stalker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin , meanwhile , was profiling Zimmerman. On his phone, he told a friend he was being followed by a &quot;creepy-ass cracker.&quot; The friend - who later testified that this phrase meant pervert - advised Martin, &quot;you better run.&quot; She reported, as Zimmerman did, that Martin challenged Zimmerman, demanding to know why he was being hassled. If Zimmerman's phobic misreading of Martin was the first wrong turn that led to their fatal struggle, Martin's phobic misreading of Zimmerman may have been the second. In court, evidence and scrutiny have exposed these difficult, complicated truths. But outside the court, ideologues are ignoring them. They're oversimplifying a tragedy that was caused by oversimplification. Martin has become emmett Till. New york Mayor Michael Bloomberg is using the verdict to attack Florida's &quot;Stand your Ground&quot; law, which wasn't invoked in this case. The grievance industrial complex is pushing the department of Justice to prosecute Zimmerman for bias-motivated killing, based on evidence that didn't even support a conviction for unpremeditated killing. Zimmerman's lawyers have teamed up with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, inadvertently, to promote the false message that Zimmerman's acquittal means our society thinks everything he did was OK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't OK. It was stupid and dangerous. It led to the unnecessary death of an innocent young man. It happened because two people - their minds clouded by stereotypes that went well beyond race - assumed the worst about one another and acted in haste. If you want to prevent the next Trayvon&nbsp;Martin tragedy, learn from their mistakes. don't paint the world in black and white. don't declare the whole justice system racist, or blame every gun death on guns, or confuse acquittal with vindication. And the next time you see somebody who looks like a punk or a pervert, hold your fire.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. attorney-general Eric Holder has now decided to focus further attention on the tragedy of black teenager Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot by community guard George Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been suggested that Mr. Holder and his department of Justice (dOJ) would be far better employed if, for example, they paid significant attention to the rash of deaths over the July 4 weekend. One headline has: &quot;deadly July 4 Weekend in Chicago: 9 Killed, 55 Injured.&quot; The story goes on to record that the &quot;littlest victims&quot; were boys of five and seven. This was just in Chicago, where the death toll for the year reached 200.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It does not take too much common sense to realize that tragic as it was, the Zimmerman/Martin case is a single case out of a multitude of others. Mr. Holder and the dOJ should process this logic and concentrate their efforts where they might achieve more widespread and lasting benefit, including the current mob violence. That may get Mr. Holder less recognition from his community, but would be much more useful. David Hogg, Toronto.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. attorney-general eric Holder has now decided to focus further attention on the tragedy of black teenager Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot by community guard George Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been suggested that Mr. Holder and his department of Justice (dOJ) would be far better employed if, for example, they paid significant attention to the rash of deaths over the July 4 weekend. One headline has: &quot;deadly July 4 Weekend in Chicago: 9 Killed, 55 Injured.&quot; The story goes on to record that the &quot;littlest victims&quot; were boys of five and seven. This was just in Chicago, where the death toll for the year reached 200.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It does not take too much common sense to realize that tragic as it was, the Zimmerman/Martin case is a single case out of a multitude of others. Mr. Holder and the dOJ should process this logic and concentrate their efforts where they might achieve more widespread and lasting benefit, including the current mob violence. That may get Mr. Holder less recognition from his community, but would be much more useful. David Hogg, Toronto.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesting the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin, Stevie Wonder said on Sunday that he will not play a concert in Florida until the state repeals its Stand Your Ground law, which makes it harder to prosecute people who claim they killed someone in self-defense, NBC reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I decided today that until the Stand Your Ground law is abolished in Florida I will never perform there again,'' Mr. Wonder said during a concert in Quebec City. ''Wherever I find that law exists I will not perform in that state or that part of the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial focused attention on Florida's expansive self-defense law, and its Stand Your Ground provision. That provision allows people to use lethal force to defend themselves if they ''reasonably believe'' they might be killed or suffer severe injuries, even if they can retreat from the conflict, setting a low bar that makes prosecuting such cases difficult. About two dozen states have similar laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like almost everything else in the trial of Mr. Zimmerman, the role of the Stand Your Ground provision in the jury's decision to acquit him is unclear. Mr. Zimmerman's defense did not invoke the provision, arguing instead that he could not have retreated from the fight on the night of Feb. 26, 2012, because Mr. Martin had pinned him to the ground and was hitting him. Still, the judge specifically mentioned the provision when she gave the jury its instructions, so it may have been a factor in the jury's deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many people upset about the outcome of the trial, however, the provision has become a focus of anger. Some argue that such laws, coupled with gun laws allowing citizens to carry concealed guns, encourage the kind of confrontations that led to Mr. Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wonder is one of them. ''For those that we have lost in the battle for justice, wherever that fits in any part of the world, we can't bring them back, what we can do is we can let our voices be heard,'' he said. He added: ''You can't just talk about it. You got to be about it.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirteen years ago, on the first season of the CBS reality competition ''Big Brother,'' one houseguest was William Collins, also known as Will Mega, an intensely political black man who proved polarizing in the house for his sometimes confrontational talk about race. It was a novelty, this sort of conversation, in network prime time, and in the eyes of Americans, perhaps not a welcome one: the audience voted Mr. Collins off the show first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the years since, ''Big Brother'' casts have displayed token diversity, but rarely has race been a subject of conversation, partly because of the producers' apparent belief that it will arise only when members of a minority group are present and vocal, a scenario they've largely avoided. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This season, though, race has become the dominant narrative thanks to a handful of white cast members who've turned the show, which runs three nights a week, into a rare opportunity to watch white privilege and unconscious racism in the field. It may be occurring in a sealed-off space, but it's feasting on the oxygen of national network television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's episode was the most disturbing of the season so far. Aaryn Gries, a young white woman, flipped the mattress of Candice Stewart, one of the show's black cast members, then taunted Ms. Stewart with an exaggerated, stereotypical voice: ''What you gon' do, girl?'' and ''Where's yo class, girl?'' She was soon backed up by another white cast member, GinaMarie Zimmerman, who screamed at Ms. Stewart, ''You want the black to come out?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is execrable stuff by any measurement. The bullying is childish, but that's standard on ''Big Brother.'' It's the unchecked race privilege -- the belief in the normative nature of whiteness, leading to blithe intolerance like that expressed by Ms. Gries -- that is nauseating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later on Sunday, Ms. Stewart cried in the arms of Howard Overby, the other black cast member, and detailed other aggressions that had been directed her way, including being called ''Shaniqua.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race is also encoded into conversations in more subtle, slippery ways. When a player is described as ''strong'' by other houseguests, almost invariably that player is one of the white, conventionally popular cast members. On Sunday's episode, Ms. Gries complained that the housemates had teamed up against her. ''They've come to the conclusion that they want to pick off all the strong players, just keep picking off the strongest players until the weakest person wins,'' she griped, as if picking off players, strong or otherwise, weren't part of savvy game play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not a surprise that the alliance that has targeted Ms. Gries and her comrades includes most of the minority group members -- Helen Kim, who is Asian-American, and Andy Herren, who is gay. (Mr. Overby, a deeply religious youth counselor, has proved a more complicated player, and Jeremy McGuire, who is part Cherokee, is aligned with Ms. Gries.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operative conceit of ''Big Brother'' is the hermetic seal, both of the house itself, which is cut off from the outside world in all meaningful ways, and of the show, which turns nonactors into characters, and theoretically affords them an opportunity to present a self that is different from the one they display in their normal lives. Living in the house must feel like a safe space for those who are prejudiced. Possibly they forget that they are under constant surveillance, and come to believe that their worst behaviors might stay locked up inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But shows like this aggressively seek story lines rooted in conflict. After revelations about the irresponsible comments made by Ms. Gries and others, the producers were criticized for not including them in the show. (The offensive behavior was first noticed and detailed by fans who obsessively monitor and document -- on blogs and Twitter -- the live Internet feeds of the house, which are available for a fee.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a couple of recent episodes the comments were highlighted in the context of demonstrating how they affected Ms. Gries's game play. But by Sunday's episode her intolerance had become her narrative. Amanda Zuckerman, another houseguest, told her that she was ''racist on this show, O.K., and when you get out of this house, you're gonna have a lot of people'' -- here, she added a profanity -- ''hating you.'' (Ms. Gries has already lost a modeling contract because of her actions, although she has not been informed.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, for the first time, the show opened with a disclaimer noting that ''the houseguests may reveal prejudices and other beliefs that CBS does not condone.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly ''Big Brother'' is in the business of broadcasting regular peeks into the actual experience of racism. While it might not be brave, it is revelatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reality television has occasionally floated into this territory before -- think of the fight between Kevin Powell and Julie Gentry in the first season of MTV's ''Real World'' about race in America, or the callous prejudice of Colton Cumbie on ''Survivor: One World.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the tensions in the ''Big Brother'' house are continuing, and seemingly increasing. This conflagration is unfolding at a tense moment in American race relations, coming after the not-guilty verdict in the killing of Trayvon Martin. On Monday Anderson Cooper interviewed a juror in the trial, and it was hard not to hear similarities between the comments of that woman, whose opinions appeared to be rooted in a lack of diverse cultural exposure, and the galling opinions expressed by Ms. Gries and other ''Big Brother'' contestants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racism flourishes in the shadows, where accountability is nil, but ''Big Brother'' is becoming a laboratory experiment in what happens when it is instead blatant and overt. Ms. Gries is eligible for elimination by her housemates this week -- nominated by Ms. Kim -- but she may survive. Certainly it will be a huge problem for CBS and ''Big Brother'' producers should Ms. Gries continue on the show, or even go on to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That seems unlikely, though. On Sunday night she listed the people in the house she felt she could trust, then concluded, ''We are the minority.'' She didn't look happy about it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES -- The police here were preparing for another night of protests on Tuesday, and community activists were working to maintain the peace after anger over the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin turned violent in South Los Angeles on Monday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of about 150 mostly young people broke away from a peaceful demonstration on Monday in the Crenshaw district, long home to many of the city's black residents. Protesters ran through the streets, blocking traffic, hitting cars, assaulting pedestrians and ransacking businesses, the police reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of police officers in riot gear descended on the area to quell the unrest. Fourteen people were arrested, the police said, half of them juveniles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two decades after the acquittal of white Los Angeles police officers in the beating of Rodney King sparked deadly riots in the same part of the city, residents and public officials agreed that the more muted anger over the Zimmerman verdict -- and the much smaller outbreak of violence -- showed how much, and how little, has changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Twenty-one years ago we witnessed what could happen when there's a reaction to a verdict,'' Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles County supervisor who represents South Los Angeles, said at a news conference on Monday night. ''Similar sentiments are being expressed here in this space, but the response of the L.A.P.D. is qualitatively different.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in the neighborhood, while remaining wary of law enforcement officials, agreed that relations between black residents and the Police Department had vastly improved. The police allowed the demonstration to continue until the violence began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The police did a top-notch job,'' said Trebien Bellows, 46, a lifelong neighborhood resident. ''Before things got crazy, they jumped right on it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite his praise for the police, Mr. Bellows said he understood the frustration expressed by the group that broke away from the protest in outrage. Young black people continue to be perceived as threats and targeted by the police, he said, and the Zimmerman case showed how they often paid with their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What happened after the peaceful protest was basically just kids lashing out,'' he said. ''Young African-American and Latino kids, they're the ones being targeted.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darnell M. Hunt, a sociology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studied the 1992 riots, said that five years after the election of the country's first black president, race relations are at a critical point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Barack Obama was elected, he said, crowds gathered in Leimert Park to celebrate. ''They really did see it as a new day in terms of race, and most importantly for black youth, who for generations never seriously thought they could become president,'' Dr. Hunt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the same community is protesting instead of celebrating. ''People were hoping their view of justice would be served, and it wasn't,'' Dr. Hunt said. ''They're having a hard time believing in the American dream and the idea that African-Americans had finally become full-fledged citizens.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., in a speech Tuesday at the N.A.A.C.P. convention in Orlando, Fla., condemned Florida's Stand Your Ground law. ''It's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unrest in Los Angeles followed consecutive nights of largely peaceful protests in cities like Atlanta, Chicago, New York and Washington. In Oakland, Calif., demonstrators blocked traffic along Interstate 880 for a brief period during the afternoon rush Monday before authorities cleared the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters made varied demands. Some wanted the federal government to prosecute Mr. Zimmerman. Others hoped for an overhaul of the entire American justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is much bigger than just this one trial,'' said Oriana Sly, 20, of Los Angeles. She carried a sign that read ''Justice for Trayvon'' as she marched up Crenshaw Boulevard here on Sunday night. ''People of color have not received our fair share with the American justice system.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday night, however, some protesters' frustration boiled over. They stormed a Walmart and other stores. They ran through the streets, blocking traffic and jumping on stopped cars, kicking them and dancing on the hoods. A television news crew was attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the city's new mayor, Eric Garcetti, called for calm on the streets on Tuesday, he acknowledged the echoes from the Rodney King riots, but insisted the city had come a long way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is a different moment in time; we can see how much change for the better the city has enjoyed since 1992,'' Mr. Garcetti said. ''For somebody born after 1992, they just see the world the way it is before them. I think the importance of seeing this through the youth's eyes is to see what's left undone.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Our work isn't finished here,'' he added. ''It wasn't finished in 1965. It wasn't finished in 1992. It is not finished in 2013.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anthony Weiner has come under intense fire from Jewish leaders for &shy;invoking Nazi Germany while criticizing the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Last year, more than 700,000 in New York were stopped - the overwhelming majority of them were young men of color. Ninety-seven percent of them did nothing wrong,&quot; Weiner told largely black congregants in Staten Island's First Central Baptist Church Sunday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;And the mayor stood up and said, 'Wait a minute, statistically this' and 'statistically that.' Well, you can have 100 percent statistical reduction in crime if you stop everybody. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;You could have 1938 Germany, because everyone has to show their papers.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State Sen. Simcha Felder, who represents largely &shy;Orthodox communities in South Brooklyn, slammed Weiner's remarks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;His comments were shocking and disgraceful . . . [and] he should apologize,&quot; Felder declared. &quot;Anyone who uses the Holocaust frivolously diminishes the tragedy that occurred. Weiner clearly stepped over the line.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Weiner made the comments a day after the controversial acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Weiner campaign yesterday sought to clarify the explosive comments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The context of the reference was the argument made by some that stopping innocent citizens was an &shy;acceptable cost for public safety,&quot; said Weiner spokeswoman Barbara Morgan. &quot;He clearly was not equating 1938 Nazi Germany to New York City.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The latest Quinnipiac University Democratic mayoral poll shows Weiner on top with 25 percent, followed by Christine Quinn with 22 percent. But Weiner pulls 20 percent of the Jewish vote, more than any other candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The controversial Nazi comment comes as the Democratic candidates jockey to appeal to voters critical of stop-and-frisk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As City Council speaker, Quinn championed a bill that creates an NYPD inspector general to monitor stop-and-frisk. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The verdict is in on the George Zimmerman trial and it's &quot;not guilty&quot; (&quot;Zimmerman's Acquittal,&quot; Editorial, July 15).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But many of the cable TV news stations, especially CNN and HLN, don't necessarily agree with the court's decision and continue to stir up dissent days after the trial has ended.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All of these people who don't agree with the court's decision are the same ones who, in 1995, applauded and cheered for O.J. Simpson when he was declared not guilty in his murder trial.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If an individual defends himself against a black assailant, he's racist. If authorities refuse to prosecute because there's no case, mobs will take to the streets demanding &quot;justice.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If jurors affirm what the authorities knew, that there is no case, they will be called racists, at which point mobs will take to the street demanding a do-over in federal court. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An armed man confronts an unarmed man. The unarmed man has gone to the store for a snack. The armed man may be looking for trouble. It cannot be known what, if anything, the armed man says or yells, but guns speak louder than words.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So the unarmed man stands his ground and goes for the armed man as if it's his only chance to survive, which it is.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The unarmed man is dead. The armed man is found not guilty. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In all of the coverage I've seen so far, and in all of the racial rhetoric, no one seems to be asking the most obvious question to ask in a case of self-defense: Who threw the first punch?  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I've read and heard numerous times in the liberal media that Zimmerman &quot;profiled&quot; Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as someone who might be involved in criminal activity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Isn't that exactly what anyone involved in a neighborhood watch program is supposed to do? Then one would call 911, right?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He continued to follow Martin, which led to Martin confronting and assaulting the &quot;crazy-ass cracker&quot; following him.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Had Zimmerman stayed in his car, this wouldn't have happened. But it's not clear the 911 dispatcher who told him to stay in his car had police authority.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Had Martin gone home, this wouldn't have happened. Instead, he assaulted Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman was looking for a troublemaker. Martin, once he noticed Zimmerman, was looking for trouble.  </SPAN></P>

Jack Roepnack </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Poland, NY </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Is there not irony in Attorney General Eric Holder - who claims that he and President Obama have a right to assassinate American citizens overseas and even domestically if they thought national security so required - potentially investigating Zimmerman's claim of self-defense?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Edward Hochman </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Manhattan </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Zimmerman had been dark-skinned, this whole absurd media brouhaha would never have occurred.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yes, it's sad that a youth - often referred to as &quot;a child,&quot; which is misleading - has been killed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a jury found Zimmerman not guilty of the charges filed against him and people should accept that, even though they might not like it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I wish there would be more outrage and demonstrations when inner-city black kids are shot, not by &quot;white Hispanics,&quot; but by fellow blacks. Melanie Coronetz </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They told us - over and over and over - that the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin spectacle was a racial parable for our times. They forgot to tell the jury.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;All of us thought race did not play a role,&quot; said the only juror to speak. Her identity concealed, she told CNN that race never came up during more than 16 hours of deliberations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Prosecutors didn't go there, either, trying to make the case that Zimmerman had no reason to fire his gun in self-defense. They never alleged a racial component. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They couldn't, because there was no evidence to support it. The police department's chief investigator testified that he believed Zimmerman's account that he was attacked and feared for his life. FBI agents interviewed more than 30 people and found no evidence of racial bias.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The unanimous &quot;not guilty'' verdict should spark soul-searching from those who claim Martin was killed because he was black.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It should, but it won't. Too many people see stirring the racial pot as good business.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It keeps the hustlers in the headlines and gives predominately white news organizations a way to expiate their guilt.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Remember how all this racializing was going to stop when we got a black president?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It turns out that a postracial presidency was just another false promise. Barack Obama actually fanned the flames for votes, saying during last year's campaign, &quot;If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Subtle he's not. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nor can you expect change when the first black attorney general, Eric Holder, links the case to the civil-rights era. His smear of the jury system turns a criminal case into another political football. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  America is better than that, even if they are not. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Photo: Getty Images)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I moved to Boston after college to find my birthfather. My sole black parent, who, I'd been told, used to spend a lot of time hanging around the Berklee School of Music-not as a student, or a teacher, or any kind of staff member, just as a guy who loved jazz music, could play the guitar some (and well enough to woo young women, my white birthmother among them), and who knew that there was no chance in hell of him ever becoming a professional musician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I found a cheap studio apartment a few blocks from the Berklee School, and soon thereafter started an internship at Blackside Productions, the film and television production company founded by the late Henry Hampton that produced the landmark Civil Rights series </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Eyes on the Prize</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. I worked as a research assistant to help with a documentary called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Malcolm X: Make it Plain</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It was summertime and it was hot, and the Blackside offices were on Shawmut Avenue, right on the border of the South End and Roxbury, an area that used to be far more &quot;urban&quot; than it is now. Having grown up in rural New Hampshire, and gone to college in bucolic Western Massachusetts, the neighborhood felt deep, loud and legit to me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would take the bus or walk to my internship, pass a barbershop on Mass Ave where a lot of really cute young black men work (one of them later became my boyfriend), pass Bob's famous Southern food joint on Columbus Ave., sweat a bunch, and find my way to the Blackside headquarters, where I would sit in a small conference room, and listen to old audio-taped speeches by Malcolm X. Obviously, I knew who Malcolm X was-but despite having majored in black literature, founding a black student union, and standing in line to see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Do the Right Thing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the day it opened-I don't believe I had ever experienced live footage of a Malcolm X speech, certainly not in its entirety. And there was something about sitting in that cool, dark room, alone at a long, bare table, with a recorder and headphones and hearing his voice boom, crackly but resonant, straight into my ear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That voice-the timbre, the power and cadence-it nearly gutted me, brought me to tears. The thunderous, exacting conviction, the elegant way he made words out of injustice and anger, all while intoning this overwhelming sense of love-love for black people, for his people, love for freedom, intellect, livelihood. I suddenly missed him terribly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the evenings I would walk home to my little studio, Malcolm's voice clear and big in my head as I searched the sidewalks for a man who might look like me, who was likely very average, probably nothing like Malcolm at all. But just as important to me. My birthfather, from what I knew then and now, grew up largely in foster homes and government institutions in parts of the south and Boston, after his mother (who may or may not have been Blanche Calloway, sister of Cab) abandoned him at a very young age. He worked various odd jobs throughout his life, but loved music the most and got by a good deal on his looks. And then he fell in love with my birthmother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I didn't find him until a couple of years later. He was hurting. Disheveled. Proud. He was a grown black man, who hadn't mattered enough as a young black boy. Like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I followed the Zimmerman trial-not as closely as many, but close enough to watch Trayvon's friend be demoralized, and to witness the stoicism of Trayvon's heartbroken parents. I also saw the photograph of dead Trayvon that circulated the Internet just a few days ago; young, stiff, life-all-out-of-him Trayvon. White sneakers, jeans, the hoodie, lying on the ground-cold brown skin, his untended body, his unbeating heart. When the verdict of Zimmerman's acquittal was announced, I felt sad, but what I really felt was that I wished he had mattered more to America, which is what I wished for my birthfather when I met him. And that I missed this boy, Trayvon, without ever having known him, in the same way I had missed Malcolm X with my headphones on and his voice reaching through my ears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I moved to Boston after college to find my birthfather. What I found then, and realized only now, was the way in which I identify with and experience black culture and blackness. When one of us is hurting, or killed, I care so much. So very much.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US Attorney General Eric Holder has called for a rethink of &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; laws following the acquittal of a neighbourhood watch volunteer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Holder acknowledged the passions stirred by the racially-tinged trial of George Zimmerman, found not guilty on Saturday of murdering Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Separate and apart from the case that has drawn the nation&quot;s attention, it&quot;s time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighbourhoods,&quot; Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These laws try to fix something that was never broken. There has always been a legal defence for using deadly force if -- and the &quot;if&quot; is important -- no safe retreat is available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s trial lawyers did not explicitly invoke Florida&quot;s stand-your-ground law, arguing instead that he acted in self-defence in a confrontation with Martin in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the case has stirred up controversy around such laws, which assert that citizens can use lethal force if they feel their lives are threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By allowing and perhaps encouraging violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety. The list of resulting tragedies is long and - unfortunately - has victimised too many who are innocent,&quot; Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our collective obligation - we must stand our ground - to ensure that our laws reduce violence, and take a hard look at laws that contribute to more violence than they prevent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of the verdict from the six-woman and mostly white jury argue that Zimmerman had racially profiled Martin -- who had no criminal record -- and was able to kill him with impunity because of a biased criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder, who spoke at the NAACP national meeting in Orlando, Florida, not far from where Martin died, remained non-committal on whether the Justice Department might pursue Zimmerman on civil rights grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Justice Department has an open investigation&quot; into the case, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While that inquiry is ongoing, I can promise that the Department of Justice will consider all available information before determining what action to take.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI (AP) Civil rights leaders are planning vigils and rallies in 100 U.S. cities this weekend to press the federal government to bring charges against a former-neighborhood watch volunteer acquitted in the killing of an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman had been charged with second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin last year, but a jury of six women found him not guilty of that charge as well as the lesser charge of manslaughter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People all across the country will gather to show that we are not having a two- or three-day anger fit. This is a social movement for justice,&quot; Rev. Al Sharpton said Tuesday as he announced the plan outside the Justice Department in Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rallies and vigils will occur in front of federal court buildings at noon Saturday in cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was visiting his father and returning to the home of his father&quot;s fiance in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, after a trip to the store when Zimmerman identified him as a potential criminal. The neighborhood watchman fatally shot Martin during a physical confrontation in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was black, and Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic. Zimmerman was not arrested for 44 days, and the delay in charging him led to nationwide protests from those who believed race was a factor in the handling of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton says vigils will be followed by a conference next week in Miami to develop a plan to address Florida&quot;s &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; law. The law gives people wide latitude to use deadly force if they fear death or bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said such laws, which exist in many states, need to be reassessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Separate and apart from the case that has drawn the nation&quot;s attention, it&quot;s time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods,&quot; Holder said during a speech before a convention of the NAACP civil rights group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, protests over Zimmerman&quot;s acquittal have broken out as far away as California, where rallies were small and calm Tuesday night. In Los Angeles, police had vowed to crack down with quick action to prevent a recurrence of the vandalism and violence the city saw on Monday night in street protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department has said it is looking into Martin&quot;s death to determine whether federal prosecutors will file criminal civil rights charges against Zimmerman, who is now a free man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key to charging Zimmerman lies in whether evidence exists that he was motivated by racial animosity to kill Martin. While Martin&quot;s family has said the teen was racially profiled, no evidence surfaced during the state trial that Zimmerman had a racial bias. Zimmerman maintained he acted in self-defense. He claimed Martin was slamming his head into the concrete sidewalk when he fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s friends and family have repeatedly denied he harbored racial animosity toward blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the jurors in the case known only as Juror B37 because their identities have not been released said in an interview with CNN&quot;s Anderson Cooper Monday that she did not believe Zimmerman followed Martin because of his race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 said the actions of Zimmerman and Martin both led to the teenager&quot;s fatal shooting last year, but that Zimmerman didn&quot;t actually break the law. She said Zimmerman made some mistakes, but that she believed Martin struck Zimmerman first and that the neighborhood watch volunteer had a right to defend himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 said the jurors were initially divided on Zimmerman&quot;s guilt, with three jurors believing he was guilty of either manslaughter or second-degree murder, but that the jury agreed to acquit him after studying the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four other jurors issued a brief statement on court stationary late Tuesday saying that the opinions expressed by Juror B37 in the TV interview &quot;were her own, and not in any way representative of the jurors listed below.&quot; It was signed by Jurors B51, B76, E6 and E40.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four other jurors said in their statement that Martin&quot;s death weighed on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Serving on this jury has been a highly emotional and physically draining experience for each of us,&quot; the statement said. &quot;The death of a teenager weighed heavily on our hearts but in the end we did what the law required us to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also made a request for privacy. The court has not released the names of the six-woman jury, which included five whites and one woman who appeared to reporters to be Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of the Justice Department filing civil rights charges say additional evidence could exist in the federal investigation that didn&quot;t come up in the state prosecution of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the exact language of the law itself, the federal probe must navigate between sensitive racial and political issues that arose when Zimmerman initially wasn&quot;t charged in Martin&quot;s killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people simply cannot process how an unarmed teenager is killed, and yet no one is held criminally accountable for his death,&quot; said Marcellus McRae, a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resnick said a federal jury would have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman had a racial motive when he began following Martin and that he did not act in self-defense when he fired his gun.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 17--CONCORD -- New Hampshire's new attorney general said Wednesday state lawmakers should consider &quot;another look&quot; at New Hampshire's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law after a repeal effort failed earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments by Joseph Foster came after United States Attorney General Eric Holder strongly condemned such state laws Tuesday in an address to the NAACP in Florida. Holder commented in the wake of the George Zimmerman acquittal in the Trayvon Martin case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bill to repeal New Hampshire's &quot;stand your ground law&quot; was passed by the House this year but then tabled by the state Senate, on a bipartisan vote of 19-5. The session ended with the bill still tabled, effectively killing it but leaving the issue available to be considered again next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foster told UnionLeader.com he respects the legislative process, but, &quot;In due course, it would warrant taking a look at it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This office opposed its passage and supported its repeal&quot; before Foster was confirmed as attorney general in April, he noted. Foster's predecessor, Michael Delaney, strongly opposed the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foster, a former state senator said that before he was attorney general, he opposed &quot;stand your ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In due course, it would be wise to take another look at it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what it can do is cause a situation to escalate that doesn't need to,&quot; said Foster. &quot;And it could result in serious harm to not only the initial actors but others in the wrong set of circumstances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under prior state law, Foster said, &quot;you only had to retreat if you could safely do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foster said he is not on a &quot;bully pulpit&quot; calling for repeal, but said that when he was asked about it by the media Wednesday, he stated his views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Hampshire's current &quot;stand your ground&quot; law allows for the use of deadly force if a victim &quot;reasonably believes&quot; deadly force is about to be used against him. Such force can be used wherever the victim encounters a perceived attacker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law was passed in 2012 by the then-GOP-controlled state Legislature over the veto of then-Gov. John Lynch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March of this year, the House, controlled by Democrats, voted narrowly -- 189-184 -- to repeal it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate, however tabled the repeal bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The repeal bill's prime sponsor, House Majority Leader Steve Shurtleff, D-Penacook, said he may try to revive the bill next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would talk to people on both sides of the aisle and in both bodies and see if they felt it had merit,&quot; said Shurtleff. &quot;I would talk to Democrats and Republicans, and if they felt there was a good chance of passage, then possibly I would bring it back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder on Tuesday told the NAACP, &quot;These laws try to fix something that was never broken,&quot; according to The Washington Post. The list of resulting tragedies is long and, unfortunately, has victimized too many who are innocent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP is pressuring Holder to file federal civil charges against Zimmerman, the Post reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Post, more than 30 states have versions of &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* George Zimmerman Verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zimmerman Trial Reaction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Florida's self-defense law should be taken off the books is one of many issues at center stage since 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was shot and killed by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman and a six-woman jury on Saturday acquitted Zimmerman of a second-degree murder charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those weighing in have ranged from Attorney General Eric Holder - - who denounced the law Tuesday, saying &quot;it's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhood&quot; -- to celebrities like musician Stevie Wonder, who said he won't perform in Florida until the law is abolished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passed in 2005, stand your ground was intended to give citizens clarification on how they could act in the face of danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before then, the &quot;castle doctrine&quot; afforded people the right to defend their homes and property but also gave people the general duty to retreat if possible, said state Sen. David Simmons, a Republican from Altamonte Springs whose district includes southwest Volusia County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That requirement elevated the life of a criminal over a victim,&quot; Simmons said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stand your ground, co-authored by Simmons, gave people the right to use deadly force if there is a &quot;reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily harm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is truly reserved only to innocent victims,&quot; Simmons said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Public Defender Matt Phillips was the first attorney in the 7th Judicial Circuit covering Volusia and Flagler counties to successfully argue stand-your-ground immunity in a murder case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities said 76-year-old Earnest Johnson stabbed his 53-year- old stepson Roscoe Shepard, who had been upset over the recent death of his mother and Johnson's dating of another woman. Phillips contended Shepard beat Johnson with a baseball bat, was threatening him and that the stabbing was in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the law is working as intended,&quot; Phillips said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Martin killing, stand your ground affected various aspects of how the case was investigated, but Phillips believes it didn't change the overall outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford's former police chief cited the law as his reason for not initially arresting Zimmerman in February 2012. Zimmerman told police Martin was beating him during the confrontation and that he feared he would be killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's defense team stayed away from stand-your-ground arguments -- even waiving the right to an immunity hearing -- but the statute was part of Circuit Judge Debra Nelson's instructions to the jury, allowing the panel to consider it as a legitimate defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With or without the statute, I think (Zimmerman) would have had a case for self-defense,&quot; Phillips said. &quot;Stand your ground has kind of become the scapegoat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, many law enforcement officers see it differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a bad law,&quot; said Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood. &quot;It empowers people to put themselves in bad situations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited a case his department worked in 2010 when Tarrence Gatlin, 18, and Leonard Murphy met in an apartment complex parking lot for a drug deal involving prescription pills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gatlin tried to rob Murphy without giving him pills, police said, and Murphy shot Gatlin three times. The killing was cleared through stand your ground, even though the statute does not protect people engaged in an unlawful activity, Chitwood said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson, a supporter of gun rights, said the stand your ground law discourages restraint in the use of deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flagler County Sheriff Jim Manfre said the law can hinder investigations if people invoke stand your ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manfre said Paul Miller, who was convicted of gunning down his neighbor Dana Mulhall in 2012 after an argument over barking dogs, was initially detained and then released after Miller claimed he shot in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has created more confusion than it has created protection,&quot; Manfre said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate has spread far beyond courtrooms and police stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comedy Central's &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; contrasted the Zimmerman case with that of a black Jacksonville woman who was sentenced to 20 years in prison after firing a gun in the air to ward off her abusive husband, concluding that the state's motto should be changed from the &quot;Sunshine State&quot; to the &quot;Worst State.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young protesters have occupied Gov. Rick Scott's office since Tuesday, lobbying the governor to call a special session and ask legislators to change the law. Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton added his voice to the repeal drive, calling the law the &quot;worst violation of civil rights in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until we can overturn stand your ground, we risk more Trayvon&nbsp;Martins,&quot; Sharpton said Wednesday at the NAACP national convention in Orlando. &quot;We cannot have our sons' and daughters' lives on the line for anybody who wants to pursue them and shoot them and say it was self-defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man who helped write the law, though, said he doesn't see stand your ground being reversed and has faith in the judicial system to correctly apply it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's better for a guilty person to go free than convict an innocent victim,&quot; Simmons said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOW that George Zimmerman has been cleared of all charges in the killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, he intends to reclaim the gun he used to shoot dead the unarmed 17-year-old. According to his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, Zimmerman needs a firearm to protect himself now &quot;even more&quot; than before. Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, O'Mara said Zimmerman, 29, &quot;feels, truly in his heart, that if he did not have that weapon (on the night of the shooting) he might not be here.&quot; - INM <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Charles' $31m &quot;~fair '</SPAN><BR></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A crowd of about 100 people gathered downtown Tuesday for a vigil in reaction to the Florida acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, chanting &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; and carrying signs that read &quot;Another world is possible.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We felt very compelled to take a stand in Orange County,&quot; said Joese Hernandez, 27, an organizer with El Centro Cultural de Mexico in Santa Ana. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowds gathered at Sasscer Park around an altar with Martin's photo next to bags of Skittles and candles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 8:30 p.m., protesters peacefully walked down Ross, Main and Fourth streets with candles and fists up in the air. The rally ended after 9 p.m. at the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters carried signs reading &quot;We are human, not criminal&quot; while chanting &quot;The people say guilty.&quot; A handful of Santa Ana Police Department cars trailed the crowds and monitored traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hernandez said organizers did not expect unruliness like the Monday night demonstration in Los Angeles. At a news conference Monday night, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said violence and vandalism on city streets had resulted in 13 arrests during a protest over Zimmerman's acquittal. L.A. Police Chief Charlie Beck said about 150 people broke off from a larger, peaceful protest and began committing multiple acts of vandalism and assaults. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Santa Ana, &quot;We didn't want to stand aside while the country was marching in solidarity with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Hernandez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this case is a reminder of the fact that our livelihood is in danger simply because of the color of our skin,&quot; said Genesis Hernandez, 19, who was home for summer break from Vassar College in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another protest for Martin is scheduled in Santa Ana from 6 to 8 p.m. Thursday at 1104 S. Bristol St.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO --For Eric Holder, the country's first black attorney general, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death and George Zimmerman's acquittal of second-degree murder and manslaughter are personal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting of the unarmed 17-year-old last year prompted the attorney general to have a conversation with his 15-year-old son that Holder's father had with him years before, about how young black men should interact with the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was a father-son tradition I hoped would not need to be handed down. But as a father who loves his son and who is more knowing of the ways of the world, I had to do this to protect my boy,&quot; Holder told a rapt audience at the NAACP national convention in Orlando Tuesday evening. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman verdict was delivered late Saturday night at the Seminole County courthouse, less than 30 miles from the convention site and just hours after it began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder emphasized his department's pursuit of possible federal hate crime charges against the neighborhood watch volunteer and castigated &quot;senseless&quot; &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws that one juror in a post-trial TV appearance said contributed to the acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Holder delivered his Orlando remarks, more than 40 demonstrators in Tallahassee staged a sit-in at Gov. Rick Scott's office. They demanded a special session on stand your ground and other laws they say contributed to Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods. These laws try to fix something that was never broken,&quot; Holder said, receiving a standing ovation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department began an investigation into possible criminal civil rights violations after the shooting last year but put the review on hold until the trial was completed. That review is again underway, Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to assure you that the Department of Justice will continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law. We will not be afraid. We are committed to doing everything possible to ensure that in every case, in every circumstance and in every community justice must be done,&quot; he said, again eliciting loud applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 million signatures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP received more than 1 million online signatures for a petition demanding that Holder's department charge Zimmerman with a federal civil rights crime, an issue that has become a focal point of the convention, which ends today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key to charging Zimmerman lies in whether evidence exists that he was motivated by racial animosity to kill Martin. And while Martin's family has said the teen was racially profiled, no evidence surfaced during the state trial that Zimmerman had a racial bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the February 2012 death after claiming he fired his weapon in self-defense only after Martin attacked him. No evidence surfaced in the trial that Zimmerman had a racial bias, and his friends and family have repeatedly denied he harbored animosity toward blacks. Florida did not use its hate crime laws in prosecuting Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman could get life in prison if charged and convicted under federal hate crime laws. But many legal analysts doubt a federal case would succeed. A federal jury would have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman had a racial motive when he began following Martin and that he did not act in self-defense when he fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAACP President Benjamin Jealous believes there is enough evidence to prove that race was a motive. He pointed to testimony of Zimmerman's cousin who said she believed race was a factor, reports from black youths in the townhouse community who believed Zimmerman targeted and harassed them because they are black, and a history of calls he made to the police, including on the night he shot Martin last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They really need to dig into the fact that this wasn't just criminal profiling,&quot; Jealous told reporters. &quot;There's reason to believe that this was racial profiling, that he so feared young black men, perhaps because of the context of what was happening in his community, that he mistook somebody's color for grounds for suspicion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The not guilty verdict is again shining a spotlight on stand your ground laws, which came under intense scrutiny immediately after Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights launched an investigation last year into whether the laws are biased. In a statement issued Tuesday, Commissioner Michael Yaki blamed the law. The commission will &quot;pursue this investigation wherever it leads,&quot; Yaki wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's first-in-the-nation stand your ground law, passed in 2005, became a model for other states. The law allows people who feel threatened to use deadly force and removed the &quot;duty to retreat&quot; in public confrontations. The law also provides immunity from prosecution, something Zimmerman's lawyers did not use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of the law say it did not have an impact on the Zimmerman case, but the stand your ground law did come into play because it changed the justification about the use of deadly force and what juries are told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony,&quot; read the instructions given to the six-woman jury that acquitted Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the old law, defendants who were wrongfully attacked could not justify a deadly use of force if they could have avoided the confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday evening, about 40 students moved out of the governor's office and prepared to camp out inside the Capitol, waiting for Scott to return from New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott's office issued a statement saying &quot;his heart goes out to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family and all those affected by his death.&quot; But he remained steadfast about stand your ground, citing a task force he'd appointed. &quot;This task force listened to Floridians across the state and heard their viewpoints and expert opinions on this law. The task force recommended that the law should not be overturned, and Gov. Scott agrees,&quot; Scott's spokeswoman Melissa Sellers wrote.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed, 17-year-old black youth, was profiled, pursued and killed by an armed civilian. Shortly after, the Urban League of Palm Beach County marched in protest, demanding justice for Trayvon. It has taken more than a year, but the criminal justice system has rendered a not-guilty verdict, one that we all must respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We ask that in the wake of this verdict you continue to pray and hope for continued healing for the Martin family and all who mourn his death. Also, we are urging the residents of Palm Beach County and citizens throughout Florida to remain peaceful. Our energy should be directed toward the improvement and safety of our neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict has given us another challenge to overcome with our youth. How will it affect them directly and indirectly? What do we tell and teach them with regard to this case and its outcome? We will continue to work tirelessly in our community to address these and other needs of our youth through education, awareness and exposure to issues affecting their lives. We will help to shape the conversation with our young men and women on how to safely engage with an individual or group in a wide variety of circumstances that involve civilians and law enforcement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we respect the verdict of our justice system, as this case was tried based on current law, our resources will be focused on working with the Florida Legislature to revise or repeal Florida's self-defense and &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws. It is a travesty that George Zimmerman was not held accountable for his actions. And while it seems as though justice took the night off for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, we must place our efforts on making sure that it doesn't take the night off for another innocent youth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are living in an America where good is now &quot;evil&quot; and evil is considered &quot;good.&quot; I thought the O.J. Simpson jurors were dishonest. Then we had the Casey Anthony jurors, and now the latest disgrace of the American judicial system in the George Zimmerman verdict. This man's own words should have been more than enough to convict him. He clearly showed hatred and uncontrolled anger toward Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman provoked incident</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A young boy is dead because another man was able to patrol the streets and take the law into his own hands. George Zimmerman acted as judge and jury on the night that he encountered Trayvon&nbsp;Martin coming from a store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would he have made that decision if he was not armed? What made him think he was capable of handling the situation? Why was he carrying a gun if he had no intention of using the weapon? The verdict took into account reasonable doubt. The one thing that cannot be doubted is that Mr. Zimmerman precipitated this incident by not listening to the police dispatcher and stalking Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. And within the context of the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, he was able to provoke this confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would be alive today if George Zimmerman had not followed him. It will now be possible for people to claim self-defense even if they provoke a situation creating the need for self-defense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does &quot;stand your ground&quot; apply only to the person with the gun? Does the unarmed person have a right to defend himself?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was walking home from a convenience store. George Zimmerman felt suspicious of this black teenager and followed him in his car. He called the police, who took note and asked Mr. Zimmerman to stand down and stop following him. Mr. Zimmerman continued to follow Mr. Martin. Then he stopped the car, got out and approached Mr. Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who is threatening whom? Wouldn't any of us feel threatened if someone followed us in a car, then stopped it, got out and approached us? Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have tried to run. Perhaps he chose to stand his ground and respond to Mr. Zimmerman's threat with his bare hands. He cannot tell us his side of the story. Mr. Zimmerman lives to tell the tale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Self-defense&quot; or &quot;stand your ground&quot; is much easier if you have the gun and the other person is unarmed. Maybe &quot;stand your ground&quot; applies only to the survivor. Especially if he is armed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">System was rigged against Martin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before &quot;stand your ground,&quot; George Zimmerman could not have ignored police warnings, chased after Trayvon&nbsp;Martin -- who was doing nothing other than walking home -- shot Trayvon during an argument and then claimed self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, the jury struggled with this case for 16 hours. But the jury instructions from the court forced the jurors to consider &quot;stand your ground&quot; rules and narrow their focus to the moments just before George Zimmerman pulled the trigger, ignoring the fact that George Zimmerman started the fateful series of events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news media demand that we accept and respect the jury's verdict, knowing all the while that the system was rigged against Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. The sad message is that the police, the court system and our state prosecutors cannot protect our children from people like George Zimmerman. The &quot;stand your ground&quot; law was not the result of citizen demand but rather a corporate effort through such groups as the National Rifle Association and the American Legislative Exchange Council. We as a nation must break the stranglehold that these groups have on our legislators, or be prepared to buy a lot more guns.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's acquittal does not indicate that nothing went wrong on the night of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death. Everything went wrong. A 17-year-old boy should make it home after going out to buy Skittles, and feelings of sadness toward the outcome of the trial are reasonable.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that The Post Editorial Board and I were watching different cases. I understood the facts, and you heard what you wanted to hear. Your paper keeps coming back to the fact that if George Zimmerman never got out of the truck none of this would have happened. Actually, had Trayvon&nbsp;Martin been a decent student and hadn't been suspended, he would never have been in Sanford. Your &quot;child&quot; was no child.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An expedited autopsy carried out by the British Columbia Coroners Service showed that the 31-year-old Canadian thesp died from a &quot;mixed drug toxicity, involving heroin and alcohol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 31-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Glee</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> star was found dead Saturday alone in a Vancouver hotel room.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The findings suggest Monteith, who had waged a long, public battle with drug and alcohol addiction, eventually succumbed to his demons, despite his insistence that he had stayed clean and sober since completing a 30-day stint in rehab in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 2011, Monteith had revealed details about his substance-abuse problems, telling Parade mag that by age 13 he was skipping class to get drunk and stoned. He said he was fully &quot;out of control&quot; by the time he was 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Anything and everything, as much as possible,&quot; he told Parade. &quot;I had a serious problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monteith said that although he couldn't change his past, he felt it had helped him mature until he felt he could resist the temptations fame brought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I feel like I'm kind of Hollywood-proof,&quot; he said. &quot;Considering everything I've gone through, I feel like I've already been there and done that lifestyle to the nth degree.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wonder, 63, admitted his action would not bring Martin back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But,&quot; he said, &quot;we can let our voices be heard. And we can vote in our various countries throughout the world for change and equality for everybody. That's what I know we can do.&quot;</SPAN></P>

USA Today suggests the season premiere may be pushed back to late October, after the World Series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other problems involve how to incorporate the actor's death on the show itself, which costars his real-life girlfriend, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Lea Michele</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN ANNUAL ceremony honoring the life of the late Mayor Frank Rizzo was canceled yesterday following weekend protests over the acquittal of neighborhood-watch volunteer George Zimmerman in the deadly shooting of Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statue of Rizzo, which sits in front of the Municipal Services Building in Center City, became a focus of protesters, who hung a sign on it Sunday that read, &quot;The system is still racist.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the statue was built in 1998, supporters have gathered there annually on the anniversary of Rizzo's death - July 16 - but organizers agreed Monday evening that it would be best to hold the 22nd annual memorial service another day to avoid any conflict with protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was a tough decision,&quot; organizer Hank Cisco said. &quot;I thought going down there would only incite more problems. I feel that was for the safety of all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman, 29, who identifies himself as Hispanic, shot and killed unarmed Martin, 17, an African-American, in Sanford, Fla., as the teenager was traveling from a corner store last year. Zimmerman was acquitted at the conclusion of the three-week trial over the weekend, sparking protests across the country, spotlighting the issue of racial profiling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cisco and Frank Rizzo Jr., the late mayor's son and a former city councilman, were shocked to see on television news the statue decorated with protesters' signs. Rizzo Sr. had a relatively contentious relationship with the African-American community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rizzo Jr. agreed that organizers made the right decision to delay the ceremony. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My dad would want that, as a guy who promoted peace,&quot; Rizzo said, adding, &quot;I'm disappointed, but I'd be more disappointed if something took away from that day.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFTER THE not-guilty verdict in the George Zimmerman murder trial, I waited in earnest for the Monday morning Daily News to see how the paper's intrepid writers would trash the verdict and make excuses in favor of Trayvon Martin and bash George Zimmerman. I was not disappointed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, I and a majority of Americans who followed the case are not horrified that the verdict was not guilty. I thought this was a media-inspired lynching from the beginning. This decedent is wholly responsible for his own death. All evidence and witness accounts prove that Martin attacked Zimmerman.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also disagree that this incident will prevent &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws from being enacted. If anything, this incident proves their necessity. A decent citizen should always be allowed to defend himself; this case should bolster legislatures around the country to allow their citizens the necessary legal background to do so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It matters not that Zimmerman followed Martin. He was a member of a neighborhood watch - that's what they do, follow suspicious persons and keep neighborhoods safe, and by all accounts Martin looked suspicious. It doesn't matter that Zimmerman got out of his vehicle to follow Martin - not illegal. Elmer Smith tried to interject the tidbit that Martin had the right to stand his ground, but for what? Martin didn't have to stand his ground to anything because he wasn't a victim of any crime, he was the aggressor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Put aside the media fog about that night in Florida and things are much simpler than what's been reported in the media: It was an act of self-defense to stop a threat. And it's appalling how the legacy media fed the masses such nonsense, such as photos of Martin as a 12-year-old and the edited 9-1-1 calls, and continue to do so, with Ronnie Polaneczky's and Elmer Smith's totally biased articles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the last five years, I watched a once great country take a downward spiral. This verdict has given me hope that maybe, just maybe, the rule of law will return to being in fashion, away from the spin and silly nonsense we're fed by the Daily News and the rest of the legacy media. I also hope that George Zimmerman is victorious with his lawsuit against NBC for their edited 9-1-1 tapes that defamed his character, and that one day the media stop their pursuit of ratings and once again report the facts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Sexton </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philadelphia </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm just beginning to realize that the U.S. is ruled by the socialistic media and not the people or politicians. Years ago, the media was neutral and just told the people what was going on in the country and did not cater to either the left or right. Sorry to say, those days are over and most of our media have turned to the left and not to the center. All they are interested in is the revenue they can get from advertisements and not the truth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They realize that they are a dying breed of honest reporting. I'm beginning to realize that they are bearers of vermin sent to not-too-bright Americans. Just one example is the Zimmerman case. Why all of a sudden did the media decide to take on the Zimmerman case when every year there are a dozen cases like that? Why the sudden interest? They just want to get the attention that would bring revenue into their dying coffers and cause race problems. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, why did the media have a photo of that so-called child Martin when he was 12 years old? Martin, according to past records, was always in trouble. Smoking weed was only one problem of many he had. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What made me angrier was the fact of a lot of browns and Caucasians who must be on some type of high medicine protesting in the streets for this so-called child. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another thing is that the news media might be working behind the scenes for the Obama administration. I think the intelligent Americans know that they want Benghazi, IRS and the spying of an innocent Fox reporter off the headlines. I hate to say this, but if the media denies what I'm saying they are not only scum of the earth but also the biggest liars on earth. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good to see Elmer Smith back writing again. His race-baiting prose regarding the Zimmerman acquittal is a welcome relief to the liberal media's fair and balanced reporting on this current event. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome back, Elmer, it has been a while. I thought you died. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The People of Florida vs. George Zimmerman is a direct reflection of how social media has influenced our society tremendously. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would've never imagined that such a trial could yield a public response from both President Obama and Mayor Nutter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Way before any verdict was read, its impact resonated throughout our entire country. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, July 17 -- Amid continuing protests that turned violent in Los Angeles and Oakland, a juror in the George Zimmerman trial has revealed that the six-woman jury was initially split down the middle over handing a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict, but asserted that all were in agreement that race did was not a factor in the shooting death of black teenager Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An initial vote was divided.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While civil rights activists and African-American protesters are all convinced that it was a race-driven crime, the juror, with her identity concealed, asserted: &quot;All (the six) of us thought race did not play a role. We never had that discussion.&quot; Identified simply as Juror B37, she said Zimmerman didn't use &quot;good judgment&quot; while confronting Martin, but believed that the acquitted white-Hispanic neighbourhood watch volunteer was &quot;a man whose heart was in the right place&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror said she had &quot;no doubt&quot; Zimmerman feared for his life in the final moments of his struggle with Martin. &quot;He had a right to defend himself,&quot; she said, commenting: &quot;I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into. I think both of them could have walked away. It just didn't happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a federal investigation is currently on to look at the civil rights aspects of the case, doubts are being expressed by experts on whether the Obama administration would be able to charge Zimmerman with a federal hate crime because of the reported weakness of the evidence on this score.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday termed Martin's killing a &quot;tragic, unnecessary shooting death&quot; and said the Justice Department was &quot;determined to meet division and confusion with understanding and compassion - and also with truth&quot;. But some other department officials, past and present, were cited by The Washington Post as saying that bringing criminal civil rights charges against Zimmerman would be extremely difficult. &quot;The weakness of the evidence compounds the political problems facing President Obama and Holder, who are under mounting pressure from many liberal and African-American groups,&quot; the paper noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The backlash over the verdict continued across America with protests, vigils and prayers. Although largely peaceful in most places, violence broke out in the Californian cities Los Angeles and Oakland. In Los Angeles, demonstrators stomped on cars, attacked bystanders and stormed a Wal-Mart. 14 people were held Monday night after multiple acts of vandalism. In Oakland, a large gathering of protesters blocked peak hour traffic.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Is this still America?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Thomas Sowell</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">555 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no winners in the trial of George Zimmerman. The only question is whether the damage that has been done has been transient or irreparable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legally speaking, Zimmerman has won his freedom. But he can still be sued in a civil case, and he will probably never be safe to live his life in peace, as he could have before this case made him the focus of national attention and orchestrated hate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important than the fate of George Zimmerman, however, is the fate of the American justice system and of the public's faith in that system and in their country. People who have increasingly asked, during the lawlessness of the Obama administration, &quot;Is this still America?&quot; may feel some measure of relief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the very fact that this case was brought in the first place, in an absence of serious evidence, will be of limited encouragement as to how long this will remain America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political perversion of the criminal justice system began early and at the top, with the president of the United States. Unlike other public officials who decline to comment on criminal cases that have not yet been tried in court, Barack Obama chose to say, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot; It was a clever way to play the race card. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it did not stop there. After the local police in Florida found insufficient evidence to ask for Zimmerman to be prosecuted, the Obama administration sent Justice Department investigators to Sanford, Fla., and used taxpayers' money to finance local activists who agitated for Zimmerman to be arrested. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political intervention did not end with the federal government. The city manager in Sanford intervened to prevent the usual police procedures from being followed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the question arose of identifying the voice calling for help during the confrontation between Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and George Zimmerman, the normal police procedure would have been to let individuals hear the recording separately, rather than have a whole family hear it together. When the city manager took this out of the hands of the police, and had Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family, plus Rachel Jeantel, all hear the recording together, that's politics, not law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was just one way that this case looked like something out of &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot; Both in the courtroom and in the media, educated and apparently intelligent people said things that they seemed sincerely to believe, but which were unprovable and often even unknowable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury indicated, as their deliberations began, that they wanted to compare hard evidence, when they asked for a complete list of the testimony on both sides. Once the issue boiled down to hard, provable facts, the prosecutors' loud histrionic assertions and sweeping innuendoes were just not going to cut it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor was repeatedly calling Zimmerman a liar effective, especially when the prosecution misquoted what Zimmerman said, as an examination of the record would show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only real heroes in this trial were the jurors. They showed that this is still America - at least for now - despite politicians who try to cheapen or corrupt the law, as if this were some banana republic.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some are already calling for a federal indictment of George Zimmerman, after he has been acquitted. Will this still be America then? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Sowell is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's question </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department says it is looking into the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges against former neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Over the weekend, a Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and other charges. Civil rights organizations have been holding rallies and vigils across the country protesting the verdict.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you believe the Justice Department should file criminal civil rights charges against Zimmerman for the shooting death of Martin? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes: 230 (8 percent) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No: 2,604 (92 percent) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KQV runs two polls simultaneously, one from Internet users, the other from telephone callers. The nonscientific polls often do not reflect the same results. KQV updates its results from time to time, so the results on its website may vary from these results. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday's question </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wall Street Journal reports employers have added more part-time employees in 2013, averaging 93,000 a month, seasonally adjusted, than full-time workers, which have averaged 22,000. Many restaurants and other businesses are trying to avoid the Affordable Care Act provision requiring employers with 50 or more full-time employees to supply affordable health insurance or pay a fine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you think the Affordable Care Act will negatively impact full-time job opportunities in the future? </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No: Call 412-333-9192 </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their various wording, the headlines across America proclaimed the basic news: Zimmerman Not Guilty. But hold the presses. Those headlines missed the point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, George Zimmerman, that mound of cream pies posing as a wannabe cop, was found not guilty in a Florida courtroom in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. But there was another defendant -- one more significant for the rest of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant firearm, Kel-Tec 9 mm, goes scott-free, as usual, because, as we are constantly told, guns don't kill people. And because guns don't kill people, Mr. Zimmerman could not have killed anyone in a way that mattered. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin might disagree, but he is not alive to say so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wasn't a perfect kid -- he had been in some trouble and was suspended from school and had a small trace of marijuana in his system -- but he did nothing that deserved the death penalty. In short, he was not unlike many kids in America, white or black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he had a right to be where he was. According to the legal system, Mr. Zimmerman also had a right to shoot him with the unindicted co-conspirator, Kel-Tec. To my mind, any resemblance to justice is purely coincidental.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others argue that justice was indeed done, that a trial was held, the jury considered all the evidence, witnesses gave conflicting testimony and the jury decided that, in the murky circumstances of the fatal encounter, it could not vote for a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is fine if your definition of justice is satisfied just by making a decent show and observing all the formal particulars. Some of us, in our old-fashioned obstinacy, hold the view that the performance counts for little if it does not achieve a just resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may very well be that in its own limited legal terms the trial came to the only conclusion that fits the law, but let us consider the essence of what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this consideration let us put away the diversion of race for the moment -- although, goodness knows, if Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had been a white boy in a jacket and tie, and not a black boy in a dark hoodie, George Zimmerman might not have found him suspicious in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we'll put that common sense aside anyway, because it is impossible to delve into the hearts of the participants, and, moreover, the simple facts speak eloquently enough -- and they fit situations anywhere at any time regardless of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 17-year-old boy is returning home from the store with ice tea and Skittles. A wannabe cop armed with a gun, at least 11 years older than the boy and some 40 pounds heavier, decides that the kid is one of those [bad word] who always get away, as we know from his call to the 911 operator. He gives chase, although he is explicitly told not to by the operator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, he is the instigator. He is the big man, and the only one with the gun, and he gets into a fight. True, we don't know who confronted whom in the end, but he was losing the fight and he shot the smaller boy. If he hadn't followed the boy, if he didn't have a gun, none of this happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So a jury concludes that he was justified in defending himself. Of course it does. As mentioned in the jury instructions, Florida has a stand-your-ground law, which was invented to allow people to shoot those they fear will do them great harm. It is up to the shooter to decide the threat. The shooter gets to be the judge, jury and executioner, and the trial lasts only a second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why a boy only armed with Skittles and ice tea can't stand his ground is anyone's guess. In the face of such insanity, the words that come to mind are from Charles Dickens: &quot;If the law supposes that,&quot; said Mr. Bumble ... &quot;the law is a ass, a idiot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 30 states have such asinine laws, including Pennsylvania. It is one thing to say that people have the right to defend themselves and their homes with guns -- if the circumstances are exceptional, I certainly agree -- but it is another to give the feckless George Zimmermans of world a license to kill, as if each were an un-suave James Bond. In this case, the stand-your-ground law stood up for the avenging bully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stand-your-ground laws serve not just the vulnerable but the cowardly and the bloodthirsty. They are pacts of death often passed -- irony of ironies -- by politicians who are ostensibly pro-life. Truly, it was the gun that was vindicated here. Sometimes laws kill people.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been a big week for apologies in sports. Steelers Pro Bowl center Maurkice Pouncey apologized to those he offended by wearing a &quot;Free Hernandez&quot; hat Saturday night in apparent support of his former University of Florida teammate, Aaron Hernandez, who is facing an execution-style murder charge. Victor Cruz of the New York Giants and Roddy White of the Atlanta Falcons apologized for controversial tweets they made after George Zimmerman was acquitted Sunday in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Texas A&amp;M quarterback Johnny Manziel apologized to his coaches for generally being an immature jerk since he won the Heisman Trophy in December. Don't be surprised if Brooklyn Nets coach Jason Kidd is next to apologize after pleading guilty Tuesday to a misdemeanor drunken driving charge from 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a lot of regret, real or coerced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've become hardened by it all. It seems as if an athlete does something stupid or even criminal every day and then apologizes for it 24 hours later. Is it just me or is it difficult to take the apology seriously? I struggle to see the sincerity. It's much easier to see a cover-my-behind mentality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did Pouncey's apology on Twitter -- where else these days? -- come from his heart or was it prompted by his Steelers bosses? I'm betting on choice two. Not to be cynical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people had questions and were troubled by the Zimmerman verdict. A lot were angry about what they perceived to be racial injustice. But few reacted as outrageously as Cruz and White. Cruz tweeted, &quot;Thoroughly confused. Zimmerman doesn't last a year before the hood catches up to him.&quot; White wrote on Twitter that the jurors in the case should &quot;go home and kill themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nice thoughts, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">React to violence by encouraging more violence?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's horrific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did Cruz apologize because the Giants insisted he do it? &quot;It was wrong,&quot; he said of his tweet on ESPN radio. &quot;I'm human and things happen and I own up to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did White apologize because his agent told him he could lose popularity with many in the Falcons fan base, not to mention lucrative endorsement deals? &quot;I understand my tweet was extreme,&quot; he wrote on Twitter. &quot;I never meant for the people to do that. I was shocked and upset about the verdict. I am sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Genuine apologies?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least Cruz spoke directly to his radio listeners. He didn't take the easy way out and apologize on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a lot of children that follow me, a lot of kids follow me and I don't want them to think I'm trying to incite violence on anyone. That's not what I'm here for. That's not what my intent was -- or is -- at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along that same line, the prosecutor in the Kidd case also talked about Kidd being a &quot;role model.&quot; Explaining why he settled for Kidd speaking to Long Island, N.Y., high school students about the dangers of drunken driving instead of pressing for a stiffer punishment, Suffolk County district attorney Thomas Spota said, &quot;He's going to have the opportunity to talk to [kids] about the foolish mistake that he made and the fact he took responsibility for his actions. That is, for me, more important than three years' probation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true. I know it's true. Athletes are role models for a lot of young people and even some badly misguided adults merely because they can catch a touchdown pass or make a 3-point shot or hit a home run. But that doesn't make it right. It's pretty disheartening, actually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's one thing to want to be like Manziel -- &quot;Johnny Football,&quot; as he's known -- on the field. He's a talented, exciting player. But there's nothing to be gained by anyone by using Manziel as some sort of moral compass. Actually, that's not entirely true. Kids can learn a lot about how not to behave by observing him. He has disrespected any number of people the past few months, most recently at the Manning Passing Camp in Louisiana. He didn't fulfill his commitment as a coach/counselor, citing illness, but there were reports he was partying heavily at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manziel is 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it really fair to him to expect him to be a role model? Is it fair to any athlete? It's great if they are wonderful people, but there's nothing in their job description that says they are responsible for your kids. You are responsible as a parent or as a guardian or as an influential person in a kid's life. A teacher, perhaps. A church figure. A coach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cruz conceded he still is trying to be a better man. His reputation is largely solid, as best I can tell. He touched the emotions of many in December when he visited the family of Jack Pinto, 6, a victim in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Conn. He was the boy's favorite player. The boy was buried wearing his jersey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the lesson Cruz said he learned from the reaction to his tweet?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You really have to watch what you say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are lessons you wish everyone could learn. Sadly, though, many people -- athletes and otherwise -- never do.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fallout from the acquittal of George Zimmerman has resulted in the cancellation of a book deal and a boycott of Florida by Stevie Wonder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 has reversed her decision and will no longer pen a book about the Zimmerman trial, the Wall Street Journal reports. Sharlene Martin of Martin Literary Management LLC released a statement late Monday night on behalf of the juror, who had earlier planned to pursue a book deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I realize it was necessary for our jury to be sequestered in order to protest [sic] our verdict from unfair outside influence, but that isolation shielded me from the depth of pain that exists among the general public over every aspect of this case. The potential book was always intended to be a respectful observation of the trial from my and my husband's perspectives solely and it was to be an observation that our &quot;system&quot; of justice can get so complicated that it creates a conflict with our &quot;spirit&quot; of justice,&quot; the statement said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 was one of the six anonymous jurors who acquitted George Zimmerman of all charges in connection with the shooting death of teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that I am returned to my family and to society in general, I have realized that the best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book and return instead to my life as it was before I was called to sit on this jury,&quot; the statement read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The partnership between the juror, who was listed during voir dire as &quot;a middle-aged white woman who works for a chiropractor and has many pets,&quot; and Ms. Martin began Sunday, according to an earlier statement from Ms. Martin. According to the Orlando Sentinel, information regarding the jurors came out during voir dire but was not in court documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the partnership was first announced, Ms. Martin said in a statement that the book &quot;could open a whole new dialogue about laws that may need to be revised and revamped to suit a 21st century way of life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Martin told the Journal via email that the decision to split &quot;was joint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday night, the anonymous juror went on CNN's &quot;AC360&quot; to talk about the trial and the not guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into,&quot; she said. &quot;I think they both could have walked away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost immediately after the interview aired, a change.org petition was started, asking Ms. Martin to drop Juror B37. &quot;That very juror, who allowed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's killer to get away, is writing a book. Please don't allow this person to profit off of the injustice that they've served to the American public. We deserve better. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family deserves better,&quot; the petition read. 1,127 people had signed the petition by 2 a.m. Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the Martin trial verdict, Stevie Wonder won't be performing in Florida anytime soon, according to the Hollywood Reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The singer said he would not be performing in the Sunshine State until its Stand Your Ground law is &quot;abolished.&quot; He also said he would not be performing in any other state that recognizes the law, which some say contributed to Mr. Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of Martin on Feb. 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I decided today that until the Stand Your Ground law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again,&quot; Wonder said Sunday while performing in Quebec City. &quot;As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some have argued that the law played no role in the acquittal. However, The Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates pointed out that it was cited in the jury instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr. Wonder also called for his fans' support of his boycott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The truth is that -- for those of you who've lost in the battle for justice, wherever that fits in any part of the world -- we can't bring them back,&quot; he said. &quot;What we can do is we can let our voices be heard. And we can vote in our various countries throughout the world for change and equality for everybody. That's what I know we can do.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been haunted by the facts that emerged from the trial of George Zimmerman and the killing of Trayvon Martin. The facts that emerged are tragic -- both for young Trayvon Martin and for our nation. Something is wrong with our laws, our system of justice, our society's priorities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grown man with a gun can profile, follow and ultimately shoot dead a 17-year-old kid and it's not against the law -- at least in Florida. This tragedy is not the jury's fault; they followed the law, and while I don't like their verdict, I do respect it. The heartbreaking truth is that the responsibility for this failure of justice lies with all of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not enough to be mad; it's not enough to be sad; we must change our laws, our system of justice and the cultural values that invite such tragic events. The underlying problems of racial inequality and gun violence continue to plague our nation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't press send!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what former NFL coach Herm Edwards says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coach-turned-ESPN-analyst speaks to incoming NFL rookies each year and talks about his dream of inventing a smart phone that would be smart enough to replace the &quot;send&quot; button with a &quot;don't press send&quot; button.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So when you tweet all that stuff out and you get ready to send it out, it will say, oh, Don't Press Send,&quot; Edwards tells the rookies. &quot;That's so you can think about what you're getting ready to press.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far too many athletes these days are pushing send before thinking about what they are saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I ran a pro sports team, or even a college program, I would forbid my athletes from using Twitter. And this is just a guess, but you watch: In the not-so-distant future, practically every pro and college team in the country will prohibit its players from using the social media site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has become too dangerous and simply not worth the risk for teams to endure the public embarrassment of reprimanding then apologizing for players who can't help but have a brain cramp in fewer than 140 characters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First of all, let's get one thing straight: As a sportswriter, I love that athletes use Twitter. It lets all of us know what they are thinking and doing, although I believe I would sleep just fine without the knowledge that Redskins backup quarterback Kirk Cousins thinks Home Alone is a great movie. (Yeah, he really did tweet that.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I, especially, love that many who use Twitter don't have that edit chip between their brains and their fingers. I love that they press &quot;send&quot; without thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the time, it's harmless stuff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the time Ohio State quarterback Cardale Jones tweeted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why should we have to go to class if we came here to play FOOTBALL, we ain't come to play SCHOOL classes are POINTLESS&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's sad and maybe even a bit insightful to see the honest feelings of college athletes, as well as their total lack of grammar skills. But, ultimately, no harm is being done here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Same as when Texas A&amp;M quarterback Johnny Manziel -- who, by the way, seems intent on becoming the Lindsay Lohan of college football -- tweeted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(Expletive) like tonight is a reason why I can't wait to leave college station...whenever it may be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often Twitter is used to criticize someone or start a feud, such as when U.S. women's soccer goalie Hope Solo was all in a huff when former U.S. women's star Brandi Chastain criticized the Americans while calling a game for ESPN. Solo tweeted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Its 2 bad we cant have commentators who better represents the team &amp; knows more about the game&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Occasionally, players will step over the line of good taste or common sense, like when Rashard Mendenhall, then with the Steelers, reacted to Americans celebrating the death of Osama bin Laden by tweeting:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What kind of person celebrates death? It's amazing how people can HATE a man they have never even heard speak. We've only heard one side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was followed by:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll never know what really happened. I just have a hard time believing a plane could take a skyscraper down demolition style&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Usually, within a few hours, these athletes have to send out some sort of apology that appears to have been written by someone with a college degree in public relations. It uses words like &quot;thoughtless&quot; and &quot;insensitive.&quot; It talks about having &quot;regret&quot; then closes with the obligatory, although often insincere-sounding, &quot;I apologize to anyone who might have been offended by my comments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past week, many athletes were swept up in the aftermath of George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. The Giants' Victor Cruz tweeted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zimmerman doesn't last a year before the hood catches up with him&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falcons wide receiver Roddy White suggested the jurors in the case should &quot;kill themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A short time later, White tweeted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's crazy how people on twitter want me to get in trouble for a tweet that they are retweeting because they want something to happen thanks&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, Cruz and White apologized for their remarks, saying they were made hastily in reaction to being stunned by Zimmerman being found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fair enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, virtually every ill-advised, apologetic or just plain dumb tweet typed out by an athlete is the result of a hastily slapped-together response to subjects that are probably best left alone. There are people who write for a living who don't make anything public until it is read by several editors, yet athletes will send out something without even reading it back themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though it's certainly Cruz's right to talk about the Zimmerman trial and Mendenhall is entitled to have an opinion on bin Laden, they shouldn't confuse freedom of speech with freedom from consequences. Sometimes it's just better to say nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, in other words, you can never go wrong by following these three words:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't Press Send.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An anonymous juror in the George Zimmerman trial is no longer writing a tell-all book after saying on CNN that an unarmed Trayvon Martin was partly to blame for his fate while his killer's &quot;heart was in the right place.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman, known as Juror B37, said she was unaware while sequestered of the widespread anger surrounding the racially charged case, saying she now &quot;realized that the best direction for me to go is away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following B37's interview with Anderson Cooper, the juror said in a statement that she'd changed her mind about writing the book with her husband, a lawyer, after signing a contract to do so earlier Monday. But it emerged Tuesday that the juror's literary agent, Sharlene Martin, was the first to have a change of heart following hours of social media pressure, particularly from one Twitter user with the handle &quot;Cocky McSwagsalot&quot; who started the ball rolling while watching the interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey @sharlenemartin, please drop Juror B37,&quot; one of the Tweets read. &quot;Do not let a person who helped a murderer get away profit from this tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social media campaign soon snowballed and Martin was at the heart of a Twitter firestorm. By 1 a.m., she reportedly messaged Cocky that she'd reconsidered representing the juror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37, indeed, has only served to further anger Americans dismayed by the not-guilty verdict handed down to Zimmerman over the weekend. The case has reopened wounds in a country where racial tensions still simmer in the aftermath of a sorry history of slavery and segregation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into,&quot; the juror told Cooper of the events of Feb. 26, 2012, which left Martin gunned down just blocks from his father's home in a gated community in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think they both could have walked away.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Regarding &quot;Zimmerman had the right to defend himself&quot; (Page A-5,  July 16):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    It is clear that the jury failed to understand the facts of this  case as the state presented them. Juries react to their impressions  about particular events. The prosecutor's job is to channel those  feelings toward a conviction while the defense is doing the  opposite.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In this case, as in many other cases (see O.J. Simpson), the  prosecution was not at the level of the defense. The defense team  consisted of the best criminal lawyers available while the  prosecution was represented by modest state employees clumsily  trying to explain the facts of the case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In order for the judicial process to be fair, the prosecutor should  come from a private law firm paid by the state with a negotiated  fee. Let the best criminal lawyers fight for the state and the  outcome undoubtedly will be more just and logical.   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Regarding &quot;Zimmerman acquittal: Verdict stirs North Jersey&quot; (Page  A-1, July 15):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Why do I feel in the minority regarding the decision in the George  Zimmerman trial?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The prosecution did not prove its case. Additionally, I believe  that the true impression of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was not depicted in the  media.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Also, being a retired detective in Passaic, I have seen firsthand  the kind of intimidation and threatening behavior that is all too  prevalent in the inner city. There were numerous times I was in  fear for my life while wearing a uniform. The media tend to go with  the politically correct stance instead of the facts.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Regarding &quot;Zimmerman acquittal: Verdict stirs North Jersey&quot; (Page  A-1, July 15):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The tragic death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin prompted many civil rights  activists to protest the jury's not-guilty verdict and demand that  young African-American men be &quot;respected and protected.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    One pundit said, &quot;It's just not safe to be a young black man in  this country.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    But the reality is that when you check actual FBI crime statistics,  you find that most of these young people who have been killed or  wounded were the victims of black-on-black crime.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In fact, during the same weekend that the Zimmerman jury was  deliberating in Florida, by that Sunday evening in Chicago, 54  people were shot and 10 were killed. The overwhelming majority of  those incidents involved African-Americans shot by fellow blacks.  The same is true in many other urban areas across the country.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The main question that arises is: Why aren't civil rights leaders  immediately traveling to Chicago to head anti-violence marches?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    If civil rights activists really want to honor the memory of  Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, they should be marching against violence by people  of any race, creed or color.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Regarding &quot;Zimmerman acquittal: Verdict stirs North Jersey&quot; (Your  Views, July 16):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Everyone seems to feel this is a racial issue. While some racial  profiling may have been involved, the real issue, as far as I'm  concerned, is gun control. If Zimmerman had not been packing a gun  that night, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would still be alive.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Westwood, July 16 <BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Patients should question health reform  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Physicians and their patients should voice their concerns regarding  the potential negative impact of the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act on the quality of medical services rendered.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The act is destined to seriously burden an already unmanageable  health care system by fostering a significant increase in potential  patients without providing the necessary support required.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    As an example, the state has accepted the act's increased Medicaid  funding commencing in 2014. Accordingly, an estimated 100,000  additional Medicaid beneficiaries will qualify to receive health  care in a system that cannot provide sufficient care to its  existing recipients.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The majority of licensed and board-certified internists and  family-care physicians in New Jersey are unable to see Medicaid  patients due to a very inadequate compensation rate. It is  virtually impossible for these patients to see board-certified  specialists at all.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    While the act will provide a limited number of billing codes for  primary care physicians to receive increased compensation at the  Medicare rate, there is no such provision for specialists and other  health care professionals. Therefore, Medicaid patients may be able  to get primary care but will not be able to utilize the medical  services of cardiologists, pulmonologists, neurologists,  rheumatologists and other well-trained and experienced specialists.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    It is the combination of superior primary care complemented by the  specialists that has resulted in high-quality health care in the  United States. Physicians and their patients are what health care  is about. Why are they relatively silent?  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Poor communication by NJ Transit  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Regarding &quot;$2.5M upgrade for central Westwood&quot; (Page L-2, July 1):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Rail service has been suspended on weekends for track work in  Westwood, and there's no daytime service on weekdays. When my  husband walked past the train station in Oradell, he saw numerous  people sitting there waiting for the train.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    There is no posting of this suspension anywhere at the station, and  if you didn't see the news in The Record, or commute daily, there  is no way you would know about it. My husband stopped to tell the  people who were waiting; one man said he had been waiting for 40  minutes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    While he was there, someone from NJ Transit came to refill the  ticket machine. Perhaps the new musical program being planned for  stations in Secaucus and Hoboken would be useful to entertain these  hapless customers while they wait for a train that never arrives.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    NJ Transit should be ashamed of its pathetic communication with  riders.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Regarding &quot;Deal brings new senior center one step closer&quot; (Page  L-1, July 13):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Thanks for the update on Bergen County taking over the Martin  Luther King Jr. Senior Center building. I've supported this center  along with my colleagues and watched over the years as previous  Hackensack administrations always seemed to find a way to keep the  building from moving forward. This dream for the many wonderful  folks at the MLK center is a long time coming.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Kudos to the Housing Authority of Bergen County and to County  Executive Kathleen Donovan for completing the dream.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Many wonderful folks attended the center for years as it operated  out of one room thanks to a church that housed it for so long. The  center has given back to the community with a tutoring program for  Hackensack schoolchildren. I now look forward at long last to the  opening of the center.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Regarding &quot;Down on the farm&quot; (Editorial, July 15):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    As The Record so aptly put it, &quot;Subsidies for farmers, but not a  dime for the federal food stamp program.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Left out of that discussion is the fact that my new congressman,  Scott Garrett, R-Wantage, supported what the newspaper accurately  pegged as a &quot;shameful vote.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    We did have a congressman who better represented our interests here  in the Hackensack area, but that representative, Steve Rothman,  D-Englewood, opted to avoid a fight with Garrett to run in a  primary that he lost. We now stand to lose a program that serves  more than 800,000 New Jersey residents because our representative  stands strictly for principles that serve his end, and not those of  the people.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges in a Florida courtroom by a jury of six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers of the San Bernardino march, Starh Hendrix, 26 of San Jacinto and Sharia Brown, 25, of San Bernardino, expected to have at least 100 people join them in a peaceful march for civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to sound off and tell the world we deserve justice, peace and equality in the justice system in the United States,&quot; Hendrix said. &quot;This is a peaceful march through the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the acquittal groups all over the nation have led protests chanting, &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the protests in California have led to rioting and random violence, but Hendrix and Brown demand that the San Bernardino march be done with peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it turns violent then what does that prove for our cause?&quot; Brown said. &quot;It would just take us back to the beginning and we'll have to start all over trying to get the same rights as everyone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury acquitted Zimmerman, 29, on Saturday of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the 2012 shooting death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida. The verdict touched off demonstrations in major U.S. cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors said Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, wrongly suspected Martin of being a criminal because he was black. Defense lawyers argued Zimmerman shot Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida law, which was approved in 2005 and has been copied in some form by about 30 other states, allows people fearing for their lives to use deadly force without having to retreat from confrontation, even if it is possible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I were murdered, I would want to be honored by having people be kinder to one another, by loving one another, not by people harming or killing innocent people and damaging property in my name. Fostering this spirit of hate and vengeance does nothing positive and only fosters more division and hate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Luther King Jr. put it this way: &quot;Like an unchecked cancer, hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity. Hate destroys a man's sense of values and his objectivity. It causes him to describe the beautiful as ugly and the ugly as beautiful, and to confuse the true with the false and the false with the true. Power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice. Justice at its best is love correcting everything that stands against love.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boycott Florida to change their laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is my opinion that George Zimmerman is guilty of profiling and murder. It is also my opinion that many Floridians are also displeased with the trial's outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main problem is that the people have to abide by the laws of the state, and in Florida some laws are incomprehensible. The best way to show one's displeasure with this situation is to boycott Florida products and services. Instead of holding &quot;peaceful marches&quot; that result in injury and property damage in your state, attack the problem at its root. This will impact the profit margin of the big corporations associated with these goods and services, which will cause them to &quot;persuade&quot; their paid politicians to review and correct the shortcomings of the legal system and allow Florida to progress from the 20th century into the 21st.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Escalation makes a bad situation worse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your editorial (Editorial, July 16) shows correctly that there was bad judgment on both Trayvon Martin's and George Zimmerman's part. Martin may well have &quot;jumped&quot; Zimmerman in a fit of stupid male teenage machismo. I am sure that most men can remember stupid things that they did as teenagers that could have had disastrous results. I know I can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the evidence I have seen is that Martin initiated the physical violence. When one escalates the confrontation from a verbal one to a physical one, bad things are likely to happen. The difference between Martin breaking Zimmerman's nose and pounding his head into a concrete walk is the difference between temporary discomfort and death or permanent damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe that most people in Zimmerman's situation would have done anything to stop that situation. Evidently the jury, after hearing all of the evidence, agreed that Zimmerman acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas not as behind as readers imply</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I read your reader jabs at the 19th century mentality in Texas, I couldn't help but think of Houston's Mayor Annise Parker, who is the first openly gay mayor of a major U.S. city. Couple this with the fact that her city just surpassed New York City as the most racially and ethnically diverse in the country, and it seems like folks are doing something right down there. Thankfully, we at least can be proud of our ranking as the country's snobbiest locale.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JACKSONVILLEc cThree days after a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty for the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the Rev. Jesse Jackson visited Jacksonville to call attention to another self-defense case that he called a &quot;travesty&quot; of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson spent an hour in a jailhouse visit with Marissa Alexander, 32, an African American who was sentenced to a mandatory 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot into the wall of her home in 2010 to end a violent argument with her abusive husband. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In one case Mr. Zimmerman kills a young man and walks away, free to kill again,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;And Marissa shot no one, hurt no one, and she's in jail for 20 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said the contrast in the Zimmerman and Alexander cases exposed injustices in the justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We see radical racial polarization in the judicial system,&quot; Jackson told the Florida Times-Union. &quot;That's a cause of great concern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After meeting with Alexander, Jackson spoke with Angela Corey, the state prosecutor who handled both the Martin and the Alexander cases. Corey told him that Alexander's case is in the appeal phase and out of her jurisdiction, but Jackson said he asked her to use her power to see that Alexander is released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ours was a moral appeal,&quot; he said. &quot;This mother has three children. They need their mother,&quot; he said, noting that Alexander had already served the three years originally offered to her by the state in a plea deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Dowd, a New York domestic violence attorney handling Alexander's appeal, contends she should not have been charged with felonies, but rather a misdemeanor, such as unlawful discharge of a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local leaders from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Action Network are calling for Florida Governor Rick Scott to pardon Alexander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROSECUTOR'S RECORD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Scott appointed Corey special prosecutor in the Zimmerman case and she brought second-degree murder charges against him, some legal experts said she had overcharged. After her office lost the case, many legal experts said prosecutors didn't have enough evidence to win a second degree murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Corey first ran for office in 2008, the tough-on-crime Republican prosecutor promised voters she would pursue criminals to the fullest extent of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey also garnered national condemnation when she charged 12-year-old Cristian Fernandez with first degree murder in the death of his two-year-old stepbrother. At the time, Fernandez faced mandatory life in prison if found guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Alexander case, Cory charged the 32-year-old woman with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon because her husband's two children were in the house during the argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander's case received little attention when she was convicted, but that changed after the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin killing cast a new spotlight on Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; self-defense laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, people fearing for their lives can use deadly force without having to retreat from a confrontation, even when it is possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander, a slightly built woman, said her husband, Rico Gray, was moving toward her threateningly when she fired into a kitchen wall. He had previously been convicted on a domestic violence charge for attacking her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray's two children were at home, in the living room. Prosecutors alleged that the shot endangered Gray and the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander filed a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; claim, but a judge ruled against her because Alexander chose to go back into the house with her gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury took just 12 minutes to find her guilty of three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Alexander fired a gun in the incident, Florida's &quot;10-20-Life&quot; mandatory-minimum sentencing guidelines required the judge to sentence her to 20 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, Alexander had an active restraining order against her husband and she carried a concealed weapons permit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: The unarmed African-American teen, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, was walking back to his father's house after buying candy at a nearby store -- a perfectly innocent and non-threatening activity. This was confirmed by a police report that noted there was &quot;no indication that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was involved in any criminal activity at the time of the encounter and should not have been accosted.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police dispatcher specifically prohibited George Zimmerman from approaching Martin. Ignoring police appeals, Zimmerman precipitated an altercation and an innocent victim was murdered in cold blood. Responding to intense public pressure, the police finally arrested Zimmerman after 44 long days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict is a travesty of a flawed criminal justice system that refused to treat the murder as a crime and has now left a vigilante a free man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system of racist brutality carried out against poor people and people of color in communities from Florida to New York to California to Texas and elsewhere is an affront to all Americans. Martin's tragic death follows a long pattern of police brutality against unarmed black youths such as Oscar Grant, Alan Blueford and Manuel Diaz and countless others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;stand your ground&quot; law is a throwback to the Wild West days when the fastest gunslinger lived. This a barbaric law and should be repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman verdict will imperil all Americans, especially black teens who will no longer feel safe in the &quot;land of the free and home of the brave.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iran</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was back in Washington last week urging us to bushwhack Iran for its failure to buckle to Israel's &quot;red line&quot; demands to end its nuclear activity. Clearly, Israel appears to be totally unconcerned about creating further turmoil in the Middle East, which is already raging with political upheaval and instability. Such a preemptive attack on Iran would cause oil prices to spike and could precipitate a serious downturn in our own economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military leaders and other U.S. and Israeli security officials from across the political spectrum have warned that an attack on Iran would likely provoke a full-scale regional war and accelerate the development of Iranian nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former U.S. national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski has said an attack on Iran would be &quot;an act of utter irresponsibility&quot; and &quot;potentially a significant immorality&quot; if the United States participated. Israel's security officials have described such a preemptive strike as &quot;madness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel would be far wiser to push for a nuclear-free zone endorsed by Iran's supreme leader and the non-aligned movement comprising 120 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inexplicably, a conference scheduled to be held in Finland was shunned by the U.S. and Israel. Israel continues to be coy about its own huge stockpile of nuclear weapons which Avner Cohen, an Israeli historian, called the &quot;world's worst kept secret.&quot; It is time Netanyahu stops huffing and puffing and drawing our war weary country into another disastrous conflict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four words of advice for African-Americans in the wake of George Zimmerman's acquittal:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wake the hell up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sunday after Zimmerman went free was a day of protest for many of us. From Biscayne Boulevard in Miami to Leimert Park in Los Angeles, to the Daley Center in Chicago to Times Square in New York City, African-Americans -- and others who believe in racial justice -- carried out angry, but mostly peaceful demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good. This is as it should have been. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if that's the end, if you just get it out of your system, then move ahead with business as usual, then all you did Sunday was waste your time. You might as well have stayed home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are living in a perilous era for African-American freedom. The parallels to other eras have become too stark to ignore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every period of African-American advance has always been met by a crushing period of push-back, the crafting of laws and the use of violence with the intent of eroding the new freedoms. Look it up:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 13th Amendment ended slavery. So the white South created a convict leasing system that was actually harsher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 14th Amendment guaranteed citizenship. So the white South rendered that citizenship meaningless with the imposition of Jim Crow laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 15th Amendment gave us the right to vote; it was taken away by the so-called &quot;grandfather clause.&quot; The Supreme Court struck that down, so the white South relied on literacy tests and poll taxes to snatch our ballots all over again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our history is a litany: two steps forward, one step back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil rights movement was the greatest step forward since emancipation. So we ought not be surprised to see voting rights eroded again, the Civil Rights Act attacked, the so-called &quot;War on Drugs&quot; used for the mass incarceration of black men. Or to see the killing of an unarmed child deliver a message as old as the Constitution itself: Black life is worth less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are in another period of push-back. And we don't even seem to know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It feels as if we have taken the great advances of the last half century -- the protective laws, the rise of the black middle class, the winning of the ballot, the flowering of options once considered unthinkable -- for granted. It feels as if we have come to regard progress as somehow inevitable, preordained, carved in stone, and irrevocable as a birthright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So yes, we need to wake the hell up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we were celebrating, others were calculating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we were writing nasty rap lyrics, they were writing senators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we were organizing Obama victory parties, they were organizing tea parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we were buying DVDs, they were buying candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we were sending texts, they were building propaganda machinery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we were resting on the past, they were seizing the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Granted, the preceding casts a wide net. Yes, there are many of us, African-Americans and others, who don't need the admonition, who are already awake, who have always been awake. More power to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are also many of us still sleeping. So let Trayvon Martin's death and the acquittal of his killer be a wake-up call. Let it be a spur to stop reacting and start pro-acting. Let it be a goad to become better informed. Let it be a reminder to organize. Let it be a reason to send a check to the NAACP. Let it be an incentive to join the social justice ministry at church. Let it be cause to write your congressperson. Let it be an impetus to teach and nurture your kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of all, let it be an alarm clock, ringing in the darkness of a new morning, calling conscience to account. Do not waste this moment. The time for sleeping is done.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- City leaders are reconsidering a proposal that would make it illegal to carry makeshift weapons, such as hammers, at protests after a downtown restaurant worker was struck in the face by a hammer-wielding vandal during a protest Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilman Noel Gallo, who heads the council's Public Safety Committee, said he will try Thursday to schedule a debate on the plan that council members quickly dropped last year in the face of rowdy Occupy Oakland protesters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan, initially proposed by Council President Pat Kernighan and City Attorney Barbara Parker, would make it a misdemeanor to bring items to protests that could be used as weapons or for vandalism, such as clubs, wrenches, paint projectiles and firecrackers. The goal was to help police weed out agitators from groups of protesters before the protests got violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interim police Chief Sean Whent said Thursday the law might help officers as they deal with a fresh round of violent protests in the wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every tool in the tool basket has value,&quot; he said. &quot;The more opportunities we have to take enforcement action against people, the better it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whent, who met with downtown merchants Wednesday, also said police will &quot;dedicate all available resources&quot; to prevent additional vandalism during a protest planned for Saturday. All days off for police have been canceled this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drew Cribley, who was hit in the face with a hammer outside the restaurant Flora on Monday while trying to protect it from a vandal, said he would support the anti-weapon law. &quot;I think the only people who should have hammers in Oakland right now are the ones boarding up the buildings,&quot; he wrote in an email.Alexeis Filipello, who owns Bar Dogwood, also said the council needed to reconsider the law. &quot;I've seen so many people with huge hammers. It's shocking,&quot; said Filipello, whose business was vandalized during a Saturday protest and needed protection from its own customers Monday to prevent more damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law was proposed during the waning days of last year's Occupy protests, during which agitators often armed with hammers and spray cans would separate themselves from demonstrators late at night and scuffle with police and damage property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, there were concerns about whether the proposal would violate the rights of protesters and questions about how much it would help an undermanned police department because vandals could just keep the items in their bags.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the council didn't abandon the proposal until Occupiers marched on Kernighan's home and essentially took over the first and only debate on it last May at a Public Safety Committee meeting. Several cursed at Kernighan, and others hinted at violence if the measure were approved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests across the US that erupted in the wake of a Florida jury's acquittal of George Zimmerman over the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin have largely focused on race. The civil rights activists who are calling for justice have stirred passions, in some places sparking violence that could easily spin out of control. President Barack Obama has rightly called for calm and restraint. But words alone are not what Americans need. In a country so riven by race, despite the denials of many politicians, damage control and making streets safe to walk are what most matter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There can be no denying the racial elements to the case: an African-American shot dead on a rainy night 17 months ago in the name of self-defence by the son of a white father and Peruvian mother on the streets of a middle-class neighbourhood that had experienced a spate of robberies. Protesters allege racial profiling by the defendant and police and bias by the six-member jury, white bar one. But it was not the judge's job to help mend the US racial divide. Her role was to see that a fair trial was conducted, and, under Florida's laws, that is what happened. The decision was arrived at without a confession, scientific evidence or a definitive witness. Matters like the state's lenient gun laws, controversial self-defence legislation, the authority of vigilantes and whether race played a part were not factors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman may yet face federal prosecution or a wrongful- death civil action for damages by Martin's parents. Whether crucial details that have yet to be revealed would then come to light is debatable. But however the case evolves, it will not make Florida's cities safer, day or night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eliminating racism may never be possible. More constructive, then, is for Americans to focus on the attainable: ensuring that the streets of their cities are safe. Gun-toting citizens who appoint themselves law enforcers have no place. Laws in states like Florida that permit this must be changed to give police sole responsibility for protecting communities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT'S 1am and four of us are driving home after a show. What would have been a jolly mood is tainted by a heaviness that has laid siege to the conversation in the car. <BR> One voice is speaking softly on the phone. The conversation turns my blood into ice.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The voice is that of a father talking to his 12-year-old son. The son is scared. <BR> News that George Zimmerman was found not guilty of stalking and killing 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in the US broke two hours ago. <BR> The father is counselling his son and reinforcing the beauty of his blackness. <BR> At 12, the son has already experienced enough racism to feel scared and helpless at this news. The father keeps contradicting himself: &quot;Keep your feet on the ground and focus on your studies; don't draw unnecessary attention to yourself; comply with the law, but don't allow anyone to make you feel small.&quot; <BR> The father is planning to move to Costa Rica with his family, where his sons will grow up away from the cloud of racial profiling that hangs over the black man in America.<BR>  I remember during President Barack Obama's visit to South Africa, there were a lot of complaints about his bodyguards stopping and frisking black men. <BR> Nzinga Qunta sent a Tweet to the US Embassy of this travesty: &quot;We're not in the US. Please get your people to stop randomly harassing black men. We don't do that here&quot;.<BR> Imagine having to tell your 12-year-old son that the colour of his skin is a battleground. That his masculinity cements his oppression. <BR> My son is eight. He is beautiful and has an innocent charm that I want to preserve for as long as I can. He is aware that he is brown with nappy hair and that not all children look like him. Beyond that, he sees no other differences.<BR>  In the playground, race is not a factor. <BR> I am sure I will have to have a conversation about racism with my son at some point. It won't be because he experiences overt institutionalised racism, but because we still live in a racialised society. It won't be because the colour of his skin poses a mortal danger to his life, but because the colour of his skin might prevent him from getting THAT job. When racism is upheld by the state, it gives freedom to evil to perpetrate unspeakable atrocities without much fear of consequences. <BR> The conversation the father was having with his son is haunting me. I had to ask if it was that bad because it seemed ridiculous to me. I wanted to stop him and say people do not talk like that anymore, that the conversation belonged in the 1930s and in the times of lynchings. That the black and proud chant was no longer needed as the black man was now free to create his own destiny. <BR> Then, I remembered Martin, who is dead. I remembered that a few hours earlier, his killer was freed to roam the streets. He was found not guilty. <BR> I cannot bring myself to accept that the US, the land of the free, allows this to happen within its borders. Put aside criminalising black men; criminalising black children serves as more than just a human rights violation, it is an abortion of justice.<BR>  Had Martin been white ... I do not even have to finish this sentence. <BR> What gives me hope is that I know that Americans are fighters. They take nothing lying down. Every inch of freedom black Americans gained was hard earned. I know that they will fight for Martin until the end because their children's lives are at stake if they do not. They will petition, raise funds, march, do whatever they can do because evil reigns supreme when good people do nothing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are post-verdict protests warranted?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a young man back in the 1950s, I stood with my black brothers in picket lines and demonstrations, fighting for equal justice under the law, and against lynch mob rule. So I am very disappointed to see NAACP leaders now whipping up mob emotions against the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The George Zimmerman trial involved 200 exhibits, 84 photos, 38 prosecution witnesses, 18 defense witnesses, 14 days of testimony, and 16 hours of deliberations by a jury accepted by both prosecution and defense. The jury decided Zimmerman was not guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are the howling mobs better qualified to judge whether justice has been done?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JACK MALONEY, St. Paul</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; &middot; &middot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think the jury got it right in the Zimmerman trial, and by that I mean they followed the instruction given to them by the judge. I also think the legal system, not the jury, got it wrong. The prosecution did a poor job: It should have raised the language of the Florida statute (776.041) that says that use of force is not available to someone who initially provokes the use of force (which Zimmerman did by pursuing Trayvon Martin even after the police told him more than once not to). But what pushed me over the line is this: The Martin family is planning to file civil charges against Zimmerman. How many of us know that the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law in Florida says at 776.032 that if a person (i.e., Zimmerman) is given immunity under that law, then the other party (i.e., the Martins) may be ordered to pay that person's legal fees? Yup. As if losing a son were not enough, the Matins may actually end up paying money to the man who killed their son. Now if that is not a broken system worthy of protest, I don't know what is.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The device companies claim that the tax &quot;threatens medical innovation and jobs.&quot; Yet, the tax money will be used to support health care reform.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I agree with Omar Ishrak (the CEO of Medtronic) that tax reform is badly needed in the United States (&quot;Put federal tax reform on the state's wish list,&quot; July 12), I'm certainly beyond weary of multimillionaires complaining about taxes. The notion that if only we'd fix corporate taxes all would be well in the world for the rest of us - because we'd all reap the rewards - sounds eerily similar to &quot;trickle-down&quot; ideas of years ago. And those of us firmly in the middle class - or lower - surely wonder where all that bounty went to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not dismissing the need for reform - and that would involve considerations for the business community. But where reform is really needed is in the hearts and minds of all Americans - especially those who have benefited the most in our capitalistic system. That reform really begins with taking into account that our poorest, those who work for $20,000 to $30,000 per year, need our attention first. Then, let's look at how companies like Medtronic, who already enjoy a healthy &quot;bottom line,&quot; can do even better.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can't rely upon the market alone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe we must make it possible for more students to attend college, acquiring the skills and critical-thinking ability to join the middle class and sustain our democracy. I was once a low-income student, and because I graduated in 1963 with only $1,200 in loans, I was able to join the middle class and become a professional educator, teaching students from eighth grade through</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">graduate school. That's why I support Mike Obermueller for U.S. House in Minnesota's Second District in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, I believe that the federal government - not the market alone - should help to solve the current crisis in student loan debt. When the banks were in crisis, the government - that is, taxpayers - bailed them out. But now that student debt has reached $1 trillion, Laura Brod, a former state representative and current University of Minnesota regent who supports incumbent U.S. Rep. John Kline - believes that &quot;the market&quot; should solve the problem (Readers Write, July 13). I disagree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Obermueller points out (Readers Write, July 7), under Kline's proposal, student loans would become more expensive, making it impossible for low-income students to attend college. Kline's plan also creates greater uncertainty for borrowers about the total cost of their loans and fails to include additional help for students struggling to repay their loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also find it disturbing that Kline's major campaign contributions come from for-profit schools, because, as U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa has shown, many of these schools are exploiting their students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRENDA DALY, Burnsville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; &middot; &middot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish that Brod or Kline or someone would explain why it would be advantageous to base student loan interest rates on the market when that raises the very real possibility that students might be faced with rates even higher than the dreaded 6.8 percent. Of course, they may get lower rates - it all depends on whether the market goes up or down. Do we really want to tie educational opportunity to something as volatile and capricious as a market?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO -- For some Americans anguished by the Saturday night acquittal of George Zimmerman, the remedy appears obvious: The U.S. Department of Justice should mount its own criminal case, and prosecute Zimmerman for violating civil rights or hate crimes statutes in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument has appeal. Federal laws allow prosecutors to make broader arguments, citing broader federal priorities, than does the typical state murder or manslaughter law, more narrowly tailored to adjudicating who caused whose death, and why. Justice at times has won convictions on these federal grounds after courts have acquitted defendants accused of violating local or state laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, it's often difficult to use federal prosecution to right an alleged wrong done in a state court. More important, the federal statutes are a poor fit for the circumstances of the Zimmerman case and how it played out in Florida. Given those circumstances, it's all but inconceivable that prosecutors could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Martin's race provoked Zimmerman's activity. Nor should they try.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal civil rights and hate crimes statutes evolved, and achieved their prominence and respect, because localities and states egregiously had failed to follow their own protocols for delivering criminal justice. With intentionally shoddy investigations, weak prosecutions and other inadequate efforts, some local and state officials didn't properly pursue criminal cases because of a victim's race, color, religion or nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In such cases, Justice today can insert itself as the designated and well-resourced provocateur. Our national interest in equal justice under law permits this federal intervention into what may originate as local cases born of local crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman case doesn't meet that test. Each of us can agree or disagree with the jury's verdict. And critics can say local police were slow to probe the complexities of the case. But as the prosecution's evidence attested at trial, the investigation was extra- ordinarily elaborate. Like the rest of the nation, the defendant -- and the victim's family -- witnessed a fair and open trial. And the prosecutors' suggestion that Zimmerman had acted out of &quot;ill will&quot; or &quot;hatred&quot; or &quot;spite&quot; didn't convince jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those jurors had limited options when they declared Zimmerman not guilty. But by rejecting murder and manslaughter convictions, they in essence declared Zimmerman innocent by reason of self- defense -- a crucial point that goes to the heart of the decision on whether Justice now should attempt to prosecute him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors spent weeks hearing the best evidence prosecutors could produce against Zimmerman, yet didn't declare him in the wrong or ill-motivated. Ron Safer, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in Chicago, notes that in a subsequent federal trial, &quot;the prosecution would have the added burden to prove racial animus. It can't be assumed; it has to be proved.&quot; Yet federal investigators who interviewed dozens of Zimmerman's friends, neighbors and co-workers reportedly found no one who thought he was a racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes federal intervention does make sense. The feds successfully prosecuted two Los Angeles police officers for beating Rodney King in 1991 after they had been acquitted in a state trial. But there was extensive video footage of that episode, and the cops were convicted of violating King's rights &quot;under color of law&quot; -- a category that applies only to law enforcement, which Zimmerman was not. Even so, two of the four officers acquitted in the original trial were acquitted in federal court as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most comprehensive summation we've read of why Justice shouldn't interject itself here comes from Florida federal defense attorney Scott Srebnick. &quot;If the state jury had been persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman caused bodily harm to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because of Martin's race, it would have almost certainly convicted Zimmerman of second-degree murder, which requires proof of 'ill-will' or 'malice,' &quot; Srebnick told the Miami Herald. &quot;So, to bring a federal civil rights prosecution against Zimmerman, the attorney general would essentially be second-guessing the state jury's verdict as opposed to vindicating a different or broader federal interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this highly visible and racially charged case, the acquittal of George Zimmerman is bound to frustrate many people. But barring decisive new information, the Florida jury's decision ought to be the last word.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The controversially concluded Florida murder trial of George Zimmerman has prompted fresh debate over whether &quot;stand your ground&quot; self-defense laws hinder violence or, perversely, propel it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence appears mixed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some studies show enhanced public safety. Others suggest the opposite. One study concluded that several dozen men a month are killed as a consequence of the laws. In a speech this week, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder showed himself to be among the skeptics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resulting ambiguity, like the Zimmerman trial itself, in which he was found not guilty of murdering 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, may confound anyone hoping for a neutral finding of fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's good that whatever perspective you take is based on data, and not just anecdotes,&quot; Miami-based attorney Leigh-Ann Buchanan said in an interview on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buchanan is a co-chair of an American Bar Association task force that's studying stand-your-ground laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, Holder joined those who assert that the stand-your-ground laws make matters worse. Addressing the NAACP on Tuesday in Orlando, Fla., he declared that the laws may &quot;contribute to more violence than they prevent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By allowing and perhaps encouraging violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety,&quot; the nation's top law enforcement officer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general thrust of such laws is to remove the long-standing legal &quot;duty to retreat&quot; in the face of danger while in a public place. Instead, individuals may defend themselves, with lethal force if necessary, so long as they are in the public place legally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's attorneys didn't specifically raise the stand-your-ground law as a defense against second-degree murder charges in the February 2012 death of Martin. The trial judge, though, did refer to the &quot;right to stand your ground,&quot; under certain circumstances, in her instructions to the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, two Georgia State University economics researchers concluded that the laws are &quot;associated with a significant increase in the number of homicides among whites, especially white males.&quot; In a 55-page paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, authors Chandler McClellan and Erdal Tekin estimated that &quot;between 28 and 33 additional white males are killed each month&quot; as a result of these laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These laws are also associated with a significant increase in emergency room visits and hospital discharges related to firearm-inflicted injuries,&quot; the Georgia State economists said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas A&amp;M researchers Mark Hoekstra and Cheng Cheng reached similar conclusions last year in a 43-page study that found a &quot;statistically significant 8 percent net increase in the number of reported murders and non-negligent manslaughters&quot; in states with the enhanced self-defense laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases, though, the resulting violence is considered justified. In these cases, advocates say, the laws result in a safer society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private citizens committed 196 justifiable homicides nationwide in 2005, the year states began crafting stand-your-ground laws, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting system. The FBI defines justifiable homicide as &quot;the killing of a felon, during the commission of a felony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 2011, the number of reported justifiable homicides had jumped to 260.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 5000 African-American men were shot and murdered in the United States last year. A similar number have been murdered almost every year for decades. Yet few if any demonstrations against this shocking waste of life have been seen on the streets of America. It was different this week, when street demonstrations and public outrage flared across the country after a jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of either murder or manslaughter for shooting and killing 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Context, it appears, is everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Americans expected a not-guilty verdict in this trial, which has attracted enormous media coverage for months. A national poll taken last year found that only 24 per cent of respondents believed Zimmerman was guilty. Even fewer, 20 per cent, thought he would be convicted. So it has turned out. The outrage felt by many is driven by a combination of facts: Zimmerman is Hispanic and his victim was African-American, unarmed, had no criminal record and was walking towards the home where he was staying. Even though the evidence at trial established that Zimmerman did not set out to shoot Martin and did so only after they had been involved in a fight, the circumstances have proved combustible. The main reason is simple - race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contributing to the outrage is Florida's &quot;justifiable use of force&quot; statute, which states, inter alia: &quot;A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The existence of this law gave the jury the discretion to treat Zimmerman's actions as legal if it concluded he believed he was in danger of suffering great bodily harm. In theory, with the number of guns in private hands rising, and numerous state laws giving people the right to shoot without having to retreat from harm, there should be an increase in fatal shootings. Mercifully, the trend is in the opposite direction, down, not up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should be thankful that such cases are rare, given that about 300 million guns are in private hands in America, the largest civilian arsenal in history. Given, too, that the US is a mosaic of different races, the amount of inter-racial homicide is very low in the context of an armed and multiracial nation. The trend in the nation's murder rate is down and has been trending down for a decade. In 2011, the homicide rate was 4.7 per 100,000 population, the lowest in 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, too, requires context. The per capita homicide rate in the US is almost five times greater than the rate in Australia, and the rate of homicides involving firearms is exponentially higher - about 10,000 a year in the US compared with about 30 in Australia. The reason for the wild divergence in per capita homicide rates involving firearms - 3.2 per 100,000 people in the US compared with just 0.1 in Australia - is America's gun culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gun advocates in the US are arguing that the decline in the homicide rate combined with the rise in gun ownership proves that an armed population can be a safer population. But two-thirds of murders in the US involve firearms whereas they are involved in only a small fraction of homicides in the rest of the developed world. If Americans were not so heavily armed, and American culture not so drenched in an ethos of gun justice, tens of thousands of young men, especially African-American men, would not have their lives cut short and incidents like the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would be more rare and less justifiable under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America is in the middle of a race debate and a debate over self-defence, but these are symptoms of a deeper social dysfunction, an ingrained culture of bearing arms when confronting trouble.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tom Sowell col.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no winners in the trial of George Zimmerman. The only question is whether the damage that has been done has been transient or irreparable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legally speaking, Zimmerman has won his freedom. But he can still be sued in a civil case, and he will probably never be safe to live his life in peace, as he could have before this case made him the focus of national attention and orchestrated hate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important than the fate of George Zimmerman, however, is the fate of the American justice system and of the public's faith in that system and in their country. People who have increasingly asked, during the lawlessness of the Obama administration, Is this still America? may feel some measure of relief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the very fact that this case was brought in the first place, in an absence of serious evidence - which became ever more painfully obvious as the prosecution strained to try to come up with anything worthy of a murder trial - will be of limited encouragement as to how long this will remain America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political perversion of the criminal justice system began early and at the top, with the President of the United States. Unlike other public officials who decline to comment on criminal cases that have not yet been tried in court, Barack Obama chose to say, If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a clever way to play the race card, as he had done before, when Professor Henry Louis Gates of Harvard was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it did not stop there. After the local police in Florida found insufficient evidence to ask for Zimmerman to be prosecuted, the Obama administration sent Justice Department investigators to Sanford, Florida, and also used the taxpayers' money to finance local activists who agitated for Zimmerman to be arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political intervention did not end with the federal government. The city manager in Sanford intervened to prevent the usual police procedures from being followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the question arose of identifying the voice of whoever was calling for help during the confrontation between Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and George Zimmerman, the normal police procedure would have been to let individuals hear the recording separately, rather than have a whole family hear it together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you want to get each individual's honest opinion, you don't want that opinion to be influenced by others who are present, much less allow a group to coordinate what they are going to say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the city manager took this out of the hands of the police and had Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family, plus Rachel Jeantel, all hear the recording together, that's politics, not law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was just one of the ways that this case looked like something out of Alice in Wonderland. Both in the courtroom and in the media, educated and apparently intelligent people repeatedly said things that they seemed sincerely, and even fervently, to believe, but which were unprovable and often even unknowable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the testimony of prosecution witness after prosecution witness undermined the prosecution's own case. Some critics faulted the prosecuting attorneys. But the prosecutors had to work with what they had - and they had no hard evidence that would back up a murder charge or even a manslaughter charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You don't send people to prison on the basis of what other people imagine, or on the basis of media sound bites like shooting an unarmed child, when that child was beating him bloody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury indicated, early on as their deliberations began, that they wanted to compare hard evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the issue boiled down to hard, provable facts, the prosecutors' loud histrionic assertions and sweeping innuendoes were just not going to cut it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only real heroes in this trial were the jurors. They showed that this is still America - at least for now - despite politicians who try to cheapen or corrupt the law, as if this were some banana republic. Some are already calling for a federal indictment of George Zimmerman, after he has been acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will this still be America then?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was an unarmed teenager walking home from a convenience store with Skittles and iced tea, when he was shot to death by a racist, profiling wannabe cop named George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Big Media, which has relentlessly sought out the voices of those most incensed by the verdict in Sanford, Fla., that is how the Saga of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is being told. And from listening to TV reports of the rage across black America, that is what is widely believed there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But is that what happened? Well, not exactly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was not shot while walking home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was shot after sucker-punching George Zimmerman, breaking his nose, knocking him down, jumping on top of him, beating him martial arts style and banging his head on a concrete walk, while Zimmerman screamed again and again, Help me, help me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what George Zimmerman said happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is what the sole eyewitness to the fight, John Good, says happened. It is what Sanford police believed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is what the defense proved beyond a reasonable doubt. It is what that jury of six women came to believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why, then, do so many in the black community believe Trayvon was profiled and murdered, when even most of the analysts on the cable news shows were saying in the last days of the trial that the prosecution had failed completely to make its case?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer: Many had convicted George Zimmerman in their hearts before the trial began. Here, as this writer noted a year ago, are some of the voices that had declared Zimmerman guilty of murder before a witness had been called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Blacks are under attack, railed Jesse Jackson. Killing us is big business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''A hate crime, said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., said Trayvon had been executed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And President Obama? Did he calm the waters? Hardly. He signaled whose side he was on. If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only did they all inflame the black community into believing a racist atrocity had occurred, others still do so, even after the weeks of testimony that raised far more than a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four-term mayor of Washington, D.C., Marion Barry, said the Zimmerman verdict was awful, another example of institutionalized racism. But look to Marion to find a bright side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The good news is that Zimmerman will never be in peace. He won't be able to get a job. He'll have to go underground, travel incognito and never live in peace. That's the good news for me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who turned this neighborhood watch fellow, well-liked by all in his community, into some racist monster?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night of the verdict, Mark O'Mara gave America the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George didn't know why he was turned into a monster, O'Mara told the assembled journalists. But quite honestly, you guys had a lot to do with it. You took a story that was fed to you, and you ran with it, and you ran right over him, and that was horrid to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like his partner Don West, O'Mara exhibited moral courage in that post-verdict press conference, as did that jury of six women, who rejected the prosecution's pleas to at least give them manslaughter or child abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama might now exhibit a little moral courage of his own, by directing his Justice Department to halt this scavenger hunt for a hate crime. If Sanford police and the FBI could not find a hate crime, and the prosecution could not prove racial profiling or malice, what reason is there to believe any such motive ever existed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Barack Obama and Eric Holder capitulate to Al Sharpton's demand for Plan B and the NAACP's demand for a second trial of George Zimmerman for a crime of which he has been acquitted, most Americans will come to believe this is no search for justice, but a drive for racial retribution and revenge. And they will be right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">End this persecution of George Zimmerman, Mr. President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shut it down.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right decision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest and prosecution of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was suspect from the very beginning. The Sanford police had investigated the incident and were satisfied that the provisions of Florida's Stand Your Ground law had been met for not arresting Zimmerman. However, after 44 days, owing to demonstrations, civil rights outcries and political pressure, a special prosecutor, without benefit of a grand jury inquiry, took it upon herself to bring a charge of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At best, the charge of manslaughter could have been envisioned and perhaps proved winnable in court, but the prosecution all but assured itself defeat by going after a higher and more difficult charge. Even then, attempting to convince the jury that Zimmerman killed Martin without lawful justification would have in hindsight proved to be unsustainable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, the jury saw through the vagueness of this case, particularly the so-called state of Zimmerman's mind at the time of the fatal clash with Martin. Barring eyewitness accounts and hard evidence, the jury apparently felt that there was insufficient proof to convict Zimmerman. This was the right decision in light of what had transpired long before the case was brought to trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earl A. Myers Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tampa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Change gun laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gun laws  be changed. Nobody should be able to shoot and kill another man because they have the law on their side. If George Zimmerman wasn't allowed to carry a gun, this kid would be alive and be in jail for assault and been able to go on with his life after learning that you can't beat a guy for stupid reasons. I hate this verdict, but I understand the result of the jury. This kid shouldn't have died, and Zimmerman should have not been carrying a gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can expect this kind of thing to happen more and more. I wonder why cops are allowed to shoot as well. A cop shot my bother to death on Father's Day a little less than a month ago. My brother didn't deserve this, either. Nobody should be allowed to kill. What will it take to make the laws be changed? How many people have to die for stupid mistakes? It seems like people want to shoot first and ask questions later. God help us all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tampa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's move on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After seeing the photographs, reading the Tribune articles and especially hearing the vitriolic tirade by Jesse Jackson on Fox News regarding the Martin-Zimmerman verdict, I submit the black community needs to get rid of the collective chip on its shoulder. The first step should be to lose the incessant use of the term African-American. If you were born in the United States, you are American. If you were born in Africa and hold dual citizenship, then you might qualify as an African-American. The use of that term is divisive and tends to foster an us-versus-them attitude that encourages the racial profiling you say you don't like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I suggest that the black community stop calling racial any issue with which you don't agree. The verdict was not guilty. Does that make it racial, or is it a determination based on evidence presented by both the defense and the prosecution? Calling Zimmerman a murderer on national TV after he has been found innocent in a fair and lawful trial does nothing but encourage the us-versus-them mentality. Is there prejudice? Yes. Does that make everything racial? No. And trying to make it so just exacerbates the reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just to let you know, I am a Cherokee-black-white American, but American will do quite nicely. Maybe others would benefit from the same philosophy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sun City Center</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Avoiding violence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your editorial on Monday regarding the verdict in the George Zimmerman case (The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict, Our views) is fair and representative of the facts, until the last sentence. You state: Zimmerman may not have committed a crime, but he caused a tragedy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe there is equal responsibility on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Martin had taken the time to find out what Zimmerman wanted and told him he was going to see his father in unit such-and-such, I am quite sure Zimmerman would have driven away satisfied with the explanation. Young men confronted by authority figures in a situation they feel is no one's business but their own many times resort to confrontation rather than seeking an amiable solution. In a lot of cases, confrontations soon escalate to violence, and in this case it resulted in death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who can blame Zimmerman for wanting to keep his neighborhood safe? He may have overstepped his bounds slightly, but this was not cause for physical retaliation by Martin. A little common courtesy by both sides in these minor disputes would go a long way to resolving small problems before they become big ones.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estefania Galvis sat on the floor of the state Capitol on Tuesday, her homemade banner spread out before her: End Racial Oppression, Justice 4 Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Galvis, a 22-year-old University of South Florida student, was one of more than 100 protesters staging a sit-in Tuesday in Gov. Rick Scott's reception area at the Capitol. Scott was out of town.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest was sparked by the not-guilty verdict Saturday in the trial of George Zimmerman, charged with shooting and killing 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last year.On Tuesday, Galvis wore a black hoodie, a symbol of the movement. Martin was wearing a hooded sweatshirt the night he was killed. She and others want Scott to call a special legislative session on vigilantism, racial profiling and a war on youth and to repeal the state's stand your ground law, according to a flier being handed out by organizers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not going to happen, said Scott's spokeswoman, who said the governor's heart goes out to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family and all those affected by his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are grateful that people across our great nation have the right to assemble and share their views, said Melissa Sellers, Scott's communications director. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She pointed out that Scott called a bipartisan special task force to review the stand your ground law after Martin's death. That law, which grants a right to respond to an attack with deadly force, was not at issue in the criminal trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task force recommended that the law should not be overturned, and Gov. Scott agrees, Sellers said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Galvis countered that the system needs to be pressured to bring justice, not only for Trayvon, but for all black and brown youth in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a community-watch volunteer, shot the unarmed Martin during a February 2012 confrontation in a gated community in Sanford. Martin, who was visiting his father, was returning from a convenience store after buying iced tea and Skittles candy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A struggle ensued, and Zimmerman said he fired a handgun in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A six-member, female jury acquitted Zimmerman of all charges in Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of Tuesday's protesters were part of a college-age group called the Dream Defenders that grew out of the Occupy movement. Another gathering of about 200 protested outside the old Capitol late Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the organizers of Dream Defenders, Ciara Taylor, made news last year by shouting down then-Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll as Carroll gave the keynote address for Florida A&amp;M University's black history month convocation.Steven Pargett, the group's spokesman, said members will stay as long as they have to for Scott to get their message, even if that means sleeping on the floor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're willing to wait, Pargett said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Swearingen, director of the Capitol Police, said protesters will be allowed to stay overnight in the Capitol, provided they don't leave the first floor, where the Governor's Office is located. Restrooms are available on that level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, because the Capitol is closed to the public from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m., protesters won't be able to re-enter if they leave. Officers patrol the building and grounds around the clock. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I accept the Zimmerman verdict, as all of us must. But I see a distinction between a moral wrong and a legal wrong. There are lots of morally wrong things you can do without breaking the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe George Zimmerman was wrong to take a gun on his neighborhood watch tour, even if he was legally entitled to. I believe Zimmerman was wrong to assume that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was up to no good. I believe Zimmerman was wrong to act on his police wanna-be ambitions to follow Martin, even after the dispatcher suggested he needn't do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we accept Zimmerman's story that Martin attacked him first - as the jury did - then Martin was wrong to lay a hand on him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each man felt justified in what he did. It's tragic that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's one alleged miscalculation was the only illegal one, and he ended up dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So while I understand the strict legal arguments that kept Zimmerman out of prison, I also wish some of his defenders could understand the larger social and moral dimensions of this case -- and why many Americans, not just black ones, feel overcome with sadness if not outrage. A black boy who was minding his own business is dead. And the man who put himself into a position where he had to kill him is free. He'll have to live with that. So will we.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a member of Trinity Presbyterian Church and a resting elder, I am appalled that the myth continues to be perpetuated that the Rev. Dennis Reid &quot;withheld money&quot; from the Nugent family. Anyone who knows Presbyterian polityknows that the session of the church is responsible for decisions regarding finances. It was the session that needed time to review the contents of the trusts that were set up for Ireland and the Nugents. It was the session that, in its wisdom, reconvened less than 48 hours after the misinformation hit the media so that it could take action and move the money entrusted to the church to those trusts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the church that sent hundreds of thank-you notes to everyone who contributed to Ireland, all hand-signed by Dennis. He encouraged the church to support the family in its time of need, and he spent countless hours at the family's side during the first months of Ireland's recovery. Individual church members contributed large amounts of money and time to help the family through this trauma. The staff and volunteers went above and beyond to make sure that all contributions were documented and deposited in a timely manner for safekeeping until logistics could be in place to create the trusts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think all of us thought that race did not play a role.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Juror B37,on the deliberations in the trial of George Zimmerman, who was found not guilty in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so this latest case about race in America ends, to the dismay but maybe not the surprise of many, with an acquittal of the neighborhood watch volunteer who targeted the kid he thought was up to no good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman is officially not guilty in the utterly pointless shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, who had the bad luck to walk through a gated community in the Florida town of Sanford after buying Skittles at a corner convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of the verdict, some who see Zimmerman as an overzealous cop-wanna-be who assumed Martin was trouble because he was young, black, male and there, are looking to federal authorities for another chance to convict him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP, among others, wants the Justice Department to pursue civil rights charges - another bite of the apple, as they say in court. You can understand in the heat of this case why. But it's not how our justice system - however flawed - is supposed to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was important for the world to hear this week from a juror, identified only as B37 because of the high emotion surrounding this, on what logic led them to decide Zimmerman was guilty of neither second-degree murder nor manslaughter. (It was less good to hear an initial report that this same juror planned to write a book, this being America where no exploitation is too outrageous, though she later said she would not.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manslaughter - committing an act that ultimately causes a death - seemed to me the more appropriate charge. But the juror told CNN's Anderson Cooper she believed that in the confrontation between the two, the teenager was the one who was on the attack and who threw the first punch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said nearly every juror believed it was Zimmerman who could be heard screaming on the 911 call. She had &quot;no doubt George feared for his life&quot; in those last moments. And she believed his motive had to do with vandalism in the neighborhood, not race. &quot;It just went terribly wrong,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if you disagree vehemently, it's important to know what jurors saw in that courtroom. They were there for every minute of it. They saw each piece of evidence and heard every nuance of what witnesses and lawyers and the judge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That evidence is unlikely to change, much less get better, for federal prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does anyone think there is a single stone unturned, a witness we haven't heard, a piece of evidence unseen, in a case America cares this much about?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember, the federal government did not opt to pursue a civil rights charge against Zimmerman when this happened, even as the president himself was saying if he had a son, he would look like Trayvon. They left it to the state courts, and we have the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal jury would have to find this was motivated by race. A state juror says the way they saw it, it wasn't. So say we all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's how it works. That's our system of justice, even when the results seem like something far from it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't press send!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what former NFL head coach Herm Edwards says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coach-turned-ESPN-analyst speaks to incoming NFL rookies each year and talks about his dream of inventing a smart phone that would be smart enough to replace the &quot;send'' button with a &quot;don't press send'' button.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So when you tweet all that stuff out and you get ready to send it out, it will say, oh, Don't Press Send,'' Edwards tells the rookies. &quot;That's so you can think about what you're getting ready to press.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far too many athletes these days are pushing send before thinking about what they are saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I ran a pro sports team, or even a college program, I would forbid my athletes from using Twitter. And this is just a guess, but you watch: In the not-so-distant future, practically every pro and college team in the country will prohibit its players from using the social media site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has become too dangerous and simply not worth the risk for teams to endure the public embarrassment of reprimanding then apologizing for players who can't help but have a brain cramp in fewer than 140 characters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First of all, let's get one thing straight: As a sportswriter, I love that athletes use Twitter. It lets all of us know what they are thinking and doing, although I believe I would sleep just fine without the knowledge that Redskins backup quarterback Kirk Cousins thinks Home Alone is a great movie. (Yeah, he really did tweet that.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I, especially, love that many who use Twitter don't have that edit chip between their brains and their fingers. I love that they press &quot;send'' without thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the time, it's harmless stuff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the time Ohio State quarterback Cardale Jones tweeted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why should we have to go to class if we came here to play FOOTBALL, we ain't come to play SCHOOL classes are POINTLESS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's sad and maybe even a bit insightful to see the honest feelings of college athletes, as well as their total lack of grammar skills. But, ultimately, no harm is being done here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Same as when Texas A&amp;M quarterback Johnny Manziel - who, by the way, seems intent on becoming the Lindsay Lohan of college football - tweeted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Expletive) like tonight is a reason why I can't wait to leave college station...whenever it may be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often times, Twitter is used to criticize someone or start a feud, such as when U.S. women's soccer goalie Hope Solo was all in a huff when former U.S. women's star Brandi Chastain criticized the Americans while calling a game for ESPN. Solo tweeted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its 2 bad we cant have commentators who better represents the team &amp; knows more about the game</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Occasionally, players will step over the line of good taste or common sense, like when Rashard Mendenhall, then with the Steelers, reacted to Americans celebrating the death of Osama bin Laden by tweeting:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What kind of person celebrates death? It's amazing how people can HATE a man they have never even heard speak. We've only heard one side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was followed by:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll never know what really happened. I just have a hard time believing a plane could take a skyscraper down demolition style</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Usually, within a few hours, these athletes have to send out some sort of apology that appears to have been written by someone with a college degree in public relations. It uses words like &quot;thoughtless'' and &quot;insensitive.'' It talks about having &quot;regret'' then closes with the obligatory, although often insincere-sounding, &quot;I apologize to anyone who might have been offended by my comments.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past week, many athletes were swept up in the aftermath of George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. The Giants' Victor Cruz tweeted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman doesn't last a year before the hood catches up with him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falcons wide receiver Roddy White suggested the jurors in the case should &quot;kill themselves.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A short time later, White tweeted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's crazy how people on twitter want me to get in trouble for a tweet that they are retweeting because they want something to happen thanks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, Cruz and White apologized for their remarks, saying they were made hastily in reaction to being stunned by Zimmerman being found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fair enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, virtually every ill-advised, apologetic or just plain dumb tweet typed out by an athlete is the result of a hastily slapped-together response to subjects that are probably best left alone. There are people who write for a living who don't make anything public until it is read by several editors, yet athletes will send out something without even reading it back themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it's certainly Cruz's right to talk about the Zimmerman trial and while Mendenhall is entitled to have an opinion on bin Laden, they shouldn't confuse freedom of speech with freedom from consequences. Sometimes it's just better to say nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, in other words, you can never go wrong by following these three words:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't Press Send.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Skaters and black community leaders each claim to have history on their side.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Squaring off on a downtown street corner Tuesday, the two sides shouted, pointed fingers and accused each other of being insensitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One side waved signs. The other shot video. A police helicopter circled overhead. Close by, a couple of officers watched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, no, the protest had nothing to do with Trayvon Martin or George Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The yelling was generational. The history was local. And the focus of everyone's anger was the future of a graffiti-splotched skateboard park known as the &quot;Bro Bowl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On one side stood black community leaders old enough to remember the 1950s and '60s heyday of Central Avenue, the area where the Bro Bowl sits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Settled by freed slaves in 1864, Central Avenue grew into a lively black business and entertainment district before being bulldozed for urban renewal. Cab Calloway, Ella Fitzgerald, James Brown, Ray Charles and B.B. King played nightclubs there. Hank Ballard wrote The Twist, a hit for Chubby Checker, after watching Central Avenue kids dance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side were skaters, both black and white but decades younger, who say the Bro Bowl is an iconic skate park - popular video games re-create the experience of skating it - and is historic in its own right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tampa City Hall, with support of the black community, plans to demolish the Bro Bowl and build a bigger skate park nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan is part of a $6.5 million makeover at Perry Harvey Sr. Park, which has its own place in Tampa history. It was created at the request of black youth after riots in 1967 sparked by the police shooting of a black teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the renovated park, the city plans features honoring Central Avenue's history on the spot where the Bro Bowl sits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only that, but the effort is part of the 29-acre Encore Tampa urban redevelopment project. Last year, Encore won a $30 million federal grant, some of which is earmarked for the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So officials and black leaders say the Bro Bowl has to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it was somewhere else, that might be fine, but not on this ground,&quot; said retired city official Fred Hearns, who chaired a citizens advisory committee on plans for the park. &quot;Everything on this site should honor Central Avenue and the people who lived here, worked here and the slaves who settled here. If it doesn't honor that, it doesn't belong here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrating at the park Tuesday, both sides were passionate but peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're destroying our history, okay?&quot; yelled skater Nick Leon, 34, of Tampa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 63-year-old Dan Coleman shouted, &quot;I was here 50 years ago - 50 years ago! I! Was! Here!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an effort to save the Bro Bowl, skateboarders have petitioned to put the 35-year-old concrete basin on the National Register of Historic Places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Tampa's Historic Preservation Commission voted to recommend approval after skateboarder Shannon Bruffett presented video testimony on the Bro Bowl's historic significance from members of the Skateboarding Hall of Fame and historians from as far away as London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, they said, one of just three remaining U.S. skate parks from the late 1970s and early 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruffett was not at Tuesday's demonstration but said that, because of its location in Perry Harvey Sr. Park, the Bro Bowl is &quot;an element of Central Avenue, not separate from it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's kind of a landmark in a few ways,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next week, a state review board is scheduled to hold a public hearing in Tallahassee on Bruffett's petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the state finds that the skate park meets the criteria - and yes, something less than 50 years old could qualify if it were deemed &quot;exceptionally important&quot; - the petition would go to Washington, D.C., for a final decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides plan to be in Tallahassee. Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn and Tampa City Council member Frank Reddick have written the state opposing the designation of the Bro Bowl. If necessary, Hearns said he'll take his case to Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we have to go to D.C., I'll book my flight,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tweets on Sunday, July 14th, 2013 in tweets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE RULING: MOSTLY FALSE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of George Zimmerman, a white Hispanic, in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a black teenager, has prompted commentary from the left and right about race and murder statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We saw this statistic repeated multiple times by conservatives on Twitter after the July 13 verdict: &quot;In the 513 days between Trayvon dying, and today's verdict, 11,106 African-Americans have been murdered by other African-Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will leave it up to others to interpret the relevance of such statistics in the Zimmerman trial or other cases. Our role here as fact-checkers is to examine the numbers and their context. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quick note on the case before we turn to the numbers: Hispanic is an ethnicity -- someone can be Hispanic and white, as in Zimmerman's case -- or Hispanic and black. The crime data we reviewed generally focused on whites and blacks, though it sometimes included a generic &quot;other&quot; category.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was unarmed when he got into a scuffle with Zimmerman in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26, 2012. A jury acquitted Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer whose lawyer argued self-defense, of second-degree murder and manslaughter. (Read our fact-checks that relate to the case and Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistic about blacks killed during course of Trayvon case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found the claim about murders on the conservative soopermexican blog; it appears to have originated there. We emailed the blogger and didn't get a response, but his blog walks readers through the math on getting to 11,106 deaths in 513 days. (We counted 503 days, not 513, but that's a tiny quibble.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blogger, citing an earlier blog post and The Blaze, stated that there were 8,000 to 9,000 African-Americans killed each year -- 93 percent of them by African-Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The numbers came from a 2007 U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report, which stated that blacks were victims of 7,999 homicides in 2005 and said that 93 percent were killed by people who shared their race. (It wasn't clear to us where the blogger's 9,000 figure came from.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using the number 8,500, that translated to 21.65 blacks murdered each day by other blacks. So the blogger came up with a mathematical formula: 21.65 times 513 days=11,106. That 8,500 figure seems high, though, especially if we look at more recent figures. The FBI reported for 2011 that 6,329 black people were murdered, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blog post makes it sound as if the black-on-black murder rate is particularly significant, but we found similar high percentages for whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also stated that 85 percent of white victims in single-victim and single-offender homicides were murdered by someone of their race. So that means the majority of black and white people are murdered by someone of their own race. In 2005, there were 8,017 white homicide victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race victim/offender data isn't shown for every case: It is only shown in the cases in which the race was known (some murders are never solved) and in cases involving a single victim and defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We sent a summary of our findings to the soopermexican blogger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think your criticism of the number I arrived at has some merit,&quot; he wrote in an email. &quot;I should have made it more clear that is the best extrapolation from the numbers that are available. While the FBI stats don't include all known cases, I don't see why the cases where race stats are known shouldn't be representative of the entire class of murders. Yes, it's true that murder rates have come down generally, which I'm pretty sure applies to all race/ethnic classes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for white-on-white homicides also representing a high percentage, he said the point he was trying to make is that it's wrong to suggest that &quot;white racism is killing blacks disproportionately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What homicide-race stats show about our relationships</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So statistics show that most murders in which the race can be measured are intraracial. We wanted to know why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We interviewed Professor David M. Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homicides overwhelmingly happen among people who know each other,&quot; he said. &quot;There are relatively few absolutely straight-up stranger homicides. Homicide is a phenomenon of social networks. ... Most peoples' relationships are primarily with someone of their own race or ethnicity. As long as anybody has studied homicide, this has been the pattern.&quot; (See the historical data.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writer Jamelle Bouie in The Daily Beast wrote a response to conservatives who have been trying to shift the conversation to black-on-black crime while ignoring that the same shared racial identity holds true for white-on-white crime, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bouie wrote that what is missing from the conversation about crime is that &quot;it's driven by opportunism and proximity; If African-Americans are more likely to be robbed, or injured, or killed by other African-Americans, it's because they tend to live in the same neighborhoods as each other. Residential statistics bear this out (PDF); blacks are still more likely to live near each other or other minority groups than they are to whites. And of course, the reverse holds as well-whites are much more likely to live near other whites than they are to minorities and African-Americans in particular.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the Zimmerman case, social media repeated this claim: &quot;In the 513 days between Trayvon dying, and today's verdict, 11,106 African-Americans have been murdered by other African-Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some who are citing this statistic are using it to portray race as an overemphasized point in the Zimmerman trial. We're not evaluating that opinion; we're fact-checking the math based on the available data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number sounds extremely precise, but it's actually something of a rough guess based on back-of-the envelope math. No one actually knows how many African-Americans were murdered by other African-Americans in that time frame, and the numbers cited are actually an extrapolation of murder statistics for 2005. More current figures from 2011 show fewer deaths. So the specific numbers are not literally accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, this claim lacks important context. Yes, it's true that the majority of black murder victims are murdered by blacks, but the same holds true for whites: Most whites are murdered by whites. And in both cases, this race statistic is not available for all murders, but only ones where the race of both perpetrator and victim can be determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim contains an element of truth, but it's not fully accurate. We rate this claim Mostly False.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glee actor Cory Monteith died of an overdose of heroin and alcohol, the British Columbia coroner's office said Tuesday. &quot;There is no evidence to suggest Mr. Monteith's death was anything other than a most tragic accident,&quot; the office said in a statement. The 31-year-old was found dead in his Vancouver, British Columbia, hotel room on Saturday, after he didn't check out on time. He was believed to be alone when he died.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Monteith had been out with people earlier, but video and electronic records from the hotel indicated he returned to his room by himself early Saturday. Monteith's death recalled the lives of Heath Ledger, Corey Haim and River Phoenix - actors who battled substance abuse and died in their 20s and 30s. Monteith had talked bluntly about struggling with addiction since he was a teenager, calling it a serious problem and telling Parade magazine in 2011 he was &quot;lucky to be alive.&quot; Monteith admitted himself to a treatment facility in April for substance addiction, a representative said at the time. He also received treatment when he was 19. Gia Milani, who recently produced and directed a Canadian film featuring Monteith, this week said he &quot;seemed healthy&quot; when she last saw him four weeks ago in Los Angeles. &quot;He looked super fit and he was energetic and excited,&quot; Milani said. She said Monteith showed no signs of a substance abuse problem while shooting the film a year ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Want to see Stevie Wonder perform in Florida again? Better write your congressman. In the wake of this weekend's George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin not guilty ruling, the legendary singer has announced he will boycott Florida until the state's Stand Your Ground laws are erased. &quot;I decided today that until the Stand Your Ground law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again,&quot; Wonder said during a concert Sunday in Quebec City, according to the Hollywood Reporter. &quot;As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot; Countless artists have voiced their support for Martin's family since Zimmerman was ruled not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter on Saturday, including Beyonce, Rihanna and Solange. But Wonder's announcement is the strongest statement yet from an entertainer. He hasn't performed in Tampa Bay in years, and now it looks like that won't change anytime soon. &quot;The truth is that - for those of you who've lost in the battle for justice, wherever that fits in any part of the world - we can't bring them back,&quot; he said during the Quebec City show.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">where we stand Racism might have been a factor in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death. But that doesn't mean the jury reached the wrong verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If George Zimmerman and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had both been of the same race, we likely would not know either of their names. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a white man in Florida had killed an unarmed teenager who was also white, it still would have been a tragic death. But it would not have captured the attention of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two, however, were not the same race. And Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a young black man in a hoodie, a description too often stereotyped as being &quot;suspicious,&quot; as George Zimmerman believed. That shouldn't have happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those facts alone do not mean the jury was wrong to find Zimmerman not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All kinds of people this week are proclaiming to know better than the jurors - based largely on watching copious amounts of CNN. They believe that Zimmerman wrongly stereotyped Martin and, therefore, he should be found guilty of some charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American justice system, however, is far more complicated than that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The burden our court system puts on prosecutors is great: It demands that defendants be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If a jury thinks a defendant might have done it, but might not have - that's a reasonable doubt. Even if a jury thinks the defendant probably did it, but they just aren't sure - that, too, is a reasonable doubt. In this case, the jury was instructed by the court that Zimmerman was allowed to use deadly force not only if he actually faced death or bodily harm but if he merely thought he did. In that case, the defendant should be found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the microscope of national media, the trial progressed and the state made its case. Little evidence was provided to challenge Zimmerman's story, and jurors had no choice but to acquit. That's the way our system works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's tragic that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is dead. It's unfortunate that George Zimmerman got out of his truck that fateful night (dispatchers told him not to). But he did get out. And Martin died at Zimmerman's hand. It's a sad story, and racism very likely plays a part. Racism might also play a role in why police and prosecutors were reluctant to charge Zimmerman in the first place - that will be up to the city of Sanford to determine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when it came to the trial, it wasn't racism that impacted the outcome. Our justice system is designed to protect the accused, and in this case, prosecutors just couldn't come up with enough evidence to prove Zimmerman guilty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramadan could be deadliest yet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD - Ramadan this year is shaping up to be the deadliest in Iraq since a bloody insurgency and rampant sectarian killings pushed the country to the edge of civil war in the wake of the U.S.-led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein. Suicide attacks, car bombings and other violence have killed at least 169 Iraqis just seven days into the Islamic holy month. The death toll in the first week of Ramadan hasn't been that high since 2007, intensifying fears that Iraq is slipping back into widespread chaos. There seems to be little pattern in the range of targets, adding to the sense of unease in what is meant to be a month of spiritual growth and generosity. Several of those killed over the past week died at a busy northern teashop while playing mehebis, a game where players hope to win sweets by guessing who among their opposing team is hiding a ring in their hands.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spacewalker survives scare</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - In one of the most harrowing spacewalks in years, an astronaut had to rush back into the International Space Station on Tuesday after a mysterious water leak inside his helmet robbed him of the ability to speak or hear and could have caused him to choke. Italian Luca Parmitano seemed fine after the dangerous episode, which might have been caused by a leaky drinking bag. His spacewalking partner, American Christopher Cassidy, had to help him inside after NASA quickly aborted the spacewalk. No one - neither the astronauts in orbit nor flight controllers in Houston - breathed easily until Parmitano was back inside and his helmet was yanked off. &quot;He looks miserable. But OK,&quot; Cassidy, assured everyone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman protests turn violent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES - Disturbances spiralling out of Los Angeles street protests against the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin will not be allowed to continue, city leaders vowed Tuesday after a spate of vandalism and assaults that led to 14 arrests. Demonstrations began occurring in California Saturday evening, when word of the Florida verdict arrived. Trouble has repeatedly occurred in Oakland and in Los Angeles, particularly in the Crenshaw district southwest of downtown. On Monday night, about 150 people split off from a demonstration at a Crenshaw-area park and ran through streets, jumping on cars, trying to break store windows and committing assaults. A Wal-Mart store was vandalized by intruders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accident</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boat capsizes, killing four asylum seekers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CANBERRA, Australia - A boat carrying 150 people believed to be asylum seekers capsized in the Indian Ocean on Tuesday, killing four people, Australian officials said. The boat turned over in rough seas north of Christmas Island, an Australian territory 500 kilometres (310 miles) south of Jakarta, Indonesia, Australia's Customs and Border Protection said in a statement. Two navy ships had earlier been sent to assist the vessel but were unable to board it due to bad weather. The ships were escorting it to Christmas Island, where Australia operates a detention camp for asylum seekers, when it flipped. Rescuers dropped life rafts into the water and plucked 144 survivors to safety. Four bodies were recovered and the search was called off Tuesday night, the border protection authority said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5,700 missing due to flood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUCKNOW, India - More than 5,700 people, missing since last month's devastating floods that ravaged northern India, are now presumed dead, a top official said Tuesday. Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna said Tuesday that the Uttarakhand state government would give financial compensation to the families of people who may have perished in the floods and landslides that hit the Himalayan region in June. The government had earlier put the death toll at 600 but repeatedly stressed that it would be significantly higher. Bahuguna said recovery operations would continue, adding the exact number of people who died may never be known.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON: Protests, vigils, and sporadic acts of violence erupted across America as black groups and civil libertarians demonstrated in scores of cities against the acquittal of a self-appointed white neighborhood watchdog on charges of killing a black youth, while a concerned President Barack Obama appealed for calm and respect for the legal process that resulted in the jury's not-guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's first mixed race President has so far been cautious in speaking about a case that has convulsed America for the racial divide it has brought to the fore, except for one time when he said that if he had a son, he would be like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the 17-year old Florida kid who was shot and killed by George Zimmerman on suspicion of ''being up to no good.'' While that suggested Obama was weighing in on the side of the slain victim, on Sunday the President was more circumspect in the face of black fury. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a tragedy. Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America. I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son,'' Obama said in a statement released by the White House even as crowds gathered in many public squares from New York City to Washington DC to Los Angeles, where there was face-to-face confrontation with riot police, including firing of rubber bullets at demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many demonstrators wore ''hoodies'' - hooded sweatshirts mostly worn by young blacks - to express solidarity with Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US President also called for self-examination from Americans in a country wracked by endemic gun violence that claims nearly 30,000 lives every years, including homicides and suicides. ''We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities. We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this. As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,'' Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But immediate focus of anger and attention in public demonstration was not so much the trigger-happiness of America but the racial divide that many activists say resulted in the Zimmerman's version of firing in self-defense after a violent confrontation with Martin being readily accepted. Police initially did not file charges against Zimmerman and he was arrested more than a month after the shooting only after nationwide protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's supporters say Zimmerman had been maliciously been profiling black men, but his defense was able to convince the jury that he was not a racist; not only is his mother Hispanic, but he had once taken a black girl to a high school prom and mentored black children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents, who are separated and did not come to the court when the verdict was pronounced, invoked God to deal with their grief. &quot;Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you. You are all that I have. At the end of the day, GOD is still in control. Thank you all for your prayers and support. I will love you forever Trayvon!!! In the name of Jesus!!!&quot; his mother tweeted soon after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side of the divide, Zimmerman's family expressed relief at the verdict while expressing apprehensions about the future safety of a man who has already begun to keep a low-profile fearing for his life. ''Today... I'm proud to be an American. God Bless America! Thank you for your prayers!&quot; his older brother Robert said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black activists and political leaders are pressing the Obama administration to prosecute Zimmerman under federal racial discrimination laws and also persuading his family to file a civil suit for financial damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An anonymous juror in the George Zimmerman trial is no longer writing a tell-all book after saying on CNN that an unarmed Trayvon Martin was partly to blame for his fate while his killer's &quot;heart was in the right place.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman, known as Juror B37, said she was unaware while sequestered of the widespread anger surrounding the racially charged case. Now, she said, &quot;I have realized that the best direction for me to go is away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the interview, she said in a statement that she'd changed her mind about writing the book with her husband, a lawyer, after signing a contract to do so earlier Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it emerged Tuesday that the juror's literary agent, Sharlene Martin, was the first to have a change of heart following hours of social media pressure. One Twitter user with the handle @MoreAndAgain got the ball rolling while watching the interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey @sharlenemartin, please drop Juror B37,&quot; one of the tweets read. &quot;Do not let a person who helped a murderer get away profit from this tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Change.org petition was also circulated, asking Martin to end her representation of the juror. By 1 a.m., she reportedly tweeted that she'd reconsidered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 has further angered Americans dismayed by the not-guilty verdict handed down to Zimmerman over the weekend. The case has reopened wounds in a country where racial tensions still simmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, a black 17-year-old, was walking to his father's house in Sanford, Fla., when he caught the eye of Zimmerman, an armed neighbourhood watch guard who began following him. Martin died after an altercation between the two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder. Jurors were also allowed to consider manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests against the verdict are showing no signs of abating. Civil rights leaders announced Tuesday that they're organizing vigils and rallies in 100 American cities this weekend to pressure the Department of Justice to lay federal charges against Zimmerman. The department says it's investigating whether civil rights charges can be laid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police and civic leaders braced for more unrest on Tuesday after nearly two dozen protesters were arrested in Los Angeles and Oakland. Los Angeles police said Monday night's disturbances involved about 150 people who broke off from an otherwise peaceful prayer vigil for Martin. Vandals set trash on fire, smashed windows and assaulted a television news crew during several hours of unrest on Monday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder assailed Stand Your Ground laws on Tuesday, suggesting they encourage violence and &quot;undermine public safety.&quot; Under the law, an aggressor can claim self-defence in the middle of an altercation - and use deadly force if deemed necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defence and sow dangerous conflict in our neighbourhoods,&quot; Holder said in a speech to the NAACP.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hundred people of all ages, races and genders converged on John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park for a vigil Tuesday night to work through their pain and frustration over the verdict in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin murder trial. The unarmed 17-year-old African-American was fatally shot by neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman in February 2012 as he was walking through a neighborhood where both Martin's father and Zimmerman lived in Sanford, Fla. A Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman of all charges on Saturday. Danny Williams Jr., a senior at Booker T. Washington High School and president of the school group Men of Power, was one of the last speakers at the Candlelight Vigil for Racial Healing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was 16 when Martin was killed. &quot;These events have made me feel things. I realize perception is reality,&quot; said Williams, who is black. &quot;Despite my higher-than-average grade point average and my dreams for the future, I'm still viewed as a possibly violent man. &quot;Zimmerman was never on trial; Trayvon was on trial,&quot; he said. &quot;His crime was being a black child at night, and his punishment was death.&quot; Felicia Collins Correia, chief executive officer of YWCA Tulsa, which hosted the vigil, said she and other mothers of black sons fear for them every day because they often are viewed as a threat. &quot;Each and every life has value, but in America we don't value the lives of black and brown men,&quot; Collins Correia said. Justice Waidner Smith, the YWCA's director of human resources, noted that one in three black men will spend time in prison. &quot;This must end,&quot; she said. &quot;Black and brown men are not expendable. Racism must be dismantled.&quot; Geoff Woodson, who attended the vigil after learning about it through social media, said holding a vigil such as this is exactly what the park was made for, but he said it's sad that it takes a tragedy for the community to come together. &quot;This is something we should do, anyway,&quot; Woodson said. &quot;We still have (Interstate) 244 that divides us. We still have people that don't want to talk about the 1921 (Tulsa) Race Riot. We need to come together. It's the only way healing can take place.&quot; Mana Tahaie, director of racial justice for the YWCA, also helped organize the vigil. &quot;Tulsa, we're not a stranger to violence, like a lot of places. We're not unique in having problems with race,&quot; Tahaie said, adding that &quot;it's tremendously healing to come together and have a collective experience.&quot; By the end of the evening, some of the frustration seemed to change to hope as the group crowded around the &quot;hope&quot; side of the park's 16-foot granite structure depicting scenes from the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot and sang &quot;This Land is Your Land&quot; while waving battery-powered candles in the air. Doc James, who led the crowd in song, said it made him happy to see so many faces of different colors. &quot;It's not about the race of the person; it's about the injustice,&quot; James said. &quot;It's not about the color or creed or gender of the person but about justice.&quot; Sara Plummer 918-581-8465 a class=&quot;ArticleLink&quot; href=&quot;mailto:sara.plummer@tulsaworld.com&quot;sara.plummer@tulsaworld.com</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are so programmed by our history with race in America that reaction to the acquittal of George Zimmerman on charges of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin depends largely upon one's individual, even group experience. If you are African-American, you might react like former Washington, D.C., homicide detective Rod Wheeler. Appearing on Fox News, Wheeler said many blacks look at quarterback Michael Vick, jailed for taking part in an illegal interstate dog-fighting ring, and wonder why Zimmerman gets away with killing a young black man. If you are white, or Hispanic, you could possibly see the trial as something whipped up by the always racially conscious media and rhetorical bomb-throwers like Rev.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Sharpton. You might conclude that if the victim had been white and the perpetrator black the media would have shown little or no interest. Or you could point to O.J. Simpson, who was acquitted of killing two white people by a majority African-American jury. Your view would be reinforced by a case in Georgia in which four African-American teenagers beat a 36-year-old white man as he emerged from a gas station convenience store. While trying to escape, the man stumbled into the middle lane of a highway where he was struck by a car and killed. The Marietta Daily Journal reported that the four are charged with felony murder, aggravated assault and violation of the Georgia Street Gang Act. The incident occurred two weeks ago, but I have seen no national media coverage. As defense lawyers noted after the Zimmerman verdict, the loss of any life, especially a young one like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, is a tragedy, but tragedy and race were not on trial in Sanford, Fla. Putting all extraneous considerations aside, the jury of six women was asked if there was sufficient evidence presented by the prosecution to convict George Zimmerman of murder or manslaughter. The jury found there was not. The Justice Department says it will look into the shooting death of Martin to determine if evidence in the case &quot;reveals a prosecutable violation.&quot; That may turn out to be more of a political decision than one based on facts. It would likely perpetuate the media narrative of blacks as victims and whites (one CNN reporter ludicrously called Zimmerman a &quot;white Hispanic&quot;) as descendants of slave masters. What helps keep us divided is our propensity for labeling and categorizing people. Certain behaviors and language are tolerated, while others are not. Some people can get away with language that others cannot. Some faiths can be disparaged while others are insulated from criticism. We hyphenate some Americans, making them appear as though they are less than fully American. What is needed is one standard. One national identity. One America. We're not there yet. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family, compared Trayvon's death to those of Emmett Till and Medgar Evers. Any attempt to turn Trayvon into a civil rights martyr similar to Till and Evers goes well beyond the apples and oranges analogy. More to the point was a comment by Zimmerman's attorney Don West: &quot;The prosecution of George Zimmerman was disgraceful.&quot; The defense believes he should never have been brought to trial. Co-defense counsel Mark O'Mara speculated about &quot;how many lawsuits will be spawned by this fiasco.&quot; Probably quite a few, given our never-ending racial double standard. As both sides noted during and after the trial, there are no winners in this case.</SPAN></P>

In a video posted on YouTube, the 63-year-old singer said at a concert in Quebec City, Canada, on Sunday &quot;that until the 'stand your ground' law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again.&quot; Wonder added: &quot;Wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot; The &quot;stand your ground&quot; law allows people to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger. The &quot;stand your ground&quot; law arguably was not a factor in Zimmerman's acquittal, but it was a much-discussed potential motivation for Zimmerman's actions on the night of Feb. 26, 2012, when he shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman said he fired his gun in self-defense. A six-member jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges on Saturday.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called Tuesday for a re-examination of &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws that expand the right to self-defense in the wake of George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods,&quot; Holder told a national convention of the NAACP. &quot;These laws try to fix something that was never broken. There has always been a legal defense for using deadly force if -- and the 'if' is important -- no safe retreat is available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida is one of more than two dozen states that have stand your ground laws. They allow people to defend themselves with lethal force without first attempting to retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder also repeated his pledge on Monday to conduct  a thorough investigation into the Feb. 26, 2012, shooting of the 17-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Sanford, Fla., jury found Zimmerman, 29, not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, claimed Trayvon had attacked him and he shot the teen in self-defense. State prosecutors said Zimmerman profiled and murdered Trayvon, then lied about the teen initiating the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal investigation into the death was opened last year and prosecutors from the Justice Department's civil rights division will review evidence from the FBI and the Florida criminal trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAACP leader Benjamin Jealous has urged the Justice Department to file civil rights charges against Zimmerman. To bring a civil rights case, the department must show evidence that Zimmerman killed the youth because he was African American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder said that after Trayvon's death, he talked to his teen son about how to interact with police and others as a black man. He said his own father had the same talk with him. &quot;I had to do this to protect my boy,&quot; Holder said. &quot;We must confront the underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs, and unfortunate stereotypes that serve too often as the basis for police action and private judgments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sharp contrast to that view, Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., said in a radio interview Tuesday: &quot;We're hung up on this one case, where this one fellow was, in fact, found not guilty by a jury. That's the way the American law system works. Get over it.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A juror who has been vocal since the acquittal of George Zimmerman said Tuesday night in a CNN interview that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin &quot;played a huge role&quot; in his own death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When George confronted him ... he could have walked away and gone home,&quot; the woman, identified only as juror B-37, said of the 17-year-old. &quot;He didn't have to do whatever he did and come back and be in a fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-woman jury on Saturday acquitted Zimmerman, 29, a neighborhood watch volunteer, of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the February 2012 shooting death of Trayvon in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror said earlier Tuesday that she dropped plans to write a book about the trial. Her interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper partly aired Monday and continued Tuesday. Her face was not visible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to notes from the jury selection process, juror B-37 is a white, middle-aged woman who works as a chiropractor. She is the daughter of an Air Force captain, has two adult children and has been married to an attorney for 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that she and other jurors felt a lot of sympathy for what happened to Trayvon and that she wished she could have given his family &quot;the verdict they wanted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want people to think that we didn't think about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; she said.  &quot;We did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that she and other jurors wanted to convict Zimmerman of something but that there was nothing legally they could do. &quot;I wanted to find him guilty of not using his senses,&quot; the juror said. &quot;You can't charge him with anything because he didn't do anything unlawful.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just about every aspect of why and how George Zimmerman came to fatally shoot an unarmed teenager on Feb. 26, 2012, is open for debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one conclusion ought to be obvious: If Zimmerman had not been carrying a gun that night, Trayvon Martin would be alive today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unarmed Zimmerman probably would have heeded police advice to stay in his truck after seeing someone he believed was &quot;up to no good.&quot; And even if the neighborhood watch volunteer had left the vehicle, his altercation with Martin is unlikely to have turned deadly if a firearm had not been involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viewed from that perspective, the Zimmerman case is a byproduct of a  society that in the past three decades has made it easier for people to buy guns, to carry concealed guns, to take guns into more places, and to bear less responsibility to retreat from dangerous situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1981, 19 states prohibited people from carrying a hidden weapon in public. And 28 states granted law enforcement the discretion to issue permits based on guidelines set by each state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a powerful gun lobby has turned that system upside down. Today in most states it's relatively easy to get a concealed carry permit. In 2011, Wyoming became the fourth state -- joining Alaska, Arizona and Vermont -- to allow concealed firearms, no permit needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 35 states, authorities must issue permits to just about any adult who seeks one, with limited exceptions such as a felony. In some states, if local police know that an applicant has made trouble in his neighborhood, has a drinking problem or has been arrested for a string of minor crimes, no matter. If the crime isn't on a prohibited list, authorities must issue that permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no question that people have a constitutional right to bear arms, but the gun lobby has pushed its &quot;guns everywhere&quot; agenda to absurd extremes. As of two years ago, a dozen states allowed hidden guns in bars, places of worship, state parks and on college campuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bars? Do we even need to debate that one? Nor do you need a Ph.D. to understand that letting college students pack heat on campus -- where binge drinking, drug taking and immature judgment are common -- is likely to cost more lives than the guns save.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Add to this volatile mix the rush by nearly half the states, led by Florida in 2005, to pass self-defense laws -- described as &quot;stand your ground&quot; by supporters and &quot;shoot first&quot; by critics -- and you've got another ingredient in the recipe for disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighborhood Watch, which Zimmerman coordinated for his community, is one of the few places where, no matter the state, participants are warned against carrying a weapon. The program, created by the National Sheriffs' Association, advises in its training manual that members &quot;shall not carry weapons&quot; and should never do more than observe and call police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's wise advice, which, if heeded, would have averted a needless tragedy one rainy night in Sanford, Fla. <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexandra Le Tellier, Los Angeles Times: &quot;In the wake of the George Zimmerman verdict, which acquitted him in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, activists took to the streets across the nation to stand up for civil rights. ... Activists are spreading an important message, but what will happen when the demonstrations stop? Will we forget about Martin? ... If we want to honor Martin, we have to use this moment as a catalyst for meaningful changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, editorial: &quot;Racial diversity of the crowds that marched Sunday indicate that one doesn't have to be black to be upset by the teenager's death. That said, black Americans are likely to be feeling emotions that go well beyond mere sadness or even anger. There (seems) to be an ineffable vulnerability and anxiety after the verdict. Zimmerman's acquittal has left many black parents wondering how to protect, how to console and how to instruct their children.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Klare, The Daily Reveille, Baton Rouge: &quot;Attacks (on the courts) emerge every time a verdict like this is reached, but the system never changes. Instead of demonstrating a problem within the courts, these protesters show just how unfamiliar they are with justice system and why it operates the way it does. Like it or not, the 'not guilty' verdict is exactly what our justice system should have chosen given the evidence. Zimmerman may have been guilty. Despite the lack of evidence, there is an upsetting possibility that our system just allowed a murderer to walk free. And to these protesters attacking the justice system, this is all that matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rupert Cornwell, The Independent, London: &quot;Every now and then, America generates the perfect media storm. The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was one such, featuring just about every hot-button law-and-order issue you could imagine: guns and neighborhood vigilantes, self-defense and the right to carry concealed weapons. And of course, permeating everything, race. ... Even so, this case will surely not have the same impact on race relations in the U.S. as the Rodney King case did, still less the 1968 murder of Martin Luther King, when entire cities went up in flames. Yes, there has been heated rhetoric, claims that the bad old days were never truly banished. But the protests ... after the verdict was handed down -- heartfelt yet almost entirely peaceful -- surely tell a more accurate story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Von Bader, New Times Broward-Palm Beach: &quot;(The) case has called everyone from the lowliest of Facebook pundits ... to ... cultural icons to roost upon a bandwidth-choking, virtual soapbox. Whether you believe that Saturday's verdict was wrong, right or a distraction ... you most likely have an opinion. ...  However, at the end of the day, you're not Stevie Wonder -- so you can't do things like refuse to perform in Florida until the 'stand your ground' law is 'abolished.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marc W. Polite, Time: &quot;The last major racial riot occurred in Los Angeles after four police officers were acquitted in the brutal beating of Rodney King. That was 21 years ago. Since then  ... the police officers who murdered Sean Bell in a hail of 50 bullets were acquitted in 2008, and no riots ensued. The indictment of the officer that shot and killed Bronx teenager Ramarley Graham was tossed outearlier this year. (Graham's) mother didn't call for riots. She made T-shirts to protest. In some ways, the calls for order recapitulate what this case is all about, the assumption of (black) violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevie Wonder is standing his ground in the wake of the death of Trayvon Martin. In a video posted on YouTube, the 63-year-old singer said at a concert in Quebec City  Sunday that he won't perform in Florida and other states with a &quot;stand your ground&quot; firearm self-defense law, which allows people to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger. George Zimmerman said he was defending himself when he shot the 17-year-old during a confrontation in Sanford, Fla., in February 2012. A jury acquitted Zimmerman late Saturday of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the never-ending cycle of pleas, protests and prayers over recurring injustice, we're again approaching the quiet times. Put down the signs. Take off the hoodies. Remove the empty bags of Skittles taped over your mouths. Go in for some &quot;calm reflection,&quot; as President Obama put it in a statement following Saturday night's miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where do we go from here - this time? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We stood in that doorway in Simi Valley, when an all-white jury found the cops who beat Rodney King half to death not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now a jury in Florida has found neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of murder in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Nothing new here. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The doorway to a great cause is often a terribly tragic case,&quot; said Benjamin Jealous, chairman of the NAACP. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors in Seminole County would have us believe that Trayvon caused himself to be shot by confronting Zimmerman, who appeared to be stalking the boy. A fistfight ensued, and because Zimmerman felt that he was too fat and out of shape to win fair and square, he was within his right to pull a gun and kill Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, the NAACP began circulation petitions demanding that the Justice Department file civil rights charges in the case. So far, the effort has garnered more than a million signatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hundreds of thousands of these people also signed up with the NAACP,&quot; Jealous said. &quot;In addition to pushing for federal charges to be filed, they'll also be pushing for anti-racial profiling legislation, for repeal of 'stand your ground' gun laws and reforms to the criminal justice system. And we still have our voter registration efforts underway nationally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jealous noted that &quot;the petitions were being signed at a rate of 100 a minute,&quot; reflecting intense dissatisfaction with the Florida verdict. And yet, at the very same time, Obama and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. have been signaling that making a federal case of the killing is not likely to happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an address to the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority in Washington following the verdict, Holder said he was trying to &quot;alleviate tensions&quot; and &quot;promote healing.&quot; Obama, in his statement, acknowledged that the case had stirred &quot;strong passions,&quot; then went on to say, &quot;But we are a nation of laws, and the jury has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what happens to all that spirit of activism if the petition drive fails? Does the door to the great cause slam shut yet again? Probably - except that this time a confluence of events will likely keep it ajar awhile longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court decision to strike down a critical section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict amount to a tag team gut punch to black America - from the high court and the low. In the same month that the nation's oldest black service sorority gathered in the nation's capital to mark its 100th anniversary, and a month before a gathering on the Mall to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington, it feels like a legalized spit in the face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A little less than 3 percent of black-on-white homicides taking place in circumstances similar to the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case are ruled to be justified, according to a study by John Roman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. But when the races are reversed and whites kill blacks, the percentage of cases that are ruled to be justified climbs to more than 29 percent in non-stand-your-ground states - and almost 36 percent in stand-your-ground states such as Florida, where the law allows people to defend themselves with deadly force, if necessary, if they believe someone is trying to kill or harm them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the NAACP kicks off its annual convention in Orlando - less than 30 miles from the courthouse where the Martin murder case was tried. Jealous will certainly note these assaults on civil rights as he attempts to rally the troops. But there will also be victories to cite. In the months since Trayvon's killing first made headlines, law enforcement agencies throughout the country began exploring ways to improve relationships with black youths, particularly males. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More states have passed anti-racial profiling legislation and, for the first time in five years, no state passed a stand-your-ground gun law last year (except for Alaska), Jealous said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Already the movement that has been built as a result of Trayvon's death is showing signs of staying power,&quot; Jealous said. &quot;Another generation has been activated, just as a generation was activated by the beating of Rodney King and another generation before that by the lynching of Emmett Till.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So where do we go from here - this time? Jealous answers onward and upward, toward a more sophisticated political strategy for enacting progressive legislation. But I'm not sure it's quite time for &quot;calm reflection.&quot; America, and Obama, need to hear, loudly and clearly, that African Americans are angry and alarmed and will not accept any diminution of the freedoms and protections we've fought so hard to achieve. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Florida verdict stirs up nation&quot; [front page, July 15]:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is something rotten in the state of Florida if an armed volunteer, having pursued and killed an unarmed boy , is then judged to have no criminal responsibility in the death of a minor. The boy was minding his own business; the man made it his business to confront him despite a prior suggestion from the police not to pursue him. If permissive laws protect this act, when and where are we safe? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Farmer, Gordonsville, Va.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the victims of Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., Trayvon Martin is a  victim of gun violence and over-permissive gun laws. Because of Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, and the burden of proof required to get around a claim of self-defense, the jury in this case had little choice but to find George Zimmerman not guilty. Not guilty, but not innocent either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real villains in the Martin case are the 40-odd Republicans and four Democratic senators in Washington who refused to pass stricter gun-control laws and the Florida legislature, which passed &quot;stand your ground&quot; and other laws that make it easy to carry a lethal weapon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is still, in the second decade of the 21st century, an angry, racially divided and violent nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry A. Lowenstein, New York</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman has been acquitted, but he actually will never be a free man. This case will haunt him and follow him and his family forever. You could say that the real killer is the state of Florida. Combine &quot;stand your ground,&quot; neighborhood watch and novices having handguns, and you have a crime waiting to happen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This verdict will linger forever in the minds of people looking for justice; this case is not over yet.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's history with the politics of race - his own, and the way it is lived in this country - has been both beneficial and vexing over the course of his public life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial identity was at the heart of his best-selling memoir, commissioned after he was elected the first African American president of the Harvard Law Review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It helped distinguish him from more experienced Democrats in the 2008 presidential primaries, then nearly doomed his candidacy after his close relationship with a provocative black pastor was revealed. Once in the White House, his race often appeared to be as much a burden for him as an asset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now as he confronts public anger about the acquittal of George Zimmerman for fatally shooting an unarmed black teenager, Obama is being challenged again to meet the unique demands that come with being the nation's first African American president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's handling of the verdict's aftermath reflects some of the hard-learned lessons of the past four years. Rather than criticism, he has chosen a tone of consolation, avoiding the issue of race directly to help cool the country down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday afternoon, Obama issued a short statement asking &quot;every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son,&quot; a 17-year-old named Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our communities,&quot; he continued, citing gun violence rather than racial mistrust as a specific issue to be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama chose to issue the written statement rather than address the nation on camera - an option White House officials say was never discussed. It is highly unusual for a president to comment on a specific court case, and even more rare to do so on camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But senior administration officials said the fact that he had done so previously in the Martin case - and that the verdict had prompted strong emotions - influenced the decision to say something in writing. Obama helped draft the statement, they said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It wasn't assumed inside the White House that he would obviously do this,&quot; said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the decision. &quot;But this was something he had spoken to personally, in a very personal way, last year. And it's a story that the country was really following.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of all the &quot;firsts&quot; Obama has achieved, his role as the country's first black president has never been one in which he has been entirely comfortable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His political near-death experience in the 2008 Democratic primaries caused by his relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, a Chicago pastor whose angry sermons were tinged with racial grievance, haunted Obama as he entered office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His message from the start was that he would be a president for all Americans, not just black Americans. He was unsentimental about his achievement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the inauguration, I think there was justifiable pride on the part of the country that we had taken a step that had moved us beyond some of the searing legacies of racial discrimination in this country,&quot; Obama said during a news conference a little more than two months after his swearing-in. &quot;And that lasted about a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four months later, Obama for the first time joined the on-again, off-again national conversation about race as president, brusquely and to politically damaging effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked during a news conference about the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. at his home in Cambridge, Mass., Obama said the police had &quot;acted stupidly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star professor of the university's African American studies program faced charges of disorderly conduct - later dropped - in a case that appeared to highlight the use of racial profiling in police work. Obama had worked on the issue as a state legislator in Illinois and as a U.S. senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the new president's standing among white voters declined almost immediately  and, to some extent, has never recovered. He later called his comments &quot;stupid&quot; and invited Gates and Cambridge police Sgt. James Crowley, who arrested the professor, to the White House for a beer to talk about the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president wants to continue to take the temperature down,&quot; Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary at the time, said on the eve of what came to be called the beer summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has written extensively about navigating white and black America from Chicago's South Side to Harvard Law and beyond. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As president, he has sought to do the same, appealing to both white supporters and African Americans, whose expectations for his administration are perhaps the highest. He has argued that his policies are colorblind, from his various proposals to create jobs or those he has promoted unsuccessfully to better regulate gun purchases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His black supporters have often asked for more attention given a higher unemployment rate and other problems among African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has not always taken those complaints well. During a speech to the Congressional Black Caucus in September 2011, he unexpectedly admonished the audience, saying that &quot;I expect all of you to march with me and press on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Take off your bedroom slippers, put on your marching shoes,&quot; he said. &quot;Shake it off. Stop complaining, stop grumbling, stop crying. We are going to press on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next time he explicitly addressed race was in the days following the March 2012 shooting of Martin by Zimmerman, then a 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., who argued that he had acted in self-defense. A jury in the case agreed last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in the Gates arrest, reporters asked Obama last year about the Martin shooting. Only this time, in the midst of an election season, he was prepared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; he said. &quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama did not mention race specifically in his comments that day in the Rose Garden, but the message from a black father was clear to those who wanted to hear it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also reserved judgment about the case itself, just as he did Sunday night about the verdict. A fuller response has been left largely to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who has often served as the president's proxy on race matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's response to the Zimmerman verdict has satisfied some, but many African Americans would like to hear more from the first African American president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of now, White House officials say, that is unlikely to happen as the Justice Department considers a federal civil rights case against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not going to get out ahead of that,&quot; White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday. &quot;Right now, the president views this as a tragedy, the loss of a young person - for his family, for the community and for the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO - Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. strongly condemned &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws Tuesday, saying the measures &quot;senselessly expand the concept of self-defense&quot; and may encourage &quot;violent situations to escalate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statutes, which have been enacted in more than 30 states, have become the focus of a complicated national debate over race, crime and culpability since the shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old, by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla. The volunteer, George Zimmerman, was acquitted of murder charges Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's attorneys did not try to get the case dismissed based on Florida's stand-your-ground law, which says people who feel threatened can defend themselves with deadly force and are not legally required to flee. Still, the jury was instructed that as long as Zimmerman was not involved in an illegal activity and had a right to be where he was when the shooting occurred, &quot;he had no duty to retreat and the right to stand his ground.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These laws try to fix something that was never broken,&quot; Holder told cheering delegates of the annual convention of the NAACP, which is pressing him to file civil rights charges against Zimmerman. &quot;The list of resulting tragedies is long and, unfortunately, has victimized too many who are innocent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorney general, who is the first African American ever to hold that position, drew parallels between his own life and the claims of many here that Zimmerman racially profiled Martin after spotting the teenager walking through his father's neighborhood in a hooded sweatshirt.  Martin was African American. Zimmerman's father is white, his mother Peruvian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder recalled being pulled over twice by police on the New Jersey Turnpike as a young man and having his car searched, &quot;when I'm sure I wasn't speeding.&quot; Another time, he said, he was stopped by law enforcement in Georgetown while simply running to catch a movie after dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was, at the time of that last incident, a federal prosecutor,&quot; Holder said dryly, prompting some in the audience at the Orlando Convention Center to gasp in disgust and others to shake their heads. &quot;We must confront the underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs and unfortunate stereotypes that serve too often as the basis for police action and private judgments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder's comments were the most extensive discussion of the Zimmerman verdict by a member of the Obama administration so far. His personal stories and his denunciation of &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws brought the audience to its feet. But administration officials say that there is little the Justice Department can do to actually change the laws, because they are state, rather than federal, statutes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he was a youth growing up in New York, Holder said, his father - an immigrant from Barbados - warned him to act carefully if he was stopped by police. Decades later, after Martin was killed, the nation's chief law enforcement officer decided he had to have a similar conversation with his own 15-year-old son. &quot;This was a father-son tradition I hoped would not need to be handed down,&quot; he told the delegates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to address civil rights more broadly, Holder also invoked his late sister-in-law, Vivian Malone, one of two students who, with the protection of the National Guard, walked past Gov. George Wallace in 1963 to integrate the University of Alabama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her story, and others like it, drove me to dream of a career in public service and led me to spend my first summer in law school working for the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund,&quot; Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then sharply criticized last month's Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a critical component of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. The court said Congress must come up with a new formula based on current data to determine which states should be subject to preapproval by the Justice Department or a federal judge when changing voting laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department will not wait for Congress to take action, Holder said. Instead, the agency will shift resources in the department's civil rights division to focus on provisions of the act that were not affected by the Supreme Court's ruling, including Section 2, which prohibits voting discrimination based on race, color or language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the convention center lobby, though, the conversation on Tuesday was mostly about a slain teenager and the events leading up to and following his death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Bledsoe, vice chairman of the NAACP's legal committee, said that he heard enough during Zimmerman's three-week trial to convince him that race played a role. Martin was unarmed but, according to defense attorneys, initiated a physical fight after Zimmerman began tailing him. Prosecutors said Zimmerman profiled Martin and began the confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Especially compelling, to Bledsoe, was a statement Zimmerman made in a call to a non-emergency police line after first spotting Martin: &quot;These a--holes, they always get away.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are so many references with clear racial undertones,&quot; said Bledsoe, a Texas civil rights lawyer. &quot;You can break down the language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegates believe that it will be hard for Holder to ignore an NAACP petition, signed by more than 1 million people, asking for civil rights charges against Zimmerman. &quot;That's leverage,&quot; Bledsoe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And indeed, in his speech, Holder assured the delegates that the Justice Department is investigating Zimmerman for possible civil rights charges. But current and former Justice Department lawyers, speaking on the condition of anonymity, have said that bringing civil rights charges against Zimmerman would be extremely difficult, and may not be possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal has sparked demonstrations in major cities across the country, including protests in Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif., that have had moments of violence. At least nine people were arrested and one man was injured in Oakland on Monday night, and marchers in Los Angeles tore down railings and blocked a freeway. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Music superstar Stevie Wonder, who is African American, said at a concert Sunday in Canada that &quot;until the stand-your-ground law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again. As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the mood in Sanford, where the trial took place, has been remarkably calm, with small rallies and prayer services rather than fiery protests. And the convention atmosphere was even calmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence at protests hurts the effort to persuade the federal government to get involved, said Lloyd Thompson, an NAACP district official from northern Louisiana. Thompson said he wants demonstrations conducted in a &quot;quiet, soft manner.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida woman was cloaked in shadow, yet her appearance on CNN made her the public face of the jury that acquitted George Zimmerman of murder and manslaughter barely 48 hours earlier. She was at times inarticulate and self-contradictory during prime-time interviews Monday and Tuesday, but she is the sole real window into the two days of private deliberation that produced a very public verdict, whose announcement was viewed live on television Saturday night and triggered large demonstrations across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37, a middle-aged white resident of Seminole County and the mother of two adult children, appeared on TV as a silhouette, hungry enough for publicity to sit across from Anderson Cooper but cautious enough to demand the anonymity afforded by CNN and the court - pending a yet-to-be-scheduled hearing on the release of jurors' identities to the public. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public has tried to glean meaning from what she told Cooper - that Zimmerman's &quot;heart was in the right place,&quot; that things &quot;just went terribly wrong&quot; - and everyone from  pundits to Twitter trolls have condemned her statements as misbegotten or racist. (Four other jurors emphasized Tuesday that B37 did not reflect their views.) And in the visceral reaction to one juror speaking out, it's possible to feel the tension in the American system of trial by jury: People want juries to do so much more than they are empowered or supposed to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That desire might be rooted in the colonial role of juries as a bulwark against British rule, says Douglas Green, who lectures on jury selection and serves as president of the American Society of Trial Consultants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The right to a jury trial was fundamental to the colonies because they wanted to resist the authority of the crown,&quot; Green says. &quot;The reason people object when they hear these verdicts is because of this colonial perception of a jury as standing up for what is 'the right thing to do,' &quot; not for what is the correct, case-specific application of a certain law to a certain body of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman jury was initially split, Juror B37 told Cooper, with three voting &quot;not guilty,&quot; two advocating manslaughter and one ready to convict Zimmerman on the second-degree murder charge in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. All but one juror thought that the cries for help on a 911 call were Zimmerman's, she said. After 16-plus hours of deliberation, when all six women attested to their unanimous verdict, &quot;that's when everybody started to cry,&quot; B37 said, her voice quavering with emotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(In their statement late Tuesday, the four jurors said that Martin's death weighed on them emotionally and that the trial took its toll physically. But, the Associated Press reported, the jurors said &quot;they did what the law required them to do.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the television interviews, B37 sounded reticent and fatigued, as she did a month earlier when answering questions during a special round of pre-publicity jury selection, in which lawyers assessed potential jurors' exposure to media coverage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have no time to do anything other than feed my animals,&quot; she told state prosecutor Bernardo de la Rionda on June 11, adding that she occasionally watches the &quot;Today&quot; show and uses newspapers only to line her parrot's cage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either in spite or because of her apparent ignorance of the circumstances surrounding Martin's death, B37 was empaneled on the six-person jury (only capital-offense trials require 12 jurors in Florida) and spent three weeks sequestered from the outside world as she heard arguments and testimony at the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tall and slender, with long brown hair, Juror B37 watched the trial from the front row of the jury box, just steps from Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin. B37 usually stared straight ahead, taking in the motions of the trial but little of the surrounding spectacle. She was serious, focused, intense. While lawyers made their closing arguments, other jurors took notes furiously, but B37 seldom jotted down a word. Some in the courtroom speculated that she'd already made up her mind by that point. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her willingness to speak on national television, even after expressing a stand-offishness before opening arguments, isn't a surprise to Green.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These jurors have been through a lot, emotionally and physically - long, hard days listening to a lot of evidence - and they haven't been able to talk about it to friends or family or even their fellow jurors,&quot; Green says. &quot;At the end of this process, the ability to talk to somebody is therapeutic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B37 seemed both certain and confused during her CNN interview Monday, at one point saying that the jury &quot;knew exactly what happened,&quot; yet adding 30 seconds later that &quot;I don't think anybody knows&quot; what really happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper asked her why she was speaking out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want people to know that we put everything into everything to get this verdict,&quot; she said, her voice breaking again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thought about it for hours and cried over it afterwards,&quot; she continued. &quot;I don't think any of us could ever do anything like that ever again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday morning, B37 was represented by Seattle-based literary agent Sharlene Martin, who was ready to shop around a book about &quot;the commitment it takes to serve and be sequestered on a jury in a highly publicized murder trial.&quot; Mere hours after the interview aired, Martin tweeted that she was rescinding her offer of representation. Martin told the Los Angeles Times that she and B37 agreed to abort the project after the CNN interview but before a Twitter-fueled online petition was activated to squelch the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being sequestered &quot;shielded me from the depth of pain that exists among the general public,&quot; Juror B37 said in a statement released through Martin on Twitter around 1 a.m. Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the second part of her interview, which aired Tuesday night, Cooper asked B37 whether she thought Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had played a part in his own death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I believe he played a huge role in his death,&quot; she said, adding that &quot;when George confronted him, he could have walked away and gone home. He didn't have to do whatever he did and come back and be in a fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That mentality suggests that the jury accepted, at face value, Zimmerman's pretrial statements about Martin throwing the first punch, says Orlando criminal defense lawyer Aramis Donell Ayala, who notes that juries are instructed to apply Florida's self-defense statute &quot;at the time the force was used&quot; - not, say, at the time one person initiates an encounter by following another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therein lies the larger question of how clearly the jury-selection process reveals racial biases, Ayala says, and where aggression starts in the timeline of a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sad part is that no one sees the profiling - or the following of a person whom you've profiled - as a big enough social issue to make it illegal,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37, for her part, told Cooper that &quot;race did not play a role&quot; in the deliberation room. In the statement released within hours of her Monday interview, she expressed a desire to fade back into obscurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that I am returned to my family and to society in general,&quot; she said, &quot;I have realized that the best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book and return instead to my life as it was before I was called to sit on this jury.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is easy to understand how everyone in the Trayvon Martin -George Zimmerman case feels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I were Martin's mother, I'd want his killer's heart on a platter. If I were Zimmerman's mother, I'd be grateful my son escaped greater injury, however he managed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I were African American, I would fear for my sons and be furious at a system that condones vigilantism and then acts as though calling a teen's death a &quot;tragedy&quot; ends the discussion.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list could go on. The point is that this is one of those rare instances in which everyone is right within his or her own experience. African Americans are right to perceive that Martin was followed because he was black, but it is wrong to presume that recognizing a racial characteristic is necessarily racist. It has been established that several burglaries in Zimmerman's neighborhood primarily involved young black males. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Picture Zimmerman's neighbor Olivia Bertalan, a defense witness, hiding in her locked bedroom with her infant and a pair of rusty scissors while two young males, later identified as African American, burglarized her home. They ran when police arrived. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to justify what subsequently transpired between Zimmerman and Martin but to cast a dispassionate eye on reality. And no, just because a few black youths caused trouble doesn't mean all black youths should be viewed suspiciously. This is so obvious a truth that it shouldn't need saying and yet, if we are honest, we know that human nature includes the accumulation of evolved biases based on experience and survival. In the courtroom, it's called profiling. In the real world, it's called common sense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing we can all agree upon without much strain is that this incident - this senseless, heartbreaking death - never should have happened. Zimmerman, who began acting as a watchman in 2004 and had made more than 40 calls to authorities over the years, never should have left his car once he notified police, who told him to stay put. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also can surmise that Zimmerman would not have followed Martin if Zimmerman weren't carrying a gun. If Martin were perceived as dangerous, wouldn't an unarmed individual keep his distance until police arrived? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, we conclude that Zimmerman's actions led to the confrontation that ultimately resulted in a fight that ended with the fatal shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It never should have happened. And it didn't have to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury obviously felt that Zimmerman acted in self-defense, or, at least, that the state failed to prove otherwise. It must have been a terrible conclusion to reach because, no matter the legal definitions that guided them, it seems impossible that someone's young son, guilty of nothing, should die while his killer walks. Adages become such for a reason: The law is an ass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the definitions, instructions and evidence - in other words, by the book - the jurors ruled as they could and justice feels ill-served. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, yes, we understand how everyone feels. But feelings are like weather - they come and go and shift with time. Part of maturity - and fundamental to civilization - is learning to process feelings through thought, reflection and, in this case, debate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, in the wake of the Zimmerman verdict, feelings have been magnified and exploited by enablers - from certain members of the media, who seem more like rapacious rabble-rousers than journalists, to professional activists who, in fact, thrive on disorder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a good time to recognize that activists with television shows are not, in fact, journalists. When Al Sharpton went to Florida to organize demands that Zimmerman be charged, he was acting as the civil rights activist he is, not as the broadcast journalist he plays on television. Now, as he proceeds to organize protests in 100 cities, he has a global bullhorn with which to sound his fury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With such instigation, grass roots quickly erupt into wildfires. News organizations can't ignore news, obviously, but which came first: The death threats? Or the TV correspondent speculating whether Zimmerman would need to fear for his life?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As soon as passions cool, assuming we let them, the discussion that needs to take place surrounds a question: What was George Zimmerman doing walking around his neighborhood armed and loaded? In what world is this normal behavior? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer: Not a world most of us want to live in. Let's start there.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An anonymous juror in the George Zimmerman trial has backtracked on plans for a tell-all book after telling CNN that an unarmed Trayvon Martin was partly to blame for his fate while his killer's &quot;heart was in the right place.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman, known as Juror B37, said she was unaware while sequestered of the widespread anger surrounding the racially charged case, saying later she now &quot;realized that the best direction for me to go is away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror said she changed her mind about writing a book with her husband, a lawyer, after signing a contract to do so earlier Monday. But B37's interview with Anderson Cooper has only served to further anger Americans outraged by the not-guilty verdict handed down to Zimmerman over the weekend. The case has reopened wounds in a country where racial tensions still linger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into,&quot; the juror told Cooper of the incident, which left Martin gunned down just blocks from his father's home in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. &quot;I think they both could have walked away.&quot;Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder in the shooting, but the jury was also allowed to consider manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests against the verdict are showing no signs of abating this week as civil rights leaders announced Tuesday that they're organizing vigils and rallies in 100 cities this weekend to pressure the Department of Justice to lay federal charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department says it's investigating the shooting to determine whether criminal civil rights charges can now be laid against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, a 17-year-old black teen, was walking to his father's house from a convenience store when he caught the eye of Zimmerman, an armed neighbourhood watch guard who began following him. Martin died after an altercation between the two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African-Americans, in particular, have pointed to Martin's slaying as painful proof that young black men are viewed with suspicion and distrust by authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, said that watching so many Americans come together to peacefully protest the verdict have reminded her that there's still work to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fulton and her ex-husband, Tracy Martin, are pushing for restrictions to so-called Stand Your Ground laws in Florida and other states. Under the law, an aggressor can claim self-defence in the middle of an altercation - and use deadly force.</SPAN></P>

It attracted a modest 300,000 viewers in its Canadian premiere on the cable channel Space. It finished just ahead of a Murder, She Wrote (205,000) rerun on Vision TV and Johnny Test on Teletoon (177,000). In Sharknado, a Syfy original movie starring Beverly Hills 90210 alumnus Ian Ziering and Tara Reid, Los Angeles is being attacked by thousands of flying sharks during a tornado.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be vigils and rallies in a hundred US cities this weekend to press for federal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman over the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, the Rev Al Sharpton said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prominent civil rights activist announced the plan at a news conference with several church ministers outside the Justice Department in Washington. He did not say which cities would be involved, but did say the rallies and vigils will be staged on Saturday at federal buildings. Zimmerman's acquittal over the weekend touched off protests around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial of George Zimmerman has proved one of the most divisive in recent history in America and has triggered a fierce debate that has shaken the nation and threatens to redefine American cultural identity. What began as an issue of gun control and self-defence law soon morphed into one of race and class division as the country wrestles with issues on racial profiling and civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High profile celebrities are among those to speak out publicly about the verdict and the issues surrounding it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevie Wonder is the latest to fuel the debate, saying he will not perform in Florida and other states with a &quot;stand your ground&quot; firearm self-defence law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a video posted on You-Tube, the 63-year-old singer said at a concert in Quebec City, Canada, on Sunday &quot;that until the 'stand your ground' law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wonder added: &quot;Wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;stand your ground&quot; law allows people to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger. George Zimmerman said he fired in self-defence during his trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, CNN reported last night that three of the six jurors in the George Zimmerman trial believed that he was guilty of murder or manslaughter when they retired to consider their verdict, one of the all-female panel admitted during a broadcast interview with the TV channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her comments will stoke further controversy after she described how jurors found the laws very confusing and struggled to follow the judge''s instructions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As progressive activists reeled over the anti-abortion laws rushed through the Republican-controlled Wisconsin legislature last month, the word went out in Madison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 40 area activists answered the call sent out over social media and email. They gathered at the Capitol as dusk fell on June 15 to take part in a signature Wisconsin protest that is attracting attention around the world and has inspired imitators across the country. Holding up boards glowing with LED letters, protesters spelled out a slogan they say summed up legislators' antagonism toward women, epitomized in a bill requiring an ultrasound for anyone seeking an abortion: &quot;THE VAGINA DEMAGOGUES&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Progressive activism like this is increasingly is being spelled out in illuminated messages in cities across the country. What started as a loose collective of activists in Milwaukee as part of the campaign to recall Governor Walker has morphed into the Overpass Light Brigade, which has grown rapidly and now has 26 chapters in North America. OLB demonstrations ? where protesters stand quietly in still formation, spelling out a compelling slogan ? offer an entry to activism for those without the stomach for more aggressive actions like the storming of the Wisconsin Senate chambers by abortion rights protesters last month, organizers say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent provocative message on the Capitol lawn got a lot of reaction, said Carrie Riddle, who organizes OLB actions in Madison. She noted that it led to a conversation with a Capitol Police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He didn't know what the word ?demagogue' meant,&quot; she said. One passerby yelled at the protesters, and a group of college boys driving past started cheering. But most people were inquisitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People came up and asked what was going on. We talked about it,&quot; Riddle said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And every now and then, she recalled, a car passing by would honk out what had become an iconic sound of progressive political action in Wisconsin: &quot;This-is-what-democracylooks- like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like most OLB slogans, &quot;THE VAGINA DEMAGOGUES,&quot; came out of a brainstorming session among OLB married co-founders Lane Hall and Lisa Moline, both artists who teach at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and fellow organizer Joe Brusky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously we were thinking of ?The Vagina Monologues,'&quot; said Hall, adding that the group refrained from using the word &quot;vagina&quot; in other reproductive rights demonstrations that were displayed on overpasses. &quot;Since so much of the legislation against women's rights is about a woman's control over her body, the word seemed very appropriate ? it's obviously been politicized,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OLB slogans are spelled out in 3-foot by 2-foot black letter boards with LED letters. Hall built most of them, and details the process in a video on the group's website. Its collection of 65 letters includes the alphabet, duplicates of common letters, and punctuation marks like &amp;, #, =, and +, Hall said. Some letters do double duty ? an &quot;R,&quot; for example, can also be a &quot;P&quot; depending on which lights are switched on. That flexibility helps, but slogans are influenced by the availability of letters, as well as volunteers to hold them through what are typically 90-minute actions, Hall said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group uses social media to publicize its actions and those of its affiliates in cities from California to Massachusetts. Locally, they tap ranks of loosely connected activists of nearly 300 in the Milwaukee area and about 100 in Madison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The all-volunteer group works to respond quickly to current events unfolding on the state and national stage. In Milwaukee, it displayed &quot;TRAYVON LIVES ON&quot; in honor of the unarmed black teenager shot by George Zimmerman, who was acquitted this week. In June, the same group held up a message declaring &quot;DOMA = DOA,&quot; when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. Photographs of OLB's &quot;WISCONSIN WEEPS&quot; message at a vigil last August for victims of the fatal shooting at a Sikh Temple in Oak Creek went viral, attracting some 1.3 million clicks worldwide, Hall said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of the chapters, in the Fox Valley, 15 states and Ontario, Canada operates independently. Yet Hall believes OLB's influence will grow through joint campaigns with synchronized progressive messages. For instance, the group joined larger national &quot;STOP MONSANTO&quot; protests, part of worldwide demonstrations in May, to bring attention to the dangers of genetically modified food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hall and Moline first came up with the idea of an illuminated protest sign as they prepared for a late afternoon rally kicking off the Walker recall campaign in November 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thought about taking advantage of the darkness, and making a sign that could be a beacon for like minded-people in a difficult and divided time in this state,&quot; Moline said. &quot;We did some hunting and found off the shelf in a hardware store some LED Christmas lights that were battery operated ? they were great!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first illuminated protest sign was a single 3-foot by 4-foot board that read &quot;Recall Walker,&quot; said Hall. It was a magnet for attention from its first time out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was such a great visual, people wanted to be part of it,&quot; Moline said. &quot;As we marched, we handed it off to strangers ? it passed along person to person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sign was photographed many times and images made their way to MSNBC television host Rachel Maddow, and the innovative lighted protest sign got national media attention. The sign is now in the Wisconsin Historical Museum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To scale up the impact of their protest signs, the couple began building the boards with single illuminated letters that could be held up to spell out messages, starting with &quot;RECALL.&quot; To make their protests more visible, they moved their actions to pedestrian overpasses that span many thoroughfares in Milwaukee, and adopted the name Overpass Light Brigade. The word (and photos) of OLB spread through social media and soon the fledgling group was invited to other cities like Racine, Kenosha and Madison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've created a tactical tool that's out there and people ? from either side of the political spectrum ? can adopt it,&quot; said Hall, adding that it is progressive groups who are using it now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason for the group's success has been that OLB's low-key but powerful protests are an opportunity for people to dip a toe into the pool of political activism with little risk of being overwhelmed, Moline said. The actions, often called &quot;bridgeparties,&quot; are a good place for community building, she said. &quot;Since you can't distract drivers while holding the sign, you're standing still and can have a conversation among people who came together over something that has meaning for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actions draw a diverse group, said Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On any night, we might have public school teachers next to professors, next to city workers and ironworkers, labor activists and African-American activists. We have a strong Latino component, too,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Melissa Sargent, D-Madison, learned of the group on Facebook, and joined in a couple of OLB overpass actions before she was elected to the Wisconsin Assembly in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've always been a big supporter of the arts, and this seemed like a creative means of expression,&quot; she said. The nature of the action is symbolic of what it is all about, too, she said. &quot;One letter by itself doesn't mean anything, but if you bring them together it sends a strong message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lane credits Brusky, who like many OLB activists comes out of the Occupy movement, with ramping up the group's social media use to spread its message beyond Wisconsin; the unsuccessful recall election in June 2012 meant the group would need to broaden its focus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the group live tweets some protests. The profile picture on its Facebook account recently featured a wavy, reflected &quot;WE ARE WATER&quot; slogan in protest of legislative action jeopardizing the state's waterways. Shots of the group's &quot;IRON MINE = GENOCIDE&quot; action at the Capitol this spring protesting a mine that Lake Superior Ojibwe say threatens their way of life are featured on the OLB Vimeo channel. The overview video also includes a time-lapse sequence of a protest start to finish, as well as clips of affiliate groups (called the Light Brigade Network) across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's public profile has moved from the small stage of the protest sites ? which Hall calls the &quot;people's bandwidth&quot; ? through social media, to traditional media as varied as Fox News and the New Yorker magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group is also the subject of a short documentary, &quot;OLB,&quot; which had three screenings in Madison and Milwaukee this spring. And Hall and Moline are spreading the word about how to start up an OLB chapter, participating in a national Allied Media Conference in Detroit in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OLB has retained its practice of still and silent protests, even when not on an overpass where a commotion might distract drivers, Hall said. A commitment to a non-confrontational protocol in interacting with police has meant they seldom halt protests nowadays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our sense of civility I think has served us well,&quot; Hall said. &quot;We're out there because of an issue; we don't want to make the police the issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The model of non-confrontation seems to have served at least one chapter well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first half-dozen actions of the Overpass Light Brigade ? Austin were shut down quickly by police, co-founder Joe Cooper said. But quiet persistence paid off, and group's recent protests have not been obstructed by police, he said. &quot;This is a really easy way for someone to get involved in political action without risk of arrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in Wisconsin, recent actions by the Austin OLB chapter have focused on women's reproductive rights, including a &quot;GO WENDY GO&quot; demonstration in support of Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis' 11-hour filibuster that stalled a recent antiabortion bill. The illuminated letters are an unexpected sight that seems to disarm observers, even when they convey controversial messages, Cooper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It kind of opens people's minds, even if it's not something they agree with or would get active on. It's an uplifting approach,&quot; he said. Despite any tolerance OLB's approach may foster, in Texas as in Wisconsin, the battle over reproductive rights is not over. Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry ultimately signed the abortion restrictions Davis delayed in a special session. And Wisconsin legislators are drafting a provision, included in Texas law, that would bar abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Overpass Light Brigade may want to break out &quot;THE VAGINA DEMAGOGUES&quot; again.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD: US President Barack Obama has appealed to Americans for restraint amid anger from civil rights activists and public protests against the acquittal of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury comprising six women - reportedly five white and a hispanic - on Sunday found neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, after a long and racially-charged trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second-degree murder, having pursued Martin, 17, through a gated community in the town of Sanford, eventually shooting him during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial aroused strong passions and divided those who believed that Zimmerman - whose father is white and mother is Peruvian - had racially-profiled Martin, and those who believed he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests broke out in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta following the verdict, though they were mostly peaceful. A large demonstration in New York yesterday attracted thousands of people, with placards that read, ``Jail racist killers, not black youth'', and ``We are all Trayvon. The whole damn system is guilty''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Obama, the first black US president, urged people to accept the trial verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,'' Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, California, protesters smashed windows and spray-painted cars after the verdict was announced live on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents - father Tracy and mother Sybrina Fulton - had before the trial asked the public to respect the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martin family's lawyer, Benjamin Crump, declined to say whether they would file a civil lawsuit against Zimmerman, but said ``they are going to certainly look at that as an option''.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far the protests have been largely peaceful. Thousands have turned out in cities across the US to lament the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the murder or manslaughter of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those on the streets cannot accept that a man can shoot dead a boy on his way home and not pay some penalty. Neither do they believe that race was not a factor in Martin's death and Mr Zimmerman's acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only in America can a dead black boy go on trial for his own murder,&quot; the New York writer Syreeta McFadden tweeted, capturing the protesters' mood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate has already fractured the US along familiar fault lines, with elements of the political left backing the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People's call for an investigation into possible civil rights violations, and the right accusing them of playing the race card. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department says it is restarting its investigation into the 2012 shooting of Martin to consider possible separate hate crime charges against Mr Zimmerman, The New York Times has reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tension is high and bleak memories of race riots that have plagued this country have been reawakened. In this context it is perhaps understandable that another crucial debate is being drowned out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People appear to have forgotten that when race first became a factor in this case it was because for six weeks after the shooting Mr Zimmerman was neither arrested nor charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In large part this was due to Florida's so-called stand-your-ground law, introduced in 2005, that made shooting people dead on that state's streets far more likely to be legal than it used to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is so often the case, Florida was an early adopter of a law being championed by conservative activists and, in this case, drafted by the National Rifle Association. Stand-your-ground laws, known by critics as shoot first laws, extend the so-called castle doctrine from the home to the street, making it legal to use lethal force against someone in public if you &quot;reasonably&quot; believe yourself to be at significant risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In doing so they reverse the onus of proof. Where once someone who killed a person had to prove they had acted in self-defence, under stand-your-ground laws the prosecution must prove the accused did not feel they were at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laws also expressly remove the requirement that once existed in the use of self-defence that a person retreat if given the opportunity. That is, under stand-your-ground laws, killing someone in a fight need not be the last option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, given that the sole witness to such incidents are often the accused and the person they have killed, stand-your-ground is proving quite a handy defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyer and former prosecutor Matt Mangino says that under stand-your-ground laws it could well be legal to get into a dispute with a neighbour, allow the quarrel to descend into a scuffle and, if you feared significant harm, to shoot him dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a case that is to be tried soon in the Florida town of Port St Joe, Walt Butler, a white man, is using stand-your-ground in his defence for shooting his neighbour Everett Gant, a coloured man who had confronted Mr Butler about a racial slur against a child in their apartment complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Butler shot Mr Gant between the eyes with a rifle, called police, then finished making his dinner, a local newspaper reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Maningo said he has come across cases in which drug dealers use stand-your-ground as a defence after shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Florida introduced its law, 30 other states - almost all of them conservative - have followed suit. Many simply copied Florida's legislation or used draft laws written by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group that seeds laws among the states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, Mr Zimmerman did not resort to the stand-your-ground argument in court, instead relying on straightforward self-defence. Nonetheless, the ease with which self-defence is invoked in murder cases is clearly on Floridians' minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than half an hour after the verdict on Mr Zimmerman was handed down, Florida's Senate's Democratic leader Chris Smith issued a statement calling for a re-examination of all self-defence laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that a child is dead and an armed man can now walk free without so much as a backward glance sends the wrong message to Florida and its citizens,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If someone makes the claim of self defence and the only other witness to the confrontation is dead, there needs to be a higher standard for proving that the use of deadly force was justified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little chance of any real debate in Florida, where the state legislature remains in the hands of the conservative Tea Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Columbia University law professor Jeffrey Fagan says stand-your-ground laws are perfectly suited to a conservative world view. They speak of mistrust of government and its agencies; they privatise public space and promote individualism at its most rugged, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He notes that they are an extension of a long history of American citizens using violence as self-help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lynchings, riots, civil disobedience and vigilantism are all expressions of individual or collective action that reject both legal norms and the authority of state actors,&quot; he has written.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murder rates have not risen in Florida since stand-your-ground laws were introduced, and supporters see this as evidence that they are working safely and as intended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man who has studied them more broadly, Texas A&amp;M University economist Mark Hoekstra, disagrees. &quot;These laws lower the cost of using lethal force,&quot; he told National Public Radio in January. &quot;Our study finds that homicides go up by 7 to 9 per cent in states that pass the laws, relative to states that didn't pass the laws, over the same time period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mr Zimmerman's case hinged on self-defence, stand-your-ground language still found its way into the court case, with instructions given to the jury declaring, &quot;If George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or another, or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As long as force meets deadly force, and as long as citizens are relieved of the &quot;duty to retreat&quot;, Professor Fagan expects more people to die as Trayvon&nbsp;Martin did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that Mr Zimmerman is eligible to have his handgun returned to him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thoughts from Monday morning:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zombies attack</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;World War Z&quot; was an interesting flick to watch. I saw it Friday night at Cinema 7. I would call it a horror movie with the pace of an action movie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is the suspense normally found in a horror movie, but the plot develops swiftly like in an action movie. These zombies don't stagger toward their victims like in all previous zombie movies. These undead run as fast as the living, eager to bite and infect their victims. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The living go to extremes to fend off these zombies, whether it is building big walls or throwing a grenade on an airplane or detonating nukes. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the film. Seriously, I was. The whole movie was a gut-wrenching thrill ride. I chomped popcorn like mad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leave the kids at home and go see it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice fails</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was not stunned by the verdict in the George Zimmerman case Saturday. Yes, I agree with so many people in the country that justice for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin was not served. Zimmerman got to chase down a teenager, scare the crap out of him, then kill him using the Stand Your Ground law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what happens if both people are standing their ground? That law presumes there is always one aggressor and one victim in altercations. I believe Martin was trying to stand his ground when he and Zimmerman got into a fight, except Martin didn't have a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law wasn't invoked by the defense at the trial, but Zimmerman knew of that law on that night in February 2012, granting him a vigilante attitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I am going to go chase somebody and end up in a fight, am I not the aggressor? The law shouldn't allow me to stand my ground when I am the pursuer. The law, if it must exist in the first place, ought to allow me to stand my ground when I am attacked and only after no provocation. Zimmerman provoked Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reasons I wasn't stunned by the verdict were:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. It's Florida. Nothing makes legal sense down there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. It doesn't take a legal beagle to know that quite often when justice isn't served in the South, it goes against the black people. Recall that two years ago Georgia executed Troy Davis despite serious doubts about his guilt. A former district judge even wrote: &quot;Serious questions about Mr. Davis' guilt, highlighted by witness recantations, allegations of police coercion and a lack of relevant physical evidence, continue to plague his conviction.&quot; Did these widespread concerns stop Georgia? Nope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A black kid is killed by a non-black man. Police conduct a lousy investigation. Prosecutors blunder the case. The all-white jury acquits. I'm not the only newspaper pundit who has pointed this out -- that the New South isn't exactly new. The tradition of screwing over African-Americans in Southern states through the justice system is a long and unjust one. Of course Florida would find Zimmerman not guilty. What else is new?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's hope the federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman are filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party pleases</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allow a few self-indulgent words this week, please: I want to thank Bob and Joyce Nixon for opening their home for a pizza party Saturday evening with Marion Ross as the guest of honor. What a lovely home you have. I enjoyed my conversation with Bob about wine while Joyce was being the lovely social butterfly she is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to name off many other people to thank, as well, but I am sure I would neglect someone. Besides, I'll just be up-front. I cannot remember the names of everyone I met. I will thank the committee that organized the soiree. Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also will thank Sara Aeikens for being my date and thank Leo Aeikens for being generous with his wife. By the way, my sons know them as Grandma Sara and Grandpa Leo, so they are kind of like family anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I did get to meet Marion Ross, who was lovely as ever. She deemed me old enough to know what &quot;Happy Days&quot; was. That's good, because I do remember &quot;Happy Days,&quot; &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley,&quot; &quot;Eight Is Enough,&quot; &quot;M--A--S--H,&quot; &quot;The Jeffersons,&quot; &quot;Sanford and Son,&quot; &quot;The Carol Burnett Show,&quot; &quot;All in the Family&quot; and many of those 1970s TV shows. &quot;Happy Days&quot; was on the air from 1974 to 1984, a pretty good run. And the reruns were called &quot;Happy Days Again.&quot; The reruns were our after-school entertainment in the early 1980s, along with &quot;Hogan's Heroes&quot; and &quot;The Brady Bunch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now I want to meet Alan Alda!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wife and kids</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My wife, Lisa, and my two sons, Forrest and Jasper, have been at the in-laws in Illinois for a month. It's not been easy being away from the family for so long, and today I finally see them again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My wife has been at her parents' home in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights. She is a triplet, and their July birthday is a national holiday. OK, it's not yet a national holiday, but it's getting there. (For the curious, she has an identical twin sister and a fraternal twin brother.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We missed each other dearly. Family is everything.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Americans are still in the eye of the storm, as the murder in cold blood of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and the acquittal of his killer demonstrates,<BR>writes Gamal Nkrumah</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,&quot; US President Barack Obama pontificated after the verdict concerning the fatal shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by George Zimmerman. Obama astounded African American compatriots and many progressive whites and non-whites across America. Institutionalised racism in the form of racial profiling of young black men is rife in the US today. This seething racial oppression long preceded the macabre Florida cold-blooded murder that conjured up an ataxia of testimony, and much grist for redoubtable doubt in the &quot;American Dream&quot; from which young African American males are doomed to exclusion. The Zimmerman verdict, in effect, allowed African-Americans to draw threads together and start making sense of the contradictions inherent in contemporary American society. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martin-Zimmerman case elicited &quot;strong passions&quot;, to paraphrase Obama, who appealed for calm reflection after the verdict. His pleas fell on deaf ears. Shortly after Zimmerman's acquittal was announced late Saturday, spontaneous protest marches erupted in cities across the United States. The largest were in New York and Los Angeles, but significant numbers also hit the streets in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington, Boston, San Diego and Atlanta. The verdict itself was a daredevil deed designed to provoke and stir up racial hatred. It was also a symptom and expression of the racism that rages throughout America. In New York, thousands of people marched to Times Square Sunday night, chanting &quot;Justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most demonstrations were motivated by overcoming the hurt and humiliation embodied in Martin's murder, and questioning the fairness of the US justice system, lauded by its functionaries as the fairest in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American dream is running out of steam. The ultimate danger of this scandalous case may be the doubt it raises in America and abroad over the US justice system. This is not, after all, an isolated case. &quot;The most fundamental of civil rights - the right to life - was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; says a petition on the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People) website. &quot;The whole world was looking at this case for a reason. We'd be intellectually dishonest if we didn't acknowledge the racial undertones,&quot; said Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diabolically absent is not only justice, but also political will to address these undertones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a typical African American teenager subjected to the racial profiling of young black males in the US. Zimmerman, in contrast, is the son of a Jewish judge - and that is of vital significance - and a Peruvian of African descent, a black woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Zimmerman is a private citizen, he can only be charged with a hate crime in terms of civil rights violations under federal law, extrapolated David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Florida, now in private practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To successfully prosecute Zimmerman, the Department of Justice would have to show that Zimmerman &quot;caused the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin solely motivated by/because of his race or colour,&quot; Weinstein told CNN in an e-mail. &quot;This element was absent from the state trial and quite frankly doesn't exist,&quot; he expounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we have to have very responsible conversations about how we get better as a country, and move forward from this tragedy, and learn from it,&quot; Weinstein summed up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of 26 February 2012, Martin was leisurely walking back to the house of his father's fianc&eacute; after going to a Sanford, Florida convenience store. Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch vigilante volunteer, spotted Martin, stalked Martin and called the police. Zimmerman and Martin soon got into a physical altercation after which Martin was shot dead. Attorneys aired competing theories during the trial about that fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was charged with second degree murder on 11 April 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, confidence in US President Obama has fast been waning in African American communities across the US. Obama weighed in on the controversy, saying about a month after Martin was killed that the incident required national &quot;soul-searching&quot;. The comment came to nothing. Obama has metamorphosed in office into just another US president - black or not, it does not matter in the least. His stymied plans to protect underprivileged and disadvantaged Americans has come to naught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martin murder evokes memories of the Rodney King case in 1991, when videotape of white Los Angeles police officers clubbing an African-American man after a deadly car chase prompted a bitter nationwide, race-tinged national hullabaloo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as in the case of Martin in Florida, justice was interrupted. A California criminal court failed to convict the officers filmed in acts of police brutality. Riots ensued in Los Angeles. The Justice Department then filed a civil rights suit against the officers, alleging &quot;deprivations of federal rights under colour of law,&quot; and two were convicted in 1993. A court sentenced them to 30 months in federal prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African American civil rights activists and human rights advocates in the US want Zimmerman's head, even though he has not conclusively been shown to have lied about the murder of Martin. Nevertheless, Weinstein warned that the Justice Department cannot file similar charges against Zimmerman because he is a private citizen, a neighbourhood vigilante, and not a police officer or government official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no other relevant sections under which to prosecute him,&quot; other than the hate crime statute, which covers &quot;offenses involving actual or perceived race, colour, religion, or national origin,&quot; Weinstein elucidated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Martin's family can still file a civil wrongful death lawsuit against Zimmerman to seek penalties and damages. Such a legal move carries no criminal penalty or prison time. Civil rights suits are conducted against government and not against individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US Attorney-General Eric Holder signalled the unlikelihood of filing federal hate crimes charges against Zimmerman. &quot;For a federal hate crime, we have to prove the highest standard in the law,&quot; Holder declared in April 2012, 45 days after Zimmerman shot Martin in what was described by civil rights activists as a racially motivated killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to show that there was specific intent to do the crime with requisite state of mind,&quot; Holder insisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Be that as it may, there is something amiss about the US justice system and judicial proceedings when a killing like that of Martin cannot be prosecuted effectively under law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury in the Martin-Zimmerman case consisted of five white females and one non-white female. It is not clear if the &quot;non-white&quot; was an African American or a Latina. Zimmerman's acquittal of state murder and manslaughter charges Saturday demonstrated that the Florida jury rejected the hypothesis that Zimmerman wilfully intended to kill Martin. Jurists concluded that there was no evidence of a racial motivation necessary for federal charges that he violated Martin's civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict only served to open new wounds. The fatal gunshot was a mortal blow to all the presumed gains of the American civil rights movement. The US might have a black president today, but the sad reality is that millions of African American males are persecuted and prosecuted, murdered and maimed under the eyes of the US justice system. In the case of Martin, by the time the police arrived on the murder scene, the hapless teenager was dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's controversial gun laws are also to blame. Gun laws in the US regulate the sale, possession and use of firearms and ammunition.&nbsp;State laws vary, and are independent of existing federal firearms laws. States like Massachusetts, where the death penalty does not apply, for example, are easier on gun laws than states like conservative and reactionary Florida. The latter is broader in scope, the former more limited than federal laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firearm owners in the US are subject to the firearm laws of the state they are in, and not exclusively their state of residence. Reciprocity is not always guaranteed. For instance, Idaho recognises an Oregon permit, but Oregon does not recognise an Idaho permit. Florida, among the most right wing of US states, issues a license to carry both concealed weapons and firearms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is another sinister aspect to the Martin-Zimmerman case: the rivalry between Latinos and African Americans. The political dimension of Latino resurgence in American society is literally spiralling inexorably. And, nowhere more so than in Florida. From the start, prosecutors faced a difficult case; weak on evidence and long on public outrage. Zimmerman had the power of self-defence laws on his side. And Zimmerman was amply assisted by a dubious police investigation and doubtful prosecutorial missteps. The initial investigation foundered when the local prosecutor balked at bringing charges, convinced that overcoming the self-defence claims would prove impossible. Zimmerman, as the television cameras showed, could not suppress an infuriating smirk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, six weeks after the killing, Angela Corey, out of the blue, charged Zimmerman with second degree murder; a tall order as far as Florida is concerned. No one knows who had thrown the first punch and when precisely Zimmerman drew his gun against the unarmed Martin. There were no witnesses to the shooting and no definitive determination of which man could be heard pleading for help in the background of a 911 call. That it was impossible to tell the voice of a teenage African American from a Latino in his late twenties is in itself inexplicable, and an outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African American males in the US are vulnerable. Martin must have known it. Indeed, the only version of events came from Zimmerman, who did not take the stand, denying prosecutors a chance to cross-examine him. His statements to the police spoke for him at the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman claimed that he shot Martin only after the teenager knocked him to the ground, punched him, straddled him and slammed his head into the concrete - cynically dubbed a &quot;weapon,&quot; as Zimmerman's lawyer, Mark O'Mara, described it. The proof of Martin's ill intentions was that he was loitering about in the rain with his sweatshirt's hood up. Zimmerman ostensibly grew suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Punks,&quot; Zimmerman was reported as saying, adding yet another a profanity. &quot;They always get away.&quot; Zimmerman sounded curiously calm during the call he made to the police, and did not mention Martin's race until he was asked. The testimony of Rachel Jeantel, a young friend of Martin's who said he had told her on the phone that he was being followed and was scared, was dismissed as irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moral of this sordid story is that the supposed gains made by African Americans in the heyday of the civil rights movement are fast turning into handicaps to their social and economic advancement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murdering African American males is a recurring pattern and may become the ultimate tragedy of a long-suffering people who were brought to America as slaves, endured the horrors of bondage, denied the right to vote and suffered the indignity of being treated as second hand citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that American society is intent on keeping African Americans as underdogs, with or without a black president. That is just an inconsequential charade.</SPAN></P>

ANKARA &nbsp; Anadolu&nbsp;Agency does not verify these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. Balyoz' coup case appeal trial&nbsp; ' Most of dailies covered Tuesday the start of&nbsp;Balyoz&nbsp;(Sledgehammer ) appeal hearing&nbsp;of more than 300 military officers held in Supreme Court of Appeals Monday. &quot;The last turn in&nbsp;Balyoz&nbsp;case&quot; titled daily&nbsp;TARAF&nbsp;and said&nbsp;verdicts of guilty would&nbsp;become definite if the punishments were&nbsp;approved by the court.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdicts will be guiding for the case of&nbsp;Ergenekon, as the daily published. Daily&nbsp;RADIKAL&nbsp;pointed out that the case started with crisis as the court decided to hear the appeals in surname order. A group of protesters supporting the&nbsp;defendants in the case carried out a&nbsp;&quot;standing man&quot; protest&nbsp;just in front of the headquarters of the General Staff, daily STAR published. The trials&nbsp;will keep on non-stop during the judicial recess as well, according to what daily&nbsp;ZAMAN&nbsp;published. The trials will be held 4 days a week, as daily HABER TURK published, and the defendants will not be allowed in the hearings. &nbsp; &quot;Bad news from&nbsp;UEFA&quot; Almost all of the dailies covered the decision of&nbsp;European soccer's governing body the Union of European Football Associations' (UEFA) on&nbsp;match-fixing accusations against Turkish soccer teams&nbsp;Besiktas&nbsp;and&nbsp;Feenrbahce.&nbsp;Daily&nbsp;MILLIYET&nbsp;headlined&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bad news from&nbsp;UEFA&quot; referring to the announcement of&nbsp;UEFA's&nbsp;Appeals Body&nbsp;about the&nbsp;decisions&nbsp;following the appeals lodged by&nbsp;Besiktas&nbsp;and&nbsp;Fenerbahce&nbsp;against&nbsp;UEFA&nbsp;Control and Disciplinary Body&nbsp;verdicts issued in June.&nbsp;Besiktas&nbsp;is&nbsp;not eligible to participate in the 2013/14&nbsp;UEFA&nbsp;Europa League while&nbsp;Fenerbahce&nbsp;is&nbsp;excluded from participating in the next two&nbsp;UEFA&nbsp;club competitions they qualify for, including the 2013/14&nbsp;UEFA&nbsp;Champions League, as daily HABER TURK said. Both clubs will&nbsp;appeal the decisions of the&nbsp;UEFA&nbsp;Appeals Body to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), published daily&nbsp;VATAN.&nbsp; 35 detained in prison&nbsp;raid in Istanbul&nbsp; Some dailies also covered the police raid in Istanbul's&nbsp;Kartal&nbsp;Silivri&nbsp;semi-open prison, as well as&nbsp;Maltepe&nbsp;and&nbsp;Metris&nbsp;prisons. Investigations into a gang revealed a network of&nbsp;bribery in the mentioned prisons, as daily&nbsp;AKSAM&nbsp;said. During the operations by&nbsp;anti-organised crime police, 35 people were detained including directors and&nbsp;guardians. Daily&nbsp;RADIKAL&nbsp;published that the warden of the&nbsp;Silivri&nbsp;prison was also detained together with 14 other officers and 20&nbsp;gangsters adding the operation might reach some&nbsp;public prosecutors. It is claimed the suspects brought guns, drugs, and cell phones into the prison, says daily&nbsp;ZAMAN. Zimmerman&nbsp; George Zimmerman, the Florida man, killed&nbsp;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a black teenager, last year.&nbsp;Thousands of people took to the streets protesting against&nbsp;Martin's case in U.S. in which the&nbsp;jury&nbsp;determined&nbsp;Zimmerman&nbsp;acted in self-defence, despite the fact Martin was unarmed. &quot;Black anger&quot; is what daily&nbsp;YENI&nbsp;SAFAK&nbsp;published saying that the case has inflamed racial tensions. Many American protesters marched along U Street in capital Washington&nbsp;and chanted slogans &quot;Justice for Martin&quot; and &quot;No peace if no justice&quot;, the daily said.&nbsp;In&nbsp;Los&nbsp;Angeles, as daily&nbsp;ZAMAN&nbsp;published, demonstrators blocked one of the busiest roads in the city while in Oakland of California some burned&nbsp;U.S. flag and demolished vehicles as well as workplaces. The daily also said 12 protesters were detained at Union Square in New York. Technical error in CNN &quot;CNN embarrassed in Ankara,&nbsp;shameless&nbsp;in London&quot; headlined daily STAR saying CNN&nbsp;broadcasted&nbsp;the videos of sympathy rallies for Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip&nbsp;Erdogan&nbsp;in Istanbul's&nbsp;Kazlicesme&nbsp;arena as if they were the videos of anti-government protests. The daily quoted&nbsp;Senior Vice President for&nbsp;CNN&nbsp;Parisa&nbsp;Khosravi&nbsp;as saying &quot;It was a&nbsp;technical&nbsp;error,&nbsp;there is no intention.&quot; The&nbsp;public relations department, on the other hand, tweeted that they did not apologise for what they did. englishnews@aa.com.tr</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---Chuck Ellet, Dunwoody</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Former Alcoa CEO Paul O'Neill implemented a system in the early 1990s in which the company could close its books several days &quot;faster, fully audited,&quot; than it had previously done. &quot;O'Neill gave then-Alcoa controller Earnest Edwards license to redesign our systems,&quot; Monica Orbe, the company's director of corporate affairs told Q&amp;A on the News in an email. The change took a year, she added, but the &quot;accelerated close freed up an enormous amount of analytical talent in finance.&quot; That allowed Alcoa to begin the quarterly earnings season, starting in 1996, according to the company's annual report that year. Alcoa is one of 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: I have been unable to find out, and have not heard, if Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a resident of the gated community where he was shot. If not, why was he there?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---Judy Michel, Alpharetta</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Martin lived in Miami Gardens, Fla., and attended Miami's Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, but was visiting The Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford, Fla., with his father, Tracy Martin. Tracy Martin's fiancee, Brandy Green, lived in the gated townhome complex, and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin reportedly had visited there several times. He was returning to Green's townhome after walking to a nearby convenience store when he was shot and killed on Feb. 26, 2012. Sanford is a suburb of Orlando, Fla.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no winners in the trial of George Zimmerman. The only question is whether the damage that has been done has been transient or irreparable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legally speaking, Zimmerman has won his freedom. But he can still be sued in a civil case, and he will probably never be safe to live his life in peace, as he could have before this case made him the focus of national attention and orchestrated hate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important than the fate of George Zimmerman, however, is the fate of the American justice system and of the public's faith in that system and in their country. People who have increasingly asked, during the lawlessness of the Obama administration, &quot;Is this still America?&quot; may feel some measure of relief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the very fact that this case was brought in the first place, in an absence of serious evidence --- which became ever more painfully obvious as the prosecution strained to try to come up with anything worthy of a murder trial --- will be of limited encouragement as to how long this will remain America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political perversion of the criminal justice system began early and at the top, with the President of the United States. Unlike other public officials who decline to comment on criminal cases that have not yet been tried in court, Barack Obama chose to say, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a clever way to play the race card, as he had done before, when Professor Henry Louis Gates of Harvard was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it did not stop there. After the local police in Florida found insufficient evidence to ask for Zimmerman to be prosecuted, the Obama administration sent Justice Department investigators to Sanford, Fla., and also used the taxpayers' money to finance local activists who agitated for Zimmerman to be arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political intervention did not end with the federal government. The city manager in Sanford intervened to prevent the usual police procedures from being followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the question arose of identifying the voice of whoever was calling for help during the confrontation between Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and George Zimmerman, the normal police procedure would have been to let individuals hear the recording separately, rather than have a whole family hear it together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you want to get each individual's honest opinion, you don't want that opinion to be influenced by others who are present, much less allow a group to coordinate what they are going to say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the city manager took this out of the hands of the police, and had Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family, plus Rachel Jeantel, all hear the recording together, that's politics, not law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was just one of the ways that this case looked like something out of &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot; Both in the courtroom and in the media, educated and apparently intelligent people repeatedly said things that they seemed sincerely, and even fervently, to believe, but which were unprovable and often even unknowable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the testimony of prosecution witness after prosecution witness undermined the prosecution's own case. Some critics faulted the prosecuting attorneys. But the prosecutors had to work with what they had --- and they had no hard evidence that would back up a murder charge or even a manslaughter charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You don't send people to prison on the basis of what other people imagine, or on the basis of media sound bites like &quot;shooting an unarmed child,&quot; when that &quot;child&quot; was beating him bloody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury indicated, early on as their deliberations began, that they wanted to compare hard evidence, when they asked for a complete list of the testimony on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the issue boiled down to hard, provable facts, the prosecutors' loud histrionic assertions and sweeping innuendoes were just not going to cut it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor was repeatedly calling Zimmerman a liar effective, especially when the prosecution misquoted what Zimmerman said, as an examination of the record would show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only real heroes in this trial were the jurors. They showed that this is still America --- at least for now --- despite politicians who try to cheapen or corrupt the law, as if this were some banana republic. Some are already calling for a federal indictment of George Zimmerman, after he has been acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will this still be America then?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Former Falcon sees need for change after Zimmerman acquittal.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have witnessed many, particularly in recent days in the mine field of social media, who react first and think later (maybe). Warrick Dunn isn't one of those. He doesn't require a filter between his brain and his fingertips before sharing a thought on Twitter or a pause button before speaking publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He thinks. He measures his words. He proves it's possible to lead with one's heart without leading with one's emotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunn has been on both sides of the looking glass. He was raised in a rough neighborhood but he attended a predominantly white Catholic high school in Baton Rouge, La. He witnessed violence and crime on an almost daily basis. Friends died. But as the son of a police officer, he also grew up with an appreciation for the law and the people who try to give our world order. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't preach to Dunn about pain, about what's unfair or unjust. His mother, a police officer, was shot and killed during a robbery 20 years ago when she drove a grocery store manager to the bank to make a night deposit. Don't preach to Dunn about everything being the result of racial injustice. When his mother was taken from him, it had nothing to do with race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not everything is about black and white, it's about right and wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm black. A black man killed my mother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunn was sitting in his office Monday. The former NFL running back is now an accomplished businessman and philanthropist. He earned his MBA from Emory. He holds minority ownership in the Falcons and oversees his three charities --- Home for the Holidays (which rewards single-parent families with first-time home ownership), the all-encompassing Warrick Dunn Charities, and Betty's Hope (a children's bereavement program named for his late mother, Betty Smothers).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like others, Dunn also has leaped into the world of social media and was criticized by some in the past few days for a couple of simple comments he made on Twitter related to the Florida murder trial that saw George Zimmerman found not guilty in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first tweet: &quot;Speechless.&quot; The second: &quot;My heart goes out to the Martin family.&quot; It doesn't take much to start a fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's rare for Dunn to take a strong public stance on a subject so combustible. This is one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't agree with it,&quot; he said of the Zimmerman verdict. &quot;I think he should've been found guilty. I think everybody would've been (content) with manslaughter --- it didn't have to be second-degree murder. But not guilty is not the right call.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He referenced two high-profile cases involving NFL players: Michael Vick &quot;went to jail for killing dogs,&quot; Dunn said. &quot;Plaxico Burress went to prison for shooting himself in the leg. Seriously?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the verdict was broadcast live late Saturday night, Dunn was at his home in Tampa, Fla., a two-hour drive from the courthouse in Sanford. He had several friends over --- friends of different races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A diverse group,&quot; he said. &quot;There were a lot of smart people in the room. When the verdict was read, we were just all shocked. We were in awe. Nobody knew what to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was about a year ago, Dunn recalled, when he received a message on Twitter that read, &quot;Somebody killed my friend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was talking about Trayvon,&quot; Dunn said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunn started following the case. He fully admits to not knowing every detail about the investigation. But he believes he devoured enough of the news reports to come up with an educated opinion. He also has strong feelings against Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, although that was not procedurally a part of the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody wants to understand the facts. The people who are protesting or speaking out on Twitter just wanted justice to be served,&quot; he said. &quot;This isn't about race. ... People are saying, 'Sure, what if a black man killed a white man?' But Zimmerman isn't even white --- he's Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People have the right to carry a firearm. But if somebody is walking away and a man follows him (and shoots him), how is that not second-degree murder or manslaughter?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're instructed to walk away and you do it anyway, then what? To me, if you disregard all authority and you do it anyway, everything else goes out the window. If there's a fight going on and you're defending yourself, that's one thing. But when he didn't listen to the 911 operator and gets out of the car, that's a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've opened up a whole new can of worms. They've set a precedent with this law for somebody killing somebody and getting away with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunn had just turned 18 when his mother was killed. (The man who killed her is in a Louisiana penitentiary.) She was 36. Today would've been her 57th birthday. Her profession gave Dunn a unique perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand the grind that people in law enforcement go through,&quot; he said. &quot;They want to protect and serve, and they want to be able to go home to their families and say, 'I'm OK.' When I see a police officer the first thing I always say is, 'Be careful.' I know the sadness I had for so many years. I can feel for the parents who've lost somebody. I understand their struggle. I've gone to counseling for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are just scared. You have all these athletes like (Falcons receiver) Roddy (White) who are tweeting, reacting emotionally. But when they step back, they just want what's best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White tweeted, &quot;All them jurors should go home tonight and kill themselves for letting a grown man get away with killing a kid.&quot; He apologized the next day, acknowledging his tweet &quot;was extreme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunn isn't sure how his mother would've reacted to the verdict, but said, &quot;She would've made sure she understood all of the facts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At some point, he said he might reach out to Martin's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe after things settle down, after all of the protests and everything,&quot; he said. &quot;I know they're going through a lot emotionally. They wanted justice. Their family will never have peace. Maybe I can help them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">AN APPEAL TO REASON; <BR>DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN MISGUIDED HYSTERIA AFTER ZIMMERMAN VERDICT</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. A4</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">562 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who's hounding whom now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The very people who bitterly complain that George Zimmerman stalked Trayvon&nbsp;Martin now seem intent on dogging Zimmerman, even after a jury acquitted him in what everyone concedes was a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say they want justice, but only if it leads to the outcome they expect. The justice system spoke for itself, and on Saturday found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we warned in an editorial Saturday, those who tuned in to the former mainstream media were exposed to a perverted view of the case that presented the prosecution in an unrealistically favorable light - and were likely shocked by the outcome as a result. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was not only riddled with conflicting evidence and reasonable doubt, but also arguably some pretty compelling evidence that Zimmerman was being beaten before shooting Martin - which would buttress Zimmerman's claim of self-defense. As other news outlets reported long ago, the physical evidence indicated wounds on Zimmerman's face and head - and on Martin's knuckles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is any reasonable belief that Zimmerman was defending himself - and there is - then the jury was duty-bound to acquit him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in the face of such facts, the former mainstream media just couldn't resist selling the story line that this was a racial incident reminiscent of America's inglorious past. Many in the left-wing media seem to want that past to be true today. They want to believe the worst in America. They're not interested in the evidence. It gets in the way of a good, self-loathing story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no evidence that Zimmerman had any racist tendencies whatsoever. In fact, there was evidence to the contrary, with one black witness calling Zimmerman a friendly neighbor. FBI reports say the police concluded Zimmerman was an &quot;overzealous&quot; neighborhood watchman who exhibited &quot;a little hero complex, but not as a racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the only racist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">intonations in the trial came from Trayvon&nbsp;Martin himself, who used a racial slur in describing Zimmerman to a friend on the phone just before the fateful encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These facts, and many more, not only point clearly to a verdict of not guilty, but also bring into question the pretext for the charges. As strongly as Mr. Martin's supporters feel about the verdict, many folks believe just as strongly that this case was filed as much for political reasons as legal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, even after the verdict, some still want to hound Zimmerman, urging the U.S. Department of Justice to put him on trial again for violating Martin's civil rights - again, in the face of absolutely no evidence of racial motivation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This mob-like pound-of-flesh incitement on the part of some is causing a hysteria that leads to civil unrest and irrational statements such as one protester's lament of &quot;58 years, and nothing's changed.&quot; That's just lunacy. And it's a particularly perilous genre of fiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders appealed for calm before and after the verdict, while not really achieving it. What we might want to appeal for is reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman is not a cop, and he should've left law enforcement to the law enforcers. He should never have followed anyone as he did. But our hounding him makes just as little sense. The jury has spoken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither this case nor its conclusion have anything relevant or coherent to say about race relations in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, the reaction to it does.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samuel H. Atkins Jr. was reported missing by his wife about 11 a.m. Mon-day, McDuffie County Sheriff Logan Marshall said. Marshall said he entered Atkins' name in the national missing persons database and that the results showed the body was found in Franklin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sgt. Don Willis, of the Macon County Sheriff's Office in North Carolina, said Atkins was found in a car on the shoulder of the road with a gunshot wound. Mar-shall said the wound appeared to be self-inflicted. The vehicle had been involved in an accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arena managers get new contract</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Augusta-Richmond County Coliseum Authority has renewed its contract with management company Glo-bal Spectrum and in-house catering and concession company Ovations Food Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contracts were extended five years, according to a news release. The companies have been servicing James Brown Arena and Bell Auditorium since 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authority Chairman Ced-ric Johnson said the authority was pleased with the work of the companies during their first five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They not only have brought in great entertainment, but they are involved in the community, which is something very important to the Augusta-Richmond County Coliseum Authority,&quot; Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photos released of two men in scam</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have released photos of two people who cheated an Augusta woman out of money and are asking for the public's help to catch them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Rich-mond County Sheriff's Office, the two men approached the 74-year-old woman at the North Au-gus-ta Wal-Mart on May 20 and asked for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They persuaded her that they would give her a large sum of money if she contributed some of her own money to theirs and then prayed over it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said she drove the men to Augusta and withdrew money from two banks and went to her home for an additional $500. Before leaving Wal-Mart, the men said they would leave the money in her vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After returning to Augusta, she learned she had been deceived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men were captured on surveillance video at Wal-Mart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone with information is asked to contact the sheriff's office at (706) 821-1080.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two men robbed a couple Sunday night as they returned to their home in the 2900 block of Point West Drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a news release, the husband and wife were approaching the front door of their home about 11:30 p.m. when two men with guns ran from beside the home.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other stories have emerged to breathe some life into the sporting world during the dog days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you, Jordan Spieth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's bunker shot heard round the world screamed to the golfing populace that the sport has a fresh new face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven months to the day after he turned pro, the 19-year-old former Texas Longhorn won the John Deere Classic in electrifying fashion, with an impossible shot out of the sand on the final hole of regulation before winning on the fifth playoff hole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spieth became the first teenager to win a PGA Tour event since the Great Depression, and it was nice to see him break through in such impressive fashion to earn a British Open spot and that fat check for $828,000. It was even nicer to see him win in old-school fashion, using a putter that was nowhere near his belly or chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why is the PGA Tour waiting until 2016 to ban these extended putters? The most respect goes to the players who are able to overcome their nerves and shaky wrists to make meaningful putts to win big-time tournaments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Ernie Els once famously said about his use of a belly putter: &quot;As long as it's legal, I'll keep cheating like the rest of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest Johnny Manziel news comes from Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, La., where the Aggie quarterback's gig as a counselor/coach at the prestigious Manning Passing Academy was cut short by a day. Some reports stated the 20-year-old Manziel had stayed out late partying, leading to his dismissal by Manning patriarch Archie Manning, but a statement from the academy suggested otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After missing and being late for practice assignments, Johnny explained that he had been feeling ill,&quot; the statement read. &quot;Consequently, we agreed that it was in everyone's best interest for him to go home a day early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then this: Manziel pleaded guilty Monday to failing to identify himself to police after a June 2012 fight. Beyond the misdemeanor charge, he has pretty much kept his nose clean over the past year, outside of a couple Twitter battles and his shove of a grad assistant - who was celebrating an interception thrown by Manziel - during a spring scrimmage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manziel's busy social schedule since he won the Heisman Trophy hasn't gone unnoticed. There are too many red flags popping up around him, and it could hurt his draft prospects with NFL teams. Not a good development for an undersized QB who has questionable arm strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions about his focus will be asked, although the Johnny Football hype will only gain steam this fall because his social media impact already has made him the third-most scrutinized Heisman winner in history behind O.J. Simpson and Tim Tebow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former NBA player Chris Herren will be in Austin on Wednesday to share his story of basketball, drug addiction, recovery and redemption during a stop at the LBJ Presidential Library.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herren starred at Fresno State and was drafted by the Boston Celtics in 1994, but his NBA career was cut short, largely because of drug addiction. After cleaning up, Herren became a motivational speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herren's talk, scheduled for 8:30 p.m., will be presented by the Last Resort Recovery Center and the Center for Students in Recovery ... UT Austin. Admission is free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I spoke with Herren over the weekend, and he is excited about sharing his story. I can't wait to hear him because he pulls no punches with his message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're interested in hearing him, I recommend some advance homework. Watch &quot;Unguarded,&quot; ESPN's gritty 30 for 30 documentary that chronicled Herren's 17-year struggle with substance abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several pro athletes responded with shock and disappointment to the news that George Zimmerman had been acquitted of murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Michael Vick, who did two years in prison for operating an illegal dogfighting ring, had this to say:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel so bad for the Martin fam,&quot; he wrote. &quot;We have a long way to go in America but please yall don't do anything stupid. Let God be the final judge.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">466  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A juror from the trial of Florida neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman for the death of unarmed black teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin said the six-woman panel was sharply divided when deliberations began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors ultimately came to a unanimous decision, finding Zimmerman not guilty on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the case that has brought tough questions about racism in the United States back to the fore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in an interview on CNN, juror B-37 -- who was not named and was shown in deep shadow -- said the first vote was split down the middle between those who wanted an acquittal and those who wanted to convict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had three not guilties, one second degree murder and two manslaughters,&quot; the juror said, adding she was one of the ones who voted not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman -- who has a white father and a Peruvian mother -- said he acted in self-defense when he shot Martin during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But prosecutors said he profiled and stalked Martin, provoking the altercation that led to Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror said ultimately it became a question of whether the events leading up the shooting were legally relevant or if, for self-defense, it is the moment before pulling the trigger that counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was just so confusing with what and what we could apply to what. Because I mean, there was a couple of them in there that wanted to find him guilty of something,&quot; the juror said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;after hours and hours and hours of deliberating over the law and reading it over and over and over again, we decided there's just no way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror explained her understanding of what happened that night: &quot;I think George got in a little bit too deep.... He shouldn't have been there. But Trayvon decided that he wasn't going to let him scare him and get the one up on him or something. And I think Trayvon got mad and attacked him,&quot; the juror said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had no doubt George feared for his life in the situation he was in at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she broke into tears as she described the mental anguish she and the other jurors felt as they weighed their decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a tragedy this happened, but it happened. And I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves in to. I think both of them could have walked away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of the verdict, race again came to the fore, with angry protesters asking if the result would have been the same had Martin been white and Zimmerman black. &quot;We are all Trayvon,&quot; some cried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the juror said the panel of five white and one Hispanic women didn't discuss race and she did not believe it was a factor in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Debra Nelson ruled at the outset that prosecutors could not say that Zimmerman had profiled Martin on the basis of race, and the topic was rarely discussed in the trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following is a selection of quotes from editorials and commentaries published in 16 July editions of Iranian newspapers available to BBC Monitoring at 0530 gmt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rouhani must continue Ahmadinezhad's legacy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Javan [conservative]: &quot;During a recent meeting, [Iran's] Supreme Leader [Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i] praised the achievements of the ninth and tenth governments [of President Mahmud Ahmadinezhad] as impressive. He did this while some foreign enemies and some prejudiced agents inside the country used the current problems as a pretext to undermine this government's achievements and Ahmadinezhad's determined endeavour during the past eight years... The question is whether the Supreme Leader's appreciation for [Ahmadinezhad's] government is only meant to appease these statesmen or is there a background to this admiration and gratitude? The Supreme Leader, by showing his appreciation for the outgoing government, tried to attract the attention of the next government to the values and principles which all governments should take into account... Ahmadinezhad and his government were true representatives of revolutionary slogans and values... The next government is therefore obligated to follow the correct path taken by the ninth and tenth governments and to refuse to give up an iota of these values and the legacy of the late Imam [Khomeyni].&quot; (Commentary by Hassan Rashvand headlined: &quot;Reward of eight years continuous efforts&quot;) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rouhani - reformist or principle-ist?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mardom Salari [moderate]: &quot;The debate over whether [President-elect] Hassan Rouhani is a reformist or a principle-ist is still going on one month after the presidential election... But in reality, why is it important to answer this question - which has dominated the political narrative of country for the last month - of which group is represented by Rouhani? It seems that Hassan Rouhani should be considered a representative of both the modern and the traditional middle classes in Iranian society... But after his victory, both spectrums [reformist and principle-ist] know well that soon Rouhani will have to face reality. At this stage, he should move towards realization of his objectives and campaign slogans by forming a cabinet. Therefore, the composition of his cabinet and its [political] leaning will be important for both spectrums from the perspective of realizing his election goals and slogans... The dispute over whether Rouhani is a reformist or principle -ist is not an insignificant one as it carries tangible political, social and economic consequences. Therefore, we can see that some principle-ists are already noticing Rouhani's attention to issues like civil rights and other demands of the middle class, while reformists are stressing the necessity of their demands by raising the importance of the formation and enforcement of social institutions. But will Mr Rouhani succeed in following and realizing simultaneously the demands of the modern and traditional social classes without tension as he promised during his campaign?&quot; (Editorial by Mehdi Ghavamipur headlined: &quot;Rouhani, reformist or principle -ist?&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rouhani's looming budget conundrum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arman [moderate]: &quot;It has been four months since the start of the new Iranian year [21 March], however, not only the government of incumbent President [Mahmud Ahmadinezhad] appears to have no intention of increasing the prices of energy sources, it has also transferred the responsibility for increasing the prices of other commodities such as bread and some other staple food items to the new government [incoming administration of president-elect Hassan Rouhani]. This will result in the government having to face a challenging dilemma. First option: The president-elect can avoid increasing the prices of energy sources as required by the law. However, the law-abiding jurist-turned-president is unlikely to avoid implementing the law. Second option: He can abide by the law and suddenly increase the prices of energy sources by at least two-fold and also increase the prices of bread and other staple food items...But there is another option: He can honestly inform the people of the problems and provide real statistics - a measure expected from an honest and righteous government. [He can] ask the wise people of our country, from villagers to urban dwellers, to [voluntarily] stop receiving subsidies [monthly allowances provided to Iranian families under the subsidy reform plan] or give the government at least six months to pay their demands.&quot; (Editorial by Mohsen Bahrami Arz Aqdas, headlined: &quot;The difference between two presidents&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party interference in cabinet selection?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hemayat [conservative]: &quot;For the past few days, the issue of selecting the 11th cabinet has attracted the attention of political actors... Most people are waiting to see whom [President-elect Hassan] Rouhani will select. On the other hand, they [referring to political parties] have expressed willingness to provide the president-elect with advice about the cabinet... some have even proposed lists... It is worth pointing out that the president-elect has not asked any parties to give him lists... Some opine that our system is not a party system and thus parties have no influence on the selection of cabinet [members]; therefore, it is better that they not introduce their cabinet nominees. If they provide the president with a list, they will be accused of seeking representation [in the cabinet] and limiting the president.&quot; (Editorial by Mohammad Riza Rah Chemani headlined &quot;Parties and cabinet&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iran-UK ties</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E'temand[ reformist]: &quot;It seems that with the shock of the election of Dr Hassan Rouhani as the president of the Islamic Republic, a situation similar to the situation of 1376 [1997; when Mohammad Khatami became the reformist president of Iran] has been paved for the UK and Europe to use shock-therapy to normalize their ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The recent stances adopted by UK's former and current officials , such as the willingness of former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw to visit Iran and [Current Foreign Secretary] William Hague's comments on improving ties with Iran, indicate that the UK wants to use this opportunity to normalize ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Earlier, France had also talked about the possibility of inviting President-elect [Hassan Rouhani] to participate in the Geneva-2 Conference [on Syria]. Therefore, it can be claimed that the official and non-official statements by British and European officials are a sign of the start of a diplomatic U-turn in Iran-UK and Iran-Europe ties under the moderate government [reference to Hassan Rouhani's government].&quot; (Editorial by Seyyed Jalal Dehqani Ferozabadi headlined: &quot;Therapeutic shock in Iran-UK ties&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third Palestinian Intifada?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resalat [conservative]: &quot;US Secretary of State John Kerry is afraid of a third Palestinian Intifada (uprising). This comes at a time when Palestinians and resistance groups are willing to continue their resistance against the Zionist regime...The reality is that peace talks between the Zionist regime and the Palestinian Authority (PA) had failed from the very beginning. Not only are these talks not beneficial to the Palestinians, but they also deprive them of the opportunity to achieve their ideals and goals. Therefore, most Palestinians do not agree to the talks. On the other hand, Palestinians have reached the conclusion that they can meet their objectives through resistance. That's why [former Israeli PM Ehud] Olmert and [Israeli MP Shaul] Mofaz have expressed concern over the possibility of a third Palestinian Intifada, because the Third Intifada will be against the Zionist regimes' policies and measures.&quot; (Commentary by Ali Reza Sadiqi headlined &quot;Kerry's fear of a third Intifada&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egyptian army could end up as loser</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keyhan [hard-line]: &quot;[The Egyptian] army claims to have arrived on the scene only for the sake of saving the country, but reliable news sources show that contrary to what has been said, there is a correlation between the growing number of people on Tahrir Square and the gradual appearance of the army... The Egyptian army has come out from the shadows. This can be considered an achievement for a strong Egyptian army which is repeating past experience. At the same time, such involvement carries serious risks for the army as well. In case the army is unable to establish stability in Egypt, it will end up being the biggest loser... If the army is unable to manage the situation in Egypt, it will not be able to control protests within the coming weeks or months, because time will run out for the army to effectively exert its authority over its opponents and because domestic and foreign powers will lose hope that the army can control the situation.&quot; (Commentary by Sadollah Zarei headlined : &quot;Egyptian army winner or loser of the crisis?&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian crisis to disrupt Iran-Turkey energy ties?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharq [reformist]: &quot;One of the most important tasks the next president will have to take care of is the drafting of 'energy diplomacy' to prevent disagreements over foreign policy from having an impact on Iran's energy exports... Syria's domestic developments are considered one of the most important and possible disruptive factors in Iran-Turkey ties in the field of energy... In fact, Iran and Turkey's stances are considered as the two possible options for resolving the Syrian crisis; one [Turkey] believes in the overthrow of Bashar al-Asad as well as changing the existing political system and for this purpose, it has become the most important source for providing intelligence and military services support to Syrian opposition groups, while the other [Iran] believes in keeping Bashar al-Asad [in power] and [keeping] the existing system.&quot; (Commentary by Mansur Mo'azami headlined: &quot;Difference and relationships&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel fears &quot;democratic&quot; Iran</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khorasan [conservative]: &quot;You [Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu] and your overlord [USA] do not fear the atomic bomb, but rather fear a nation increasing in power which, by achieving 72 per cent voter turnout in an election that met standards higher than even those countries that claim to be the [champions] of democracy, has consciously elected their president in a free and transparent election... You cannot hide your domestic problems under the flag of Iranophobia this time... All the people, young and old, republic and president, are lions in the Islamic republic of Iran and the wolves [Israel] have felt the bite of the lions. If you are wise, which I doubt, then you should avoid standing against [Iran] otherwise you will feel the result.&quot; (Editorial by Gholam Reza Bani Asadi headlined &quot;We are lions, Mr wolf!&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jomhuri-ye Eslami [hard-line]: &quot;A Florida jury has found George Zimmerman, the killer of black American teen Trayvon Martin, innocent... This decision has angered Americans, especially the blacks and has set off a wave of demonstrations in various states... His [Trayvon Martin's] death was the beginning of one of the most controversial court cases in the USA. Many people in the USA have accused the court and the country's legal system of racism and bias towards Zimmerman since he was white.&quot; (Commentary by News Service headlined &quot;Massive protests in the US despite the acquittal of murderer of a black teen&quot;)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Editorial: &quot;Zimmerman Verdict Will Trigger a Racial Debate&quot;] </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a matter of grave concern that Florida's 'Stand your ground' law seems to apply to some people, but not to others. A jury yesterday dismissed all charges against George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer, who fatally shot the unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same week, Marissa Alexander, who had fired warning shots at her abusive husband, was sentenced to 20 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both defendants used the same defence, the Florida 'Stand your Ground' law, which is based on the principle that a person may justifiably use force in self-defence when there is reasonable belief of an unlawful threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real danger in the two cases is that they will ignite a furious racial debate across the whole of America since Zimmerman's successful defence may be overshadowed by his white colour and the losing defence of Alexander by her black colour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implication of the two cases is that the law works for some (white security guards), but not for others (black abused women), and this is deeply dangerous. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be vigils and rallies in 100 US cities this weekend to press for federal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman over the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, the Rev Al Sharpton said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prominent civil rights activist announced the plan at a news conference with several church ministers outside the Justice Department in Washington. He did not say which cities would be involved, but did say the rallies and vigils will be staged on Saturday at federal buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal over the weekend touched off protests around the country.The Justice Department is investigating whether he violated the black teenager's civil rights when he shot the 17-year-old during a confrontation in Sanford, Florida, in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighbourhood watch volunteer, 29, said he fired his gun in self-defence, and a six-member jury acquitted him of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sharpton was speaking after violence erupted on the West Coast during protests over the acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Los Angeles police said about 150 people broke off from a larger, peaceful protest and began walking through the streets, committing multiple acts of vandalism and several assaults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 300 officers were called to the scene but they held back from directly engaging with the protesters in an attempt to allow a peaceful end to the demonstration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirteen people were arrested and officers warned they would adopt a much stricter stance if the protests continued for another night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least one person was injured and police made nine arrests when another protest turned violent in Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspapers reported that a waiter guarding windows at a restaurant was hit in the face with a hammer, and protesters threw fireworks at police in riot gear, while police deployed stun grenades. Police spokeswoman Johnna Watson said the arrests were for crimes including assault with a deadly weapon and vandalism.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Superstition star made his position clear during a gig in Quebec City on July 14, after George Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I decided today that until the Stand Your Ground law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again,&quot; he told the crowd. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 63-year-old added: &quot;The truth is that - for those of you who've lost in the battle for justice, wherever that fits in any part of the world - we can't bring them back. What we can do is we can let our voices be heard. And we can vote in our various countries throughout the world for change and equality for everybody. That's what I know we can do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevie is the latest music star to lend his voice to Martin's case. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, who was unarmed, was gunned down by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman, then 28, last February in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. Martin was returning there after a trip to a nearby convenience store when Zimmerman deemed the teen's activity suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was acquitted of murder charges by a jury on Saturday, a decision that has since caused a rift across the nation and generated a wave of protests, rallies and vigils, some peaceful, some belligerent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 100 residents rallied for the slain teen on Park Square last March, many crying injustice prior to Zimmerman's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clayton said she and her family and friends only want peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been watching [this case] very closely. We have a 17-year-old. The fact that [Martin] was another 17-year-old just walking home from a 7-11 minding his own business and was shot is just wrong,&quot; said Clayton. &quot;A lot of kids these days are singled out as being a punk or in a gang for how they dress, when the fact is a lot of kids aren't looking for trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was upset by Saturday's verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People need to stand up for safety in cities, for parents, for this young boy who got his life taken from him so young,&quot; said Clayton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vigil for Martin, said the Pittsfield mother, is meant to be brief, quiet and peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want any negativity, no yelling or angry signs,&quot; she said. &quot;The outcome, I hope, will be to stop all this negativity and violence, especially that which is aimed toward young adults.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People may begin gathering at 7 p.m. on Park Square in downtown Pittsfield. At 7:17, the approximate time of Martin's shooting, people are asked to light a candle and hold a moment of silence. Clayton said people should bring their own candle, and may wear a gray hooded sweatshirt. That kind of sweatshirt, worn by Martin at the time of his death, has become a symbol of protest and solidarity among Martin sympathizers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the end of this silent protest, people can just disperse on their own. We just want to show the [Martin] family that their son's light will shine on,&quot; Clayton said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI (AP) - Three jurors in George Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial initially favored convicting him of that offense or manslaughter, but the six-woman jury ultimately voted to acquit him after more closely examining the law, a juror in the case said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last year, but the jury also was allowed to consider manslaughter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman known as Juror B37 told CNN's Anderson Cooper that when the jury began deliberations Friday, they took an initial vote. Three jurors- including B37 - were in favor of acquittal, two supported manslaughter and one backed second-degree murder. She said the jury started going through all the evidence, listening to tapes multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why it took us so long,&quot; said B37, who plans to write a book on the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they started looking at the law, the person who initially wanted second-degree murder changed her vote to manslaughter, the juror said. Then they asked for clarification from the judge and went over it again and again. B37 said some jurors wanted to find Zimmerman guilty of something, but there was just no place to go based on the law,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B37 said jurors cried when they gave their final vote to the bailiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want people to know that we put everything into everything to get this verdict,&quot; said the juror, whose face was blacked out during the televised interview but who appeared to become choked up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interview came two days after the jury acquitted Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch activist, of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Martin in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. Martin was black, and Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic. Zimmerman was not arrested for 44 days, and the delay in charging him led to protests from those who believed race was a factor in the handling of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While prosecutors accused Zimmerman of profiling Martin, Zimmerman maintained he acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37, the only juror to speak publicly about the case so far, said Monday that the actions of Zimmerman and Martin both led to the teenager's fatal shooting, but that Zimmerman didn't actually break the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zimmerman made some poor decisions leading up to the shooting, including leaving his car when police told him not to, Martin wasn't innocent either, the juror said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into,&quot; said the juror. &quot;I think they both could have walked away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror said Sanford Police Detective Chris Serino made a big impression on her, because he would have been accustomed to dealing with murders and similar cases. He would have known how to spot a liar, and yet he testified that he believed Zimmerman, the juror said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal analysts agreed that Serino's testimony was a blow to the state's case. The Sanford police were criticized last year for not arresting Zimmerman, and Gov. Rick Scott later appointed a special prosecutor, who brought charges against the neighborhood watch volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror said she didn't think Martin's race was the reason that Zimmerman followed him on a dark, rainy night. She said she also believed Martin threw the first punch and that Zimmerman, whom she referred to as &quot;George,&quot; had a right to defend himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have no doubt George feared for his life in the situation he was in at the time,&quot; the juror said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror was not impressed by the testimony of Rachel Jeantel, who was talking with Martin by cellphone moments before he was fatally shot by Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't think it was very credible, but I felt very sorry for her,&quot; the juror said. &quot;She didn't want to be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror also commented on defense attorney Don West's knock-knock joke about knowing who Zimmerman was during opening statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The joke was horrible. Nobody got it,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 outlined to CNN the process she and the other five jurors went through in their deliberations. She said they spent the first day electing a foreman and getting organized. She said the jury instructions weren't immediately clear and the evidence was in no order whatsoever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said it was a difficult process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thought about it for hours and cried over it afterwards,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't think any of us could ever do anything like that ever again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Literary Management announced Monday that it is representing B37 and her husband, who is an attorney. The names of the jurors have not been released, but during jury selection it was disclosed that B37 works in an unspecified management position and has two adult children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Martin Literary said the book would focus on what it is like to be sequestered and why B37 felt she had no choice but to acquit Zimmerman. The agency said it is approaching several publishers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate interview, Jeantel was asked by CNN's Piers Morgan whether she thought race was a factor in Zimmerman's decision to follow Martin prior to their fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was racial,&quot; she said. &quot;Let's be honest. Racial. If he were white, if Trayvon was white and he had a hoodie on, what would happen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that the altercation happened in the early evening, when many people are out walking their dogs or doing other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morgan played back a recording of the juror's comments to CNN about Jeantel's education level and speech, and the witness said it made her sad and angry. Jeantel, who is black, said she also had a feeling that the jury would return a not-guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're white,&quot; she said of the jury at one point. &quot;Well, one Hispanic. But she's stuck in the middle. I had a feeling it was going to be a 'not guilty.&quot;'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the court did not release the racial makeup of the jury, the panel appeared to reporters covering jury selection to be made up of five white women and a sixth who may be Hispanic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was not at all surprised by the verdict in the heartrending Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case. It was, devastatingly, exactly what I'd expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review, asserted in an op-ed last week that the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case was never about race. Lowry called the trial of George Zimmerman -- the Sanford, Fl., neighborhood watch volunteer who shot Martin -- &quot;the racial metaphor that failed&quot; and &quot;a tale of the left's desperation to indict contemporary America as a land of rank racism.&quot; Although I agree with him that comparing the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin to the lynching of Emmett Till -- for supposedly whistling at a white woman in 1950s Mississippi -- is not an entirely apt comparison, it was astonishing that Lowry dismissed the presence of race and the critical importance of context and complexity. What set the tragic events in motion was Zimmerman's belief that Martin -- a black teen -- had no legitimate reason to be in his gated community; his youth, his dress, his class and the color of his skin were all signals to Zimmerman that Martin was someone to fear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial hung on the jury's interpretation of the struggle that precipitated Martin's death. Who was on top? Who was the aggressor? Whose voice is heard screaming for help on the 911 tape? Race, central to the national discussion since Martin's death, was relegated to the sidelines in the courtroom. As New York Times reporter Lizette Alvarez asserts, &quot;the judge made it clear that statements about race would be sharply limited and the term 'racial profiling' not allowed.&quot; This is partly due to Florida's overly generous self-defense laws, which protected Zimmerman even though he precipitated the conflict by tailing the innocent Martin. But racial issues should not be ignored. Zimmerman's four other calls to the police to describe suspicious people in his neighborhood all reported black people. His fear and distrust were certainly shaped within the context of race and class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Times columnist Charles Blow wonders whether we are &quot;acculturated to grant some citizens the right to feel fear while systematically denying that right to others.&quot; Zimmerman's attorney pounced on prosecution witness Rachel Jeantel when she recounted that Martin told her he was scared because he was being followed by a &quot;creepy-ass cracker.&quot; The defense lawyer suggested that Martin was racial profiling, not Zimmerman. An unarmed, young, black male -- being followed at night by a stranger -- it seems, is not entitled to feel genuine (and it turns out, justified) fear for his life. Even if Martin was the one who initiated the physical altercation, it is certainly true that the two need never have been in close contact. Blow reminds us that &quot;if Zimmerman had stayed in his vehicle and not pursued the teenager, Martin would have made it home for the second half of the NBA All-Star Game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 2007 Justice Department study reveals that although African Americans make up just 13 percent of the American population, they are the victims of almost half of all murders in the U.S.; 3 out of 4 of these murders are committed with guns. Dan Eggan of the Washington Post asserts that &quot;encounters with criminals are often more likely to turn deadly for black victims than for victims of other races, in part because black victims are more likely confronted with firearms.&quot; Blacks in poor or urban areas were more likely to be victimized than those in affluent areas. Yet, Zimmerman was culturally entitled to his fear but Martin was not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the late '90s, I taught English in El Salvador for a summer. On a day trip to an outlying village, I went walking on a trail on the outskirts of town with an American and a Salvadoran friend. We each tucked a few colones in our pockets in case we needed to hand over some cash quickly to any thugs. We were prepared for muggings, but our Salvadoran friend assured us that we'd be safe with her -- especially in broad daylight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we strolled along chatting, a young man suddenly emerged from behind a tree, brandishing a pistol and said, &quot;Disculpa.&quot; (I'd been mugged before in Manhattan, and I can assure you no one ever said, &quot;Excuse me.&quot;) It was an odd moment; it took us several beats to realize he was accompanied by two men with machetes. They waved the machetes threateningly and, although my fear prevented me from quickly translating the Spanish they shouted at us, there was no mistaking their meaning. They grabbed our goods and slipped back into the woods while we ran for our lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterwards, as we tried to calm our nerves and drive out all the awful images of what could have happened, my American friend and I assessed our losses: some money, our watches, and our feelings of invincibility. But our Salvadoran friend had, by far, lost the most. Her work briefcase was gone; it contained just about every cherished monetary possession, along with keys to her office and home. She was devastated -- truly scared for her safety. Deconstructing the events, we all agreed that our race and our social class had certainly put our Salvadoran friend at much greater risk than if she'd been walking with other Salvadoran friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By failing to fully consider the complexities of race, class and gender or the thorny cultural backdrop before heading out on our walk, we had unwittingly made her a target. We should have thought about these things; we were living in a foreign country. Not so for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. He assumed he'd be safe in his father's own neighborhood.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media pundits, columnists and anyone with a keyboard and link to the Internet Saturday night was ready to share their thoughts on the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin/George Zimmerman case. While everyone is entitled to their opinions, we think it's a shame that the conversation immediately turned (once again) to race relations in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact of the matter is that, even though police were first hesitant to arrest Zimmerman in the shooting death of Martin, he was eventually arrested, charged and sent to trial. During that trial, a jury was selected by both the prosecution and defense teams. That jury listened to testimony for weeks, eventually deliberating for more than 16 hours before finding Zimmerman not guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like it or not, that is our justice system at work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's impossible to know whether it was Trayvon&nbsp;Martin or George Zimmerman who threw the first punch in the confrontation that ended Martin's life,&quot; Ryan Grim wrote in a Huffington Post report on Monday. &quot;The jury apparently relied on that ambiguity to acquit Zimmerman on murdering Martin, because he said he killed the 17-year-old in self defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those who are unaware of the details of the case, they are as follows: Zimmerman, an aspiring police officer, was on patrol as part of a neighborhood watch, when he discovered Martin walking through a gated community in Sanford, Fla. He called 911 and began to follow the 17-year-old. At some point, a confrontation ensued, in which Martin was subsequently shot and killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the trial, less than savory accusations were made about the characters of both individuals. And you know what they say about hindsight? As it turns out, Martin, being followed by a stranger, felt just as threatened as Zimmerman claimed he was. And, as the Huffington Post points out, this whole ordeal could have been avoided if any of the following decisions had been made that night:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman could have decided not to follow Martin. Or, he could have heeded the advice of a 911 operator, who instructed Zimmerman to discontinue the pursuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Zimmerman had not been secretly armed, he probably wouldn't have followed Martin. ... If Zimmerman's weapon had not been hidden, Martin probably would have dealt with him differently.&quot; Makes sense. Zimmerman wouldn't have had the gun to fall back on in a &quot;worst case scenario,&quot; and Martin, if he knew there was a possibility he could have been shot and killed, may have adjusted his demeanor appropriately, as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, given his history (which includes domestic assault), Zimmerman could have been barred from carrying a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, lastly and perhaps most obvious, Zimmerman could have simply chose to not shoot and kill Martin. Despite who attacked whom, it was Zimmerman's &quot;series of aggressive decisions,&quot; as the Huffington Post puts it, which led to the fight. Imagine where each would be today if, instead of going for his gun, Zimmerman chose to re-think his strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, the editorial board doesn't believe this needs to be relegated to nothing more than a race issue, despite what many on both side of the argument say. Instead, this case shows the various, deeply troubling loopholes and problems with the stand your ground laws on the books in Florida and several other states around the country. Just as the Sandy Hook shooting last December, this case should force our elected lawmakers to take a closer look at and begin to revise the many lax gun laws in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis,&quot; President Obama said following the verdict this weekend. &quot;We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this. As citizens, that's a job for all of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's hope this case doesn't become a forgotten memory before action could have prevented a similar tragedy down the road.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moment neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old white Latino, shot black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin dead in February 2012 as he walked innocently to his father's home in Sanford, Fla., race and politics took centre stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing reverberated throughout the nation's black communities, whose members know only too well the harsh reality of racial profiling and that the justice system is rife with racial bias, as many studies have shown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these two ingredients were mixed into the judicial process, two other elements in the case retreated into the shadows. Those ingredients, however, would prove pivotal: gun control and Florida's so-called &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, plus its related statutes on self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essentially, Zimmerman was able to shoot Martin because Florida law - and the law in most states - permits him to carry a concealed weapon and gave him the right to use that weapon to defend himself against grave bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem, however, is people can get it wrong. They can misinterpret the danger. Luckily for these shooters, the law also protects against that eventuality. &quot;The chaos of such defensive-force situations means that people commonly make mistakes,&quot; Paul Robinson, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, recently wrote in The Wall Street Journal. &quot;The law does not require that a person get it exactly right. It may be enough that the person honestly believed his force was necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman said he followed Martin because he thought he was a robber. When an angry Martin turned on him and began beating him up, Zimmerman shot him in self-defence. That's his story. When police declared the shooting was indeed self-defence, civil rights activists organized mass protests. The dark hoodie Martin wore that fateful night became a civil rights emblem. Federal and state politicians met with prosecutors and urged Zimmerman's arrest and prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing was hashed out in America's newsrooms. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and MSNBC host, travelled to Florida where he led protest marches. CNN and MSNBC claimed the tape of a 911 call made by Zimmerman &quot;clearly&quot; recorded him calling Martin a &quot;coon.&quot; CNN later retracted its statement, admitting that the tape did not contain any racial slur but rather the word &quot;cold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even U.S. President Barack Obama joined the fray. He announced to the nation, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Justice Department sent FBI investigators to gather evidence for possible prosecution of Zimmerman for federal civil rights violations. No case was filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was finally charged about two months after the shooting with second-degree murder. (The prosecutor would, at the end of the trial, add the charge of manslaughter as a fallback in case the jury didn't accept the harsher allegation.) The trial did not go well for the prosecution. A witness said he saw a person in dark clothing (Martin wore a dark hoodie) holding a man to the ground and beating him, which confirmed Zimmerman's story. A policeman testified that he believed Zimmerman's account that he shot Trayvon in self-defence. Photos of Zimmerman taken immediately after the killing showed him with a broken nose and wounds on the back of his head where he claimed Trayvon had slammed his head against the concrete sidewalk. (There was evidence the prosecution tried to suppress these photos.) There was no evidence at trial that Zimmerman had voiced racial slurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a jury of six women - five white and one Hispanic - found him not guilty of either charge, protests swept across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Jacqueline Lewis of New York's Middle Collegiate Church reportedly wore a pink hoodie when she took to the pulpit, encouraging parishioners to &quot;raise our voices against the root causes of this kind of tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerned about possible violence, akin to the riots that inflamed the streets of Los Angeles following the acquittal of the policemen who beat Rodney King in 1991, Obama issued a statement, saying: &quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis,&quot; he later added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP produced a petition with 450,000 names urging the justice department to reopen a civil rights investigation against Zimmerman, claiming he killed Trayvon because he was black. The Justice Department agreed to reopen the file.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Zimmerman has the right to get his gun back.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 16--On a personal note, I find myself trying to separate the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Story from the Zimmerman Trial -- unlike many of my liberal counterparts -- maybe to ease personal discontentment with &quot;The System&quot; for allowing itself to be used to prop-up a self-defence claim over the obvious truth of racial profiling that led to the death of a unarmed, African-American youth; who had no intention of committing a crime the night he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, I have to submit to the rule of law, whether it's fair or not, and it was on the basis of Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; (SYG) law that the jurors deliberated on -- was George Zimmerman's life 'sufficiently' in danger for him to have shot and killed Trayvon? And with my own eyes I watched the defence team resuscitate Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in that court room with the intention of painting him as &quot;black&quot;, using racial stereotypes to convince the jurors and the public that Zimmerman was right in &quot;pursuing&quot;, &quot;engaging&quot; and &quot;killing&quot; the &quot;black&quot; in a hoodie because his &quot;profile&quot; was indicative of a troublemaker of some kind.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who Failed Trayvon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unfortunately, the prosecution was simply afraid to touch on race; rather they focused squarely on storytelling with the evidence and purely based on that I gave Zimmerman a gut wrenching &quot;not-guilty&quot; long before the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was no hard task for Zimmerman's attorneys to destabilize the sturdy ground on which the prosecution felt they stood with their case of killing without justification. The needless death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was placed second to the ineffective refuting Zimmerman's self-defence story -- the prosecution faulted when they refused to highlight the thinking of Zimmerman when he had called the police, in his capacity as a neighbourhood watchman complained of suspicious persons, who were all &quot;black&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the trial, the star witness for the prosecution was a female friend of Trayvon, who was the last person to speak to Trayvon except Zimmerman -- and the defence turned her into a representative for all &quot;blacks&quot; across America because of her heavy Creole -- even asking, &quot;Do you have a problem understanding English?&quot;, although it was obvious she didn't. When the defence brought out the witness who had her house broken into by a &quot;black&quot; teenager to prove somehow that all African-American youth are &quot;burglars&quot; (no offence, of course), how did the prosecution miss the opportunity to expose such blatant profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Failed Trayvon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is that profiling that caused Zimmerman to leave his truck to further pursue Trayvon (despite being told not to by a 911 dispatcher) with a loaded gun, with the &quot;SYG&quot; law on his side Mr Zimmerman would have been emboldened to take the confrontation as far as he wanted it to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without a doubt the highest tier of &quot;The System&quot; failed an unarmed teenager. The law created and supported by a fully conservative state legislature that gave so much power to George Zimmerman wasn't able to stop Dr Marissa Alexander from getting sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot into the roof of her home to stop the violent advances of her ex-husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also that same law that made the Stanford police treat dead Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as a suspect and living Zimmerman free for days after the incident and as it was proven that &quot;Justice delayed is justice denied&quot;. The Justice Department said on Sunday it will weigh criminal civil rights charges against Zimmerman, as urged by the NAACP and others. That course would be satisfying on one level, presumably addressing the actions that led to the fight, probably rendering the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law ineffective -- because the confrontation was unnecessary and triggered by profiling. Just as the federal government has done repeatedly in history it must do again in defending the civil rights and dignity of the minority -- race, gender, sexuality, religion, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going Forward</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Salvation for a race, nation or class must come from within. Freedom is never granted, it is won. Justice is never given; it is exacted.&quot; -- A. Phillip Randolph</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time freedom will be won not in court or through the legislature but through the actions of a people angered and saddened by death and the perceived injustice following that death; we must not falter in our commitment to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Dr King, Marcus Garvey, Nelson Mandela, Bob Marley, Rosa Parks or any other who spoke, stood, sat or died in our place so that we could have salvation in knowing that we are all equal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To invoke violence, would corrupt the advances we have made through peaceful protest and processes, like the election of the first African-American President Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now is not the time to be Zimmerman's &quot;black&quot; but &quot;I am black and I am proud&quot; kind of &quot;black&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Aug. 24, thousands will gather to mark the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, which culminated on the National Mall with the Rev. Martin Luther King's &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The Lower Sussex NAACP is sponsoring a bus to the march. If you are interested in going on the trip, send your name and email address to lowersussexnaacp@yahoo.com)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The march can't help being bittersweet. How extraordinary that on the 50th anniversary of King's speech we have a black man as president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How sad that, despite progress, our country remains as divided as ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent divisive issue, of course, is George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people are calling on the federal government to press civil charges against Zimmerman. Defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz is calling for a federal investigation of the case's prosecutor, Angela Corey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's saying that if anyone's civil rights were violated, it was Zimmerman's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first blush, it sounds outlandish that the man who shot and killed a teenager and then was acquitted of all charges is the victim of civil rights violations. But Dershowitz has a point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor, he said, with: held photographs of a bleeding Zimmerman that would have served as exculpatory evidence on a second-degree murder charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Personally, I think the second-degree murder charge was a stretch; manslaughter would have been fairer, though not necessarily more likely to have resulted in a conviction.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the problem. Florida's Stand Your Ground law is on Zimmerman's side, and the law needs to be changed. Unfortunately, I fear the opposite, that Zimmerman's acquittal will be seen as a vindication of a terrible law that effectively gives people like Zimmerman a license to kill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's hope Delaware doesn't go down that road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think about it. Zimmerman initiated a confrontation. He had no reason to do so. Neither he nor his property was in any danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor was Martin doing anything wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was walking through the neighborhood, suspicious only because of his youth and, yes, likely his race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was even warned by a police dispatcher not to confront Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He chose to do so, probably because the gun gave him the courage. The confrontation escalated into an altercation - not exactly a surprise - and when Zimmerman found himself on the losing end of the fight, he pulled his gun and killed Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A completely and wholly preventable tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman has a right to own a gun. He has a right to use that gun to protect his home and family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, naturally, he has a right to walk around his neighborhood and alert police about people he thinks might be criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is with Zimmerman - and civilians in general - carrying a gun while on a Neighborhood Watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that point, with Stand Your Ground laws, you effectively have amateur, untrained police officers unbound by any rules about using deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And often they're not even held accountable. Zimmerman was only arrested 44 days later, because of public pressure. In the beginning, there wasn't even much of an investigation. Zimmerman said he felt threatened, so he fired his weapon. That was almost the end of the story. In light of Zimmerman's acquittal, it's hard to imagine Florida police even trying to bring charges in similar cases, unless the law is changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compare that to what happens when a police officer fires his weapon, at least in Delaware. Even in the most seemingly open-and-shut case there is an investigation, usually lengthy. The public often expresses great concern about police officers' use of deadly force, even outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's how it should be, because the consequences are so severe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would Zimmerman have been arrested if the shooting had occurred in Delaware? Probably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Delaware, people have a right to defend themselves with deadly force, but there are limitations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Delaware Criminal Code, a person is not justified answering with deadly force if he is the one &quot;who provoked the use of force against the defendant in the same encounter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, under Delaware law, a person is not justified if he &quot;knows that the necessity of using deadly force can be avoided with complete safety by retreating&quot; or by &quot;surrendering possession of a thing&quot; to another person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think Zimmerman would have failed both those tests. Whether he intended to or not, he provoked the fight. And he could have retreated before trouble started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delaware follows what is sometimes called the Castle Doctrine, that a man's home is his castle and he (or she) has a right to defend it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People are not required &quot;to retreat in or from&quot; their dwelling or place of work before using deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delaware law allows people to protect themselves, but not to play police officer. That's how it should be.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI (AP) - As they began deliberating in George Zimmerman's murder trial, three of the six jurors wanted to acquit him while the other three wanted to convict him of either murder or manslaughter, one of the jurors said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-woman jury ultimately voted to acquit Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder in last year's shooting but the jury also was allowed to consider manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman, known as Juror B37, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday that when the jury began deliberations Friday, they took an initial vote. Three jurors- including B37 - were in favor of acquittal, two supported manslaughter and one backed second-degree murder. She said the jury started going through all the evidence, listening to tapes multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why it took us so long,&quot; said B37, who said she planned to write a book about the trial but later had a change of heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they started looking at the law, the person who initially wanted second-degree murder changed her vote to manslaughter, the juror said. Then they asked for clarification from the judge and went over it again and again. B37 said some jurors wanted to find Zimmerman guilty of something, but there was just no place to go based on the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B37 said jurors cried when they gave their final vote to the bailiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want people to know that we put everything into everything to get this verdict,&quot; said the juror, whose face was blacked out during the televised interview but who appeared to become choked up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interview came two days after the jury acquitted Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch volunteer, of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Martin in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. Martin was black, and Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic. Zimmerman was not arrested for 44 days, and the delay in charging him led to protests from those who believed race was a factor in the handling of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While prosecutors accused Zimmerman of profiling Martin, Zimmerman maintained he acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37, the only juror to speak publicly about the case so far, said Monday that the actions of Zimmerman and Martin both led to the teenager's fatal shooting, but that Zimmerman didn't actually break the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zimmerman made some poor decisions leading up to the shooting, including leaving his car when police told him not to, Martin wasn't innocent either, the juror said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into,&quot; said the juror. &quot;I think they both could have walked away.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE jury's verdict in the sad Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case seems to say it's OK for a Rambo-style white vigilante to arm himself with a pistol, follow an unarmed black teenager in the dark, get into a confrontation, shoot the teen to death and pay no penalty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the teen in this affair had been white, we doubt that George Zimmerman would have trailed him or shot him. We presume that Zimmerman, a self-appointed neighborhood amateur cop, told a police dispatcher that Martin was an &quot;(expletive) punk&quot; who &quot;looks like he's up to no good&quot; just because the boy was black. Even though the dispatcher told Zimmerman to desist, he continued stalking the youth until tragedy resulted. The exchange went like this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dispatcher: Are you following him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: Yeah</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dispatcher: OK, we don't need you to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that Zimmerman has been declared innocent, we hope it doesn't inspire gun-lovers everywhere to prowl with weapons at night, looking for other &quot;suspicious&quot; targets - and shooting some of them under the brutal &quot;stand your ground&quot; principle. That's a grotesque prospect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To deter this problem and obtain some degree of justice for Martin's family, we hope a wrongful death civil lawsuit is pursued against Zimmerman. Also, we hope the U.S. Justice Department explores the possibility of filing civil rights charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama correctly called Martin's killing a &quot;tragedy, not just for his family, or any one community, but for America.&quot; He added: &quot;We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USA Today called the Florida nightmare &quot;a tragically familiar tale of snap judgments by strangers, racial profiling and a black teenager's needless death. ... The fact remains that Martin was doing nothing wrong; he was returning from a snack run at a convenience store, heading for the house of his father's girlfriend. And the fact remains that had Zimmerman stayed in his truck, as advised by the police, Martin would be alive today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Los Angeles Times column said the case &quot;must send a chill down the spine of every parent of a black teenager in this country,&quot; because it shows that a white man with an automatic pistol can follow an unarmed black youth and wind up killing him - and be given his gun back with no consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Smith, Democratic leader in Florida's state Senate, lamented:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that a child is dead and an armed man can now walk free without so much as a backward glance sends the wrong message to Florida and its citizens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We agree with USA Today's conclusion:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite all the nation's progress in burying its racist past, minorities are commonly stopped by authorities - or viewed by strangers as 'up to no good' - for no other reason than the color of their skin.... Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death remains an avoidable American tragedy - one that Zimmerman set in motion.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALABAMA (CIHAN)- A jurors from the trial of Florida neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman for the death of unarmed black teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin said the six-woman panel was sharply divided when deliberations began. <BR><BR>The jurors ultimately came to a unanimous decision, finding Zimmerman not guilty on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the case that has brought tough questions about racism in the United States back to the fore.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in an interview on CNN, juror B-37 -- who was not named and was shown in deep shadow -- said the first vote was split down the middle between those who wanted an acquittal and those who wanted to convict. <BR><BR>&quot;We had three not guilties, one second degree murder and two manslaughters,&quot; the juror said, adding she was one of the ones who voted not guilty. <BR><BR>Zimmerman -- who has a white father and a Peruvian mother -- said he acted in self-defense when he shot Martin during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, 2012. <BR><BR>But prosecutors said he profiled and stalked Martin, provoking the altercation that led to Martin's death. <BR><BR>The juror said ultimately it became a question of whether the events leading up the shooting were legally relevant or if, for self-defense, it is the moment before pulling the trigger that counts. <BR><BR>&quot;It was just so confusing with what and what we could apply to what. Because I mean, there was a couple of them in there that wanted to find him guilty of something,&quot; the juror said. <BR><BR>But &quot;after hours and hours and hours of deliberating over the law and reading it over and over and over again, we decided there's just no way.&quot; <BR><BR>The juror explained her understanding of what happened that night: &quot;I think George got in a little bit too deep.... He shouldn't have been there. But Trayvon decided that he wasn't going to let him scare him and get the one up on him or something. And I think Trayvon got mad and attacked him,&quot; the juror said. <BR><BR>&quot;I had no doubt George feared for his life in the situation he was in at the time.&quot; <BR><BR>But she broke into tears as she described the mental anguish she and the other jurors felt as they weighed their decision. <BR><BR>&quot;It's a tragedy this happened, but it happened. And I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves in to. I think both of them could have walked away.&quot; <BR><BR>In the aftermath of the verdict, race again came to the fore, with angry protesters asking if the result would have been the same had Martin been white and Zimmerman black. &quot;We are all Trayvon,&quot; some cried. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the juror said the panel of five white and one Hispanic women didn't discuss race and she did not believe it was a factor in the shooting. <BR><BR>Judge Debra Nelson ruled at the outset that prosecutors could not say that Zimmerman had profiled Martin on the basis of race, and the topic was rarely discussed in the trial. <BR><BR>SHOT LIST <BR><BR>PORTLAND, OREGON, JULY 15, 2013, SOURCE: CBS <BR><BR>RESTRICTIONS: <BR><BR>*NO RESALE for non-editorial purposes* <BR><BR>No Japan <BR>No Free over-the-air broadcasters in Australia  <BR>No US cable news outlets, free over-the-air networks or stations, their websites and their mobile phone services <BR><BR>VAR of people gathering together, holding signs, protesting <BR><BR>BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, JULY 15 2013, SOURCE: CBS <BR><BR>RESTRICTIONS: <BR><BR>*NO RESALE for non-editorial purposes* <BR><BR>No Japan <BR>No Free over-the-air broadcasters in Australia  <BR>No US cable news outlets, free over-the-air networks or stations, their websites and their mobile phone services <BR><BR>MS of policemen talking <BR>A sign reading 'Justice' <BR>People walking <BR>Children holding signs reading 'Justice For Trayvon' <BR>People walking, a man chanting 'No justice, no peace' <BR><BR>SOUNDBITE 1 Chanell Allen (woman), demonstrator (English, 15 sec): <BR>&quot;Basically black people are being profiled for no reason.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 16--Pottsville lawyer Frederick J. Fanelli said Monday the George Zimmerman case revived memories of one that started five years ago Friday in Shenandoah -- the killing of Luis Eduardo Ramirez Zavala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems to be nearly an identical fact pattern,&quot; Fanelli said of the cases. &quot;You had a fight in the street. Because of the race issues involved, it generated a lot of intensity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fanelli represented Brandon J. Piekarsky of Shenandoah Heights, one of three young men charged in connection with the death of Ramirez, 25, of Shenandoah, as the result of a fight on July 12, 2008, on West Lloyd Street. Ramirez died at Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, two days after the fight. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of Zimmerman, it is the Hispanic man who faced criminal accusations as the result of a race-tinged incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A six-woman jury on Saturday acquitted Zimmerman, 29, of Sanford, Fla., of all charges in connection with the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, 17, on Feb. 26, 2012, during a fight between the two. Zimmerman had been facing a possible prison sentence of 25 years to life if convicted of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Ramirez case, a Schuylkill County jury convicted Piekarsky and Derrick M. Donchak, of Shenandoah, on May 1, 2009, of simple assault and alcohol-related offenses, while acquitting each of more serious crimes, including third-degree murder in Piekarsky's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, on Oct. 14, 2010, a jury in U.S. District Court in Scranton convicted both men of violating Ramirez's civil rights. Senior U.S. District Judge A. Richard Caputo, who presided over the men's trial, sentenced each to serve nine years in a federal correctional institution. Donchak, now 23, is serving his sentence at FCI Otisville in New York, while Piekarsky, now 21, is serving his sentence at FCI Beckley in West Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ramirez case drew national attention due to issues of racism and illegal immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shenandoah Borough Manager Joseph L. Palubinsky said Monday that the community is moving forward, but otherwise declined to talk about the Ramirez case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donchak's lawyer in the county case, Jeffrey M. Markosky, also said the Zimmerman case reminded him of the Ramirez case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the same racial overtones are present in that case as they were&quot; in the Ramirez one, he said of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fanelli said he believes Zimmerman, like Donchak and Piekarsky, is not through with the legal system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd be surprised if (federal prosecutors) didn't attempt to pursue a civil rights claim against him,&quot; Fanelli said of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the dual sovereignty doctrine, which holds that the state and federal governments are independent and allows each of them to prosecute criminal cases, separate prosecutions of a defendants in state and federal courts do not violate the Fifth Amendment's ban on double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has confirmed that the Department of Justice is investigating Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markosky said federal authorities never should have prosecuted Donchak and Piekarsky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought the verdict in the county court was appropriate,&quot; he said. &quot;They should have served the sentences from (President) Judge (William E.) Baldwin in county court and that should have been the end of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 17, 2009, Baldwin sentenced Donchak to seven to 23 months in prison and Piekarsky to six months and one week to 23 months in prison. Baldwin declined to be interviewed about any comparisons between the Zimmerman and Ramirez cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fanelli, who agreed with Markosky that the county sentences were sufficient in the Ramirez case, also said Zimmerman had the benefit of two superb lawyers, Mark O'Mara and Donald West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought his lawyers were top-notch and terrific,&quot; Fanelli said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- Already reeling from two nights of vandalism and violence, Oakland was mopping up Tuesday morning after a third night of protests downtown that left more smashed windows and storefronts, graffiti and scattered debris from demonstrators' clashes with police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd of several hundred were protesting Saturday's acquittal of George Zimmerman in Florida and briefly shut down traffic on Interstate 880 and blocked several streets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the protesters' marches and skirmishes with police downtown, more than a dozen businesses were vandalized, including some targeted during previous protests. City cleanup crews started at 6 a.m. &quot;to get a head start&quot; on the garbage and other debris, one worker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those targeted for the first time were Comerica Bank, 1200 Broadway, the Burger King restaurant at 13th and Broadway, Youth Radio, 1701 Broadway, and Men's Wearhouse, 300 Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. All had windows smashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those vandalized previously that were damaged again Monday night and early Tuesday included Sears Roebuck and Co., 1950 Broadway, which had additional windows smashed and paint splattered, and the restaurant Flora, 1900 Telegraph Ave., where a waiter was savagely attacked and windows were broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already boarded-up windows on some businesses became easels for graffiti, including the Oakland Tribune offices at 1900 Broadway, T-Mobile at 13th and Broadway, Foot Locker in the 1400 block of Broadway and the California Bank and Trust at 19th and Franklin streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business owners and others were concerned over the damage and were worried about when it would end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Golshami, manager of El Senor Burrito 3 at 430 13th St., said he was glad that no damage was done to his business, which had boarded up its windows in advance. He said he plans to keep them boarded up &quot;for the next few days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A security guard working his first day at the MASH building, 428 13th St., said he had not been told how long he would be there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ratha Kuch, 41, owner of the Buongiorno restaurant on Broadway, which just recently opened, felt fortunate that none of his windows were broken and had no plans to board them up. &quot;I'm frustrated and I hope this ends soon,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the night's protests, a restaurant worker at Flora in Oakland's Uptown area was injured when he was hit by a masked, hammer-wielding attacker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another injury was reported by witnesses who said a protester was injured and writhing in pain at Broadway and 16th Street after apparently being struck in the shoulder by a police projectile. Police are still investigating whether anyone was hit by an object, whether it came from police or from the crowd. Police have not been able to locate the person who was injured. At one point, a squad of officers making arrests of vandalism suspects was surrounded by protesters throwing rocks and bottles and they responded by firing one tear-gas round, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nine arrests made by police Tuesday night included suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, resisting arrest, vandalism and similar offenses. One replica firearm (BB gun) was recovered from a protester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland developer Phil Tagami said he watched vandals deface one of his own buildings last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oakland is a very progressive town and we're very understanding of different points of view and we'll continue to defend people's rights to peacefully assemble and protest. That's part of the DNA of Oakland,&quot; he said. &quot;What we don't appreciate is the lawlessness and the anarchy and the physical violence as well as the property damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw the crowd out there last night. When people are smashing out the windows of Youth Radio that's clearly someone who isn't from Oakland or even about what the issue is. They're anarchists. These are local businesses with local owners with local employees. These are not chained businesses. I don't get it. That's the disconnect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tagami, who in 2011 provided a one-man sentry for the Rotunda Building in Frank H. Ogawa Plaza that he oversaw a $50 million renovation on in years past, called for a zero-tolerance policy regarding the vandalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're doing that you're going to jail. If you're hitting someone with a hammer you're going to jail,&quot; he said. &quot;That person has to be found and held to account.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why not protest the murders here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As shocking as George Zimmerman's acquittal may seem to most of us, let's keep in mind that there are so many murder victims whose killers slip through the cracks of the justice system or are simply never brought to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find it more shocking that Oakland residents would protest Zimmerman's acquittal when the city of Oakland itself has had more than 50 homicides in just this year alone and includes a former student of mine, Aya Nakano, who was murdered in a senseless manner last month and whose killers have yet to be found. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that the national media has an odd way of selecting stories to cover and Oakland residents will wreak havoc on their own city based on anything they feel has racial implications even if it happened 3,000 miles away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think about murder victims in your own city and let's be more sensible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thugs come out again in Oakland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find it extremely disconcerting that when racially charged events occur, either locally or nationally, that thugs come out in Oakland and show blatant disregard for property and the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday evening's events in downtown Oakland were reminiscent of those several years ago after the Oscar Grant verdict and the civil disobedience that ensued. Do these perpetrators understand that they are damaging the property of innocent people and their actions serve no good purpose?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What may be worse in the midst of all this destruction is that the Oakland police made no arrests. It is almost as if the police condoned the actions of an angry mob. The mayor and other city officials need to enforce the rule of law and encourage peaceful protests or Oakland will always have a negative national reputation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who are the white radicals in masks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My impression was that conscious human beings, whether black or white, reacted naturally to the George Zimmerman verdict Saturday with shock and numbness, and by Sunday we experienced a personal meditative reverence inspired by and honoring the behavior of the noble and nonviolent Trayvon&nbsp;Martin family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A loud outcry is understandable, and yet must be a feeble echo of what speaks most loudly, on a worldwide scale -- the unjust murder of Martin calling attention to the unjust fate of so many thousands more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so who are these white radicals in masks, with no love for our town, and no knowledge of our urgent causes or feelings, who come to use Oakland as an experimental laboratory where they may act out their adolescent ignorance, undoubtedly in loud denial of their own unexamined participation in American violence?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was the one who was on trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The George Zimmerman &quot;trial&quot; was a complete sham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was never really on trial: Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hayward</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verdict in the Martin case was shameful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case is a disgrace. There have been times I've been really proud of our country, such as the recent Supreme Court decisions on the Defense of Marriage Act and Proposition 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this made me feel that we have not made an inch of progress on racial equality, and I am profoundly sad to live in a country where such things are possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is it like to be a black parent in Florida (or anywhere there is a stand-your-ground law), to know that anyone can shoot and kill your child with no consequences?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am particularly shocked that the judge instructed the jury to ignore race and its implications in the events leading to the killing of Martin. What could be more relevant to George Zimmerman's motives?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My heart aches for the Martin family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can right this wrong.Moveon.org is circulating a petition calling on the Justice Department to file hate crime charges against George Zimmerman. I urge others to sign as a first step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope Oaklanders will have a discussion about this case, and racial profiling in general. Living in a diverse community is not easy. One of the most difficult issues is how we live peacefully even with our prejudices and racial paranoia, which all of us have.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some $71,000 a year to be a &quot;station agent&quot; who does not sell tickets and does not handle any money? How much training do you need for this? Why do you deserve more money?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am an angry BART rider. I'm sure I am not that much different from many other riders. I have not had a raise in more than 10 years. I do not have a pension. I pay my own medical. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have a college degree and make less than a train operator or a station agent -- and I am grateful to have a job. BART employees do not deserve a 15 or 20 percent pay increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BART unions' demands are absurd. It is inexcusable to hold the public hostage to unreasonable demands. This is a great example of a public employees union out of reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART should be hiring and training replacement workers as quickly as possible and lawmakers should be supporting the public they supposedly serve, not the deep-pocket labor union campaign contributors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;recycling&quot; process -- imposed on maybe one one-thousandth of trashed plastic (think plastic wrappers on plastic containers, most products on store shelves) -- does not recycle into earth. A tree can never eat it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plastic recycling is putting that small percent of plastic into machinery that grinds it, adding unregulated chemicals -- regulation reduces profit -- to make it malleable, then constructing it into couches, textiles, shoes, and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plastic lasts longer than nuclear waste. It will bury us. Please understand we are lied to by our &quot;owners&quot; so they can make profit off us. We're constantly in the position of finding how best to accommodate the lives we're forced to lead, constrained by &quot;their&quot; profit, instead of enrichment of our lives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another matter of great concern is that our elected officials (governor, attorney general, etc.) showed great disdain for the voters over that proposition.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers was performing at the Hayward Russell City Blues Festival downtown when around 5:15 p.m. he dedicated Curtis Mayfield's hit &quot;People Get Ready&quot; to Martin, the 17-year-old shot and killed by George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman on all charges Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers told the audience if Mayfield were around today, he'd change the lyrics &quot;there's a train a comin'&quot; to &quot;there's a change a comin,'&quot; his wife Lola Chambers told this newspaper Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She must have been an acrobat. She did it in one leap. He didn't see her coming,&quot; Lola Chambers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyewitnesses and Hayward police said people on stage subdued Andrews Potter after she allegedly shoved Chambers. Though the police investigation into a motive continues, family members believe the attack was racially motivated and was a result of Chambers' mention of Martin. The family is pressing police to file hate crime charges. Andrews Potter is white, they said. Chambers is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hayward police took Andrews Potter to the police station, where she was arrested on suspicion of battery. She was cited and released, and could face additional charges in the coming days, according to Hayward police Lt. Ruben Pola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers, a Petaluma resident, was taken to the hospital but has since been released, and is using a cane to walk. A photo his son posted on Facebook shows a large welt on his backside. His son said Chambers had a &quot;bruised rib muscle and nerve damage and he is sore all over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers was a member of the 1960s soul group Chambers Brothers and has had a well-publicized fight with record executives over decades of royalty payments he said he has never received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chambers Brothers will be part of the inaugural class inducted into the R&amp;B Hall of Fame later this year, Lola Chambers said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wayne Gulledge didn't join a protest or vigil this week. But like so many African-American men, Gulledge views the acquittal of a Florida neighborhood watch volunteer for killing an unarmed black teenager through the prism of injustices experienced in his own life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is left with this unsettling thought: Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At one point, every black male -- whether you're from the hood, whether you're from the middle class -- has been profiled,&quot; said Gulledge, 33, of San Leandro. &quot;It's just the way it is. It's sad, but you have to expect it, no matter what you do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of George Zimmerman continues to reverberate around the country, and nowhere has the conversation and outrage been louder than in the Bay Area. Nearly 3,000 miles away from the trial in Sanford, Fla., the symbolism of the case has far overshadowed the courtroom proceedings that resulted in a not-guilty verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reaction is not just playing out in the streets of downtown Oakland, where peaceful daylight protests have descended into nighttime chaos and vandalism. Across the region, people continue to wrestle with the stark reality that a 17-year-old African-American who was walking home from a store is dead, and they see no one being held accountable for his lost life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are just so very hurt,&quot; said Pastor Oscar Dace, whose Bible Way Christian Center held a town hall Tuesday night so San Jose congregation members could vent. &quot;It feels like in our country, where there is supposed to be justice for all, there's really only justice for some. This is just another example of a black life not being valued like a white life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For youths angered by the verdicts, several Oakland community centers, art studios and churches have opened their doors. On the Cal State East Bay campus in Hayward, the school's diversity center has a forum planned for Thursday so students and faculty can sort through their feelings about a trial that has provoked such disparate perspectives, many of them falling on racial, generational or ideological lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is one of those stories like the O.J. Simpson trial, where everybody was paying attention,&quot; said Jonathan Stoll, the diversity center manager. &quot;Maybe people were surprised at the verdict, but when they began to look at the larger picture, they realized that it fits a pattern that leaves us with a feeling of hopelessness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, a Florida jury found Zimmerman, 29, not guilty on murder charges in the Feb. 26, 2012, shooting death of Martin, who was returning home from a convenience store where he had bought candy and an ice tea drink. Defense attorneys argued Martin provoked the attack, inciting Zimmerman, the only surviving eyewitness, to shoot him in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unnamed juror who was a member of the six-woman panel told CNN that &quot;all of us thought race did not play a role&quot; in the case. But that statement has been met with the same kind of widespread disbelief among African-Americans and many others as the verdict itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watching the news Saturday was Andre V. Chapman, founder and CEO of the Unity Care Group, a San Jose-based nonprofit that helps guide foster youth into adulthood. With him were his 18-year-old son and five friends, who quickly took to Twitter to comment on the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a rainbow coalition of kids of all ethnicities, and they were all asking, 'How is this even possible?'&quot; said Chapman, a father of three. &quot;These kids watch this and then draw the parallels in their own lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict only reinforces societal perceptions that do little to help how Americans view each other, said Margalynne Armstrong, a Santa Clara University associate professor of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, she said, there is the idea that there are places where you're not supposed to be if you're an African-American. Another is that young black males must carefully &quot;toe the line&quot; in how they dress and act, or they risk being viewed as a threat by others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can't walk with their hood up or be aggressive in any way,&quot; added Armstrong, who teaches a course on race and the law. &quot;Well, that's a heavy burden to carry that other teenagers don't have to deal with just because they're not African-American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The specter of urban violence and &quot;all these images of black-on-black crime&quot; in the media only feed into stereotypes, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's complicated,&quot; Armstrong added. &quot;Those often are in neighborhoods of low income, low services and low opportunity. People move from those places for a better life for their families. But clearly they aren't always moving to places safer for young black males.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrations have been particularly tense in Oakland, where Oscar Grant was shot and killed by a BART officer in 2009. While many protesters are young white activists with no firsthand experience at the brunt of racism, for others, the experience was more personal. One 16-year-old black teen, wearing a symbolic white hoodie such as the one Martin was pictured wearing, told the crowd Tuesday night near Oakland's Lake Merritt he had to sneak out of his house to join the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My mama is fearful for my life because I'm out here at night,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend -- only adding to the resonance -- marked the national premiere of &quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; the film that recounts the final day in Grant's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was at the cinema that Gulledge found a place to reflect, joining crowds that lined up Monday at Oakland's Grand Lake Theater even as protesters were beginning to gather downtown for the third consecutive night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What bothered Gulledge most about the shooting trials of Zimmerman and the BART officer, Johannes Mehserle, was how the character of each victim was tarnished in order to justify why they were shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was more like Trayvon was on trial,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growing up in a middle-class family, Gulledge remembers how he and his dad were pulled over after a soccer game just for driving through the affluent Oakland hills, and that the profiling continued when he moved to Danville in his 20s. He even went to the town's police station to announce his presence, saying, &quot;Hey, this is who I am, I'm a black man living in this neighborhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dace's congregation in San Jose is about half African-American. And when kids had a discussion Sunday of their feelings about the Martin case, there was emotion and some fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are good kids here,&quot; Dace said. &quot;Some wear baggy jeans and hoodies. But they are our children. They are loved. And it's hurtful that other people don't see them that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- With police facing intensifying criticism from city leaders for again failing to prevent a small number of agitators from vandalizing downtown businesses during the tail end of mass protests, Chief Sean Whent gave no assurances Tuesday that he would get tougher on vandals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our focus in all these things is about safety of people over property,&quot; Whent said on KQED's Forum program. &quot;That includes the safety of citizens and police officers.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To illustrate the risks faced by police, Whent said that officers who raced across Broadway late last night to arrest vandals smashing windows at a Men's Warehouse were attacked by the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why we ended up deploying gas to basically rescue the officers out of there,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whent's comments contrasted sharply with those of Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck, whose force also has faced off with violent protesters following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beck warned the agitators Tuesday that &quot;if you come here again tonight, you will go to jail,&quot; the L.A. Times reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Jean Quan told KQED that police must do better but that the vandals are a slippery foe for an understaffed police department. &quot;It's a fine line to honor the tradition of protest in the city and on the other hand to get enough resources out to do the violence prevention,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's protests in Oakland were the largest and most violent since Saturday's jury verdict in a case that has sparked a national debate about racial profiling. Hundreds of protesters briefly took over a section of Interstate 880 early in the evening. Shortly after 11 p.m. a much smaller group of masked vandals began smashing windows downtown. One waiter at a downtown restaurant was hit in the face while trying to stop a hammer-wielding vandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I was a retailer thinking about coming to downtown Oakland, I wouldn't do it given what's transpired the last few nights,&quot; Councilman Larry Reid said. &quot;My business couldn't be protected, and my employees couldn't be protected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reid and other city leaders fear that after years of being accused of acting too aggressively against protesters -- and paying out tens of millions of dollars in police misconduct lawsuits -- officers now are showing too much restraint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department currently is under federal supervision after failing to satisfy court-mandated reforms. The court-appointed federal overseer, former Baltimore Police Commissioner Thomas Frazier, had previously excoriated the department's handling of the 2011 Occupy Oakland protests that resulted in 44 officers facing disciplinary charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Councilman Ignacio De La Fuente said police are being reigned in by outside powers calling the shots. &quot;The result is that they're not doing what they are supposed to do when they see people committing a crime or violating the law,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frazier could not be reached for comment Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whent said he didn't think the fallout from the Occupy protests or recent million-dollar settlements awarded to protesters had made officers shy away from conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it's in the back of their minds, that could be a possibility, but I don't think that is the case,&quot; he said during an afternoon news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whent said that police were caught off-guard by the size and intensity of Monday's protest. After hundreds of demonstrators marched onto the freeway, police reassigned officers from elsewhere in the city and received additional help from nine outside police agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With their numbers augmented, police were able to flank protesters, which put them in a better position to target troublemakers, Whent said. Police made nine arrests Monday, after making just one the previous two nights of protests. Whent said that might not seem like much but added that there were relatively few agitators interspersed among the protesters. &quot;It's very difficult to march into a crowd of several hundred people to grab a few who are breaking windows,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilman Dan Kalb wouldn't criticize police but said the only way to stop the vandals was to bring them to justice. &quot;We need to arrest people who are breaking windows and committing violent acts,&quot; he said. &quot;And we need to arrest as many of them as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us assume that, within the narrow constraints of the evidence at hand and Florida's bizarre gun laws, six good women rendered the only verdict they could Saturday night in acquitting George Zimmerman of murder and manslaughter in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Even so, the problem remains. Whatever legal closure it gives, this verdict does not satisfy, any more than a guilty verdict would have, the central moral question here:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why did Zimmerman regard Trayvon as suspicious when all he did was wear a hooded sweatshirt while walking in the rain? Why did initial police reports designate Trayvon the suspect when he was actually the unarmed victim? Why was his assailant able to go home that same night?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents have consistently rejected any notion that race played a role in his death. It was a smart position, reflecting a recognition that when race enters the conversation, reason often exits, compassion following close behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But truth is, race has been there at every turn. If man and boy had both been black or white, we would never have heard of either. There likely would not even have been a shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many of us as African-Americans, that night was a recurring nightmare driven to a horrific conclusion. It was the driving-while-black traffic stops, the &quot;born suspect&quot; joke that isn't, the cost of being black in a nation that considers black the natural color of criminality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people -- most of them white and on the furthest right of the political spectrum -- will disagree. For them, Zimmerman is the victim here, a man who acted justifiably to defend himself. Race, they will say, did not enter the picture except afterward, when he was thrown to the mob because of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And you wonder: What color is the sky on their world?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years ago, &quot;What Would You Do?&quot; an ABC-TV hidden-camera show, set up a situation where two actors posed as bike thieves in a public park, using bolt cutters and hacksaws to cut a bike chain. The results were instructive. Over the course of an hour, a hundred people passed the white &quot;thief&quot; by with barely a glance. The black one had hardly gotten to work before a crowd of whites gathered around him, interrogating him, lecturing him, calling 911, even shooting cellphone video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did race explain the disparity? &quot;Not at all,&quot; a white man who had harassed the black actor assured the cameras. &quot;He could've been any color, it wouldn't have mattered to me.&quot; He doubtless believed what he said. For some of us, though, it has a tired, heard-before quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, after all, the kind of thing some people always say when you complain of voter ID laws that will peel black voters off the rolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or when you condemn Republican presidential candidates for using &quot;welfare&quot; as a dog-whistle word of racial acrimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or when an unarmed boy is killed and the man who did the killing doesn't even spend the night in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the answer to the moral questions that killing raises is not mysterious to some of us. We know how America is. We know, for instance, that it regards black men as inherently criminal, jails them disproportionately because of that belief, then points to the fact that they are disproportionately jailed as proof of that belief. We know, in other words, that where people who look like Trayvon are concerned, America is a little nuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we know what stalked Trayvon down that street last year. We know what killed him. And we know why the people who were paid to give a damn about that, didn't. You see, we have not the luxury of self-delusion. We have sons and grandsons and nephews, and we must teach them, too, how America is. They are cocky and invincible in the way boys always are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they all look like Trayvon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it was an overstatement at all,&quot; Thompson, the only African-American running for mayor, said. &quot;If you listened and looked at the trial, it was an unfortunate statement of fact.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE OF the six jurors who acquitted George Zimmerman sparked outrage Monday night, saying race played no role in the fatal shooting of Travyon Martin and making comments that suggested a bias toward black people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37, who had tried to peddle a book about the trial that transfixed America until pulling back on that late Monday, came under fire on social media and beyond after she expressed loads of sympathy for Zimmerman and little for Trayvon during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think George Zimmerman is a man whose heart was in the right place, but just got displaced by the vandalism in the neighborhoods, and wanting to catch these people so badly, that he went above and beyond what he really should have done,&quot; the woman said, speaking from behind a shadow to hide her identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His heart was in the right place. It just went terribly wrong,&quot; Juror B37 added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror, who when asked to describe Trayvon during a pre-trail interview called the 17-year-old &quot;a boy of color,&quot; acknowledged on CNN that Zimmerman should have stayed in his car rather than follow the unarmed teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the first member of the all-female panel to speak out after Saturday's verdict said the jury decided to clear the 29-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer because they believed Zimmerman feared for his life moments before the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 had &quot;no doubt&quot; in her mind about that, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told Cooper she &quot;was sure&quot; the voice heard screaming for help on a 911 tape was the man carrying a handgun, not the high school student who was shot to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said it was Trayvon - not Zimmerman - who must have struck the first blow in February 2012 in a gated community outside Orlando. &quot;I feel sorry for both of them,&quot; the juror said. &quot;I feel sorry for Trayvon, in the situation he was in. And I feel sorry for George because of the situation he got himself in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That didn't go over too well on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Juror B37 says she feels bad for both of them? Um, there's only ONE, now,&quot; Twitter user Brooks Baptiste posted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting has inspired furious debate over gun rights and race relations for a year and a half, with protesters marching through Manhattan Sunday to decry the lack of justice for black victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Juror B37 said in the CNN interview that she thinks Zimmerman would have &quot;reacted the exact same way&quot; had Trayvon been &quot;Spanish, white, Asian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she made at least one statement on &quot;Anderson Cooper 360&quot; that could have been construed as racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The host asked her about testimony that Trayvon used the phrase &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot; to describe Zimmerman, 29, after the older man started to follow him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it's really racial. I think it's just the everyday life, the type of life that they live, and how they're living, in the environment that they're living in,&quot; she told Cooper, using &quot;they&quot; to refer to black people, specifically Trayvon and a female friend of his who testified during the Zimmerman trial about being on the phone with him just before the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remark infuriated some on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Juror B37 is a racist,&quot; user Rae-Ann Newallo wrote. &quot;That's how 'they' talk? Now I understand why Zimmerman got off. That jury was . . . a bunch of racists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37, a white woman who is the daughter of an Air Force captain and volunteers rescuing animals, said the jury relied partly on Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law that allows people to defend themselves with force when confronted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she was moved by testimony from Sanford, Fla., cop Chris Serino, who said he thought Zimmerman - who never took the stand - had told the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serino told federal agents Zimmerman was &quot;overzealous&quot; and emboldened by a &quot;little hero complex&quot; - but not racist, according to an FBI report posted on The Smoking Gun website Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During an interview with the feds, Serino said he'd found no evidence that the incident between the watchman and Trayvon was motivated by race. &quot;Zimmerman's actions were not based on Trayvon's skin color, (but) rather based on his attire, the total circumstances of the encounter and the previous burglary suspects in the community,&quot; the agents wrote in a report dated March 5, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race was not a topic of discussion at any point during deliberations, Juror B37 said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror, her voice breaking with emotion at one point, said Trayvon was partly to blame for his own death. &quot;I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think both of them could have walked away. It just didn't happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twitter users were furious at that comment, noting that Zimmerman followed Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not inevitable that Zimmerman would be cleared at trial and set free, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the panel started deliberations, three jurors were ready to to vote for acquittal, two were leaning toward a manslaughter verdict and one wanted second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 said &quot;a couple&quot; jurors were initially determined to find Zimmerman &quot;guilty of something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after struggling to understand instructions that Juror B37 called &quot;confusing,&quot; they reached a consensus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want people to know that we put everything into everything to get this verdict,&quot; the woman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after the spot, the witness who testified about Trayvon calling Zimmerman a &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot; appeared live on CNN's &quot;Piers Morgan Tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rachel Jeantel, 19, was battered in the witness box by defense lawyer Don West and ridiculed by many for her halting answers. She seemed more confident Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeantel called the verdict &quot;B.S.&quot; and said Zimmerman approached Trayvon because he was black. &quot;It was racial,&quot; said Jeantel. &quot;Let's be honest. Racial. If he were white, if Trayvon was white and he had a hoodie on, what would happen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Trayvon&nbsp;Martin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(He's) a boy of color.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On George Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think George Zimmerman is a man whose heart was in the right place, but just got displaced by the vandalism in the neighborhoods, and wanting to catch these people so badly, that he went above and beyond what he really should have done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On whether Zimmerman racially profiled Trayvon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think he did. I think just circumstances caused George to think that he might be a robber, or trying to do something bad in the neighborhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On whether she thought race played a role in the case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it did. I think if there was another person - Spanish, white, Asian - if they came in the same situation where Trayvon was, I think George would have reacted the exact same way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On what she thought of the phrase &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot; - used by witness Rachel Jeantel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Trayvon probably said that ... I don't think it's really racial. I think it's just everyday life, the type of life that they live, and how they're living, in the environment that they're living in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GEORGE ZIMMERMAN'S parents are praying for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gladys and Robert Zimmerman told ABC News' Barbara Walters that they are struggling to cope with their new life in the aftermath of their son's acquittal in the fatal shooting of the unarmed 17-year-old. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are deeply sorry for this tragedy. We pray for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Gladys said, speaking publicly Monday for the first time since the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Zimmerman said that the family is terrified of the hostility directed at them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've had an enormous amount of death threats,&quot; Robert said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's nothing I can tell (the people making the threats),&quot; Gladys added. &quot;But I can pray for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They strongly defended their son, who has been derided as a trigger-happy, wanna-be cop eager to challenge a black teen he assumed was up to no good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not a racist. He wasn't taught to be a racist,&quot; Robert said of his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gladys even sought to explain her son's lack of emotion in the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What you see is a composed person. That's what you will see in all my kids,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She revealed to Walters she hasn't spoken much with George, 29, since the verdict, because he fears someone would eavesdrop on their phone conversations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, new details emerged of the early days of the investigation into the deadly February 2012 shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Sanford, Fla., investigator thought George Zimmerman wasn't a racist, but instead a bit &quot;overzealous&quot; and emboldened by a &quot;little hero complex,&quot; according to an FBI report posted on The Smoking Gun website Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During an interview with FBI special agents, Sanford cop Chris Serino said he'd found no evidence that the incident between the volunteer neighborhood watchman and Trayvon was motivated by race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zimmerman's actions were not based on Martin's skin color, (but) rather based on his attire, the total circumstances of the encounter and the previous burglary suspects in the community,&quot; the agents wrote in a report dated March 5, 2012 - about a week after the deadly confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman may have mistook Trayvon for a member of the Goons, a local street gang whose members often wore black hoodies, the report indicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings highlighted the challenges the Justice Department faces as it considers bringing civil rights charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other developments:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nl Attorney General Eric Holder called Trayvon's killing &quot;a tragic, unnecessary&quot; shooting and pledged his prosecutors would follow &quot;the facts and the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nl White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Obama would not directly involve himself in the Justice Department investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nl Six members of New York City's congressional delegation applauded the Justice Department for its probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nnl The NYPD made 15 arrests and issued one summons Sunday during protests over the verdict, mostly for disorderly conduct. nnl A prominent literary agent revealed she is shopping a book proposal by one of the still-unnamed jurors who acquitted Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marissa Alexander fired her gun to scare off her allegedly menacing husband and she got 20 years behind bars. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case of Alexander, 31, of Jacksonville, Fla., has become Exhibit A for people who say Zimmerman's acquittal illustrates how the U.S. justice system places less value on the lives of black people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This African-American woman didn't hurt anyone and now she might not hug her children for 20 years,&quot; wrote Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.) after Alexander's conviction in May 2012.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAYORAL HOPEFUL William Thompson on Monday defended his provocative comments in the aftermath of the Trayvon Martin verdict, saying he was merely &quot;stating the obvious.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after George Zimmerman's acquittal of all charges in Trayvon's death, Thompson sent out this message Saturday night to his 4,200 followers on Twitter:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon Martin was killed because he was black. There was no justice done today in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it was an overstatement at all,&quot; Thompson, the only African-American running for mayor, said. &quot;If you listened and looked at the trial, it was an unfortunate statement of fact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some criticized Thompson's remarks. City Councilman Eric Ulrich (R-Queens) said he would &quot;expect this type of remark from (the Rev. Al Sharpton), not from you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson's tweet was seen as out of character for the cautious candidacy he has run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Quinnipiac poll released Monday showed that Thompson is in third place among black Democrats.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE OF the six jurors who acquitted George Zimmerman in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case says she &quot;was sure&quot; the voice heard screaming for help on a 911 tape was the man carrying a handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Juror B37, who is planning to write a book about the trial that transfixed America, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she thinks Zimmerman - the man who shot Martin dead - meant well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think George Zimmerman is a man whose heart was in the right place, but just got displaced by the vandalism in the neighborhoods, and wanting to catch these people so badly, that he went above and beyond what he really should have done,&quot; the woman said, speaking from behind a shadow to hide her identity. &quot;His heart was in the right place. It just went terribly wrong.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first member of the all-female panel to speak out after Saturday's verdict says &quot;a couple&quot; of jurors wanted to find Zimmerman &quot;guilty of something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they started deliberations, three were ready to vote for acquittal, two were leaning toward a manslaughter verdict and one wanted second-degree murder. But they eventually decided to clear the defendant because they believed Zimmerman feared for his life in the moments before the killing that transfixed the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 says it was Martin - not Zimmerman - who must have thrown the first blow and believes race played no role in the encounter that left the 17-year-old dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror was full of sympathy for the neighborhood watch volunteer and his version of the February 2012 encounter in his Florida gated community - though Zimmerman did not testify. She made at least one statement on &quot;Anderson Cooper 360&quot; that bordered on being biased. The host asked her about testimony that Martin used the phrase &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot; to describe Zimmerman, 29, after the older man started to follow him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it's really racial. I think it's just the everyday life, the type of life that they live, and how they're living, in the environment that they're living in,&quot; she told Cooper, apparently referring to Martin and his pal who testified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness, teenager Rachel Jeantel, appeared live Monday on CNN's &quot;Piers Morgan Tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Battered in the witness box by defense lawyer Don West and ridiculed by many in the public for her halting answers, Jeantel hit back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She called the verdict &quot;B.S.&quot; and said Zimmerman profiled Martin because he was black - not because her friend was a threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was trying to get home ... and that's a fact,&quot; Jeantel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was &quot;not a thug&quot; and although he smoked weed about twice a week, marijuana made him &quot;hungry,&quot; not crazy, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Monday, Zimmerman's parents told ABC News' Barbara Walters that they are struggling to cope with their new life in the aftermath of the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are deeply sorry for this tragedy. We pray for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Gladys Zimmerman said, speaking publicly Monday for the first time since the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Zimmerman said that the family is terrified of the hostility directed at them. &quot;We've had an enormous amount of death threats,&quot; Robert said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They strongly defended their son, who has been derided as a trigger-happy, wanna-be cop eager to challenge a black teen he assumed was up to no good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not a racist. He wasn't taught to be a racist,&quot; Robert said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMERICA'S top justice official pledged yesterday to tackle &quot;the underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs and stereotypes&quot; behind violence against young people as demands by black leaders grew for George Zimmerman to be charged with federal hate crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The comments by Eric Holder, the US attorney-general, were his clearest reference to claims that Mr Zimmerman, 29, shot dead 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin after racially profiling the unarmed black teenager as a possible criminal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The neighbourhood watch volunteer was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges on Saturday in a verdict that has provoked protests across the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Holder, who described Trayvon's killing as &quot;tragic, unnecessary&quot;, con-firmed that the Justice Department had re-opened a federal investigation into Mr Zimmerman that had been on hold while the court case played out in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Holder's comments seemed to indicate scepticism about Mr Zimmerman's successful self-defence case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But legal experts said that his department would face major challenges in any attempt to prove that Mr Zimmerman's actions were based on racial discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Holder tacitly acknowledged those difficulties in his speech celebrating the 100th anniversary of a black university sorority in Washington. But his comments also reflected pressure from civil rights leaders on him and President Barack Obama, who are the first African-Americans to hold their positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are mindful of the pain felt by our nation surrounding the tragic, unnecessary shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; the attorney-general said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I want to assure you that the department will continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law. We are determined to meet division and confusion with understanding and compassion - and also with truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are resolved to combat violence involving or directed at young people, to prevent future tragedies and to deal with the underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs and stereotypes that serve as the basis for these too common incidents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He spoke as leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, the biggest US black rights group, intensified demands for a federal prosecution at a meeting in Orlando, a 30-minute drive from Sanford, where Trayvon was shot dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Al Sharpton, the activist black preacher, said he would head to Sanford and announced plans for protests in 100 cities this weekend to increase pressure on the Justice Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protesters gathered across the United States on Sunday night to voice their anger in mostly peaceful demonstrations, including large-scale marches in Los Angeles and New York. There were some clashes in Los Angeles, where police said they made several arrests and fired bean bag rounds after coming under attack by rocks and batteries from some protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Manhattan, thousands of marchers brought Times Square to a standstill. Jay Carney, Mr Obama's spokesman, said that the president would not be involved in the decision on whether to bring federal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Sunday, Mr Obama called for calm as &quot;we ask ourselves how we can prevent future tragedies like this&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Justice Department noted the &quot;limited&quot; federal criminal civil rights statutes that were available when it announced a review of the Zimmerman case. There was also a growing consensus yesterday from legal experts who warned that the government would need to show clear-cut racism on the part of Mr Zimmerman before it could proceed - something the criminal trial had failed to establish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;From what I've seen this would be a very difficult case to prosecute federally because the government would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that George Zimmerman acted because of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's race,&quot; Samuel Bagenstos, a former official in the Justice Department's civil rights division, told the Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Civil rights leaders have urged the government to pursue a case in the mould of the successful prosecutions of police officers who were initially acquitted over the infamous beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles in March 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Mr Zimmerman has remained in hiding. Mark O'Mara, his lawyer, said that he would be receiving back the pistol with which he shot Trayvon, indicating that death threats meant he required it as protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also said that his client wanted to go to law school. &quot;He has a real interest in the law,&quot; he said. &quot;Prosecuting appropriately - not like what he got - is something he's very interested in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The six female jurors who unanimously acquitted Mr Zimmerman are also yet to speak. But a literary agency said that one juror had signed with it to give her version of the trial in a book in which she would say the panel had &quot;no option&quot; but to find the accused not guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROTESTS are continuing to spread across the US -- with at least one turning violent -- following the not-guilty verdict for George Zimmerman after he shot teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin dead . </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrations, from Florida where the trial took place to Atlanta, DC, and New York, remained peaceful last night -- although violence erupted in Oakland, California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, a hotbed of racial tension, some protesters turned violent -- vandalising police cars, breaking windows and setting fire to garbage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One photo from the protests in the city shows men dousing an American flag in lighter fluid and setting it alight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least three separate protests were scheduled for New York City -- one in lower Manhattan, one in Harlem and a third in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oakland demonstration followed a raucous but largely peaceful rally in San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict also sparked protests in Los Angeles, where demonstrators gathered in Leimert Park, the city's historically black neighbourhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police were put on tactical alert, but there were no reports of any arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celebrities continued to address the verdict, with pop superstar Beyonce stopping her Mrs Carter Show World Tour concert at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, to honour the slain teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her concert started about 30 minutes after the Zimmerman verdict began to circulate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I'd like to have a moment of silence for Trayvon,'' the pop star said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyonce then sang the chorus of Dolly Parton's I Will Always Love You, before transitioning into her hit Halo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow celeb Rihanna took to Twitter to express her celebrity outrage, tweeting, 'This is the saddest news ever!!! #whatsjustice.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US civil rights groups furious at a state jury's acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of black teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin are looking to another racially charged case -- the Rodney King beating -- to take the the matter to federal courts . . . but legal experts warn it will be an uphill battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department has a host of criminal civil-rights laws at its disposal, and has made such cases in the past. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them was the federal prosecution of a group of Los Angeles police officers after they were acquitted in state court of the brutal beating of Rodney King in 1991, which sparked riots in that city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the four officers were eventually convicted by a federal jury of violating King's civil rights under ``colour of law'' -- that is, beating him up in their capacity as police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Los Angeles suburb of Oakland, which had the worst of the 1991 rioting after the initial King verdict, erupted into sporadic violence yesterday, the Zimmerman finding failed to spill over in largely peaceful protests in Miami, New York and Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there were still enough similarities in the two cases for civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton to link Mr Martin's death to the King beating while NAACP president Benjamin Jealous said federal criminal charges must be filed because evidence suggests race was a factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, legal experts pointed out that the colour of law rule applies only to those in law enforcement. A Neighbourhood Watch volunteer in Sanford, Florida, Mr Zimmerman was found by a jury to have justifiably shot 17-year-old Mr Martin in self-defence, is a civilian -- ironically, one who wanted to be a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his case, it's possible the Justice Department might consider using a different type of civil-rights law: the federal hate-crime statute. As in the King case, the double-jeopardy clause of the US Constitution does not prohibit such a federal prosecution after Mr Zimmerman's state acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But legal experts said it would be a formidable challenge for Attorney-General Eric H Holder Jr to make a hate-crime case against Zimmerman under US civil rights laws, because Florida jurors found Mr Zimmerman not guilty of both second-degree murder and manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is certain is that enormous pressure on Mr Holder, the first African-American Attorney-General, will grow in coming days. President Barack Obama issued a statement backing the Zimmerman not-guilty verdict, saying the shooting of Mr Martin was a tragedy but a ``jury has spoken''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. ``But we are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin spoke with their attorney about what happens next -- possibilities also include a wrongful-death case against Mr Zimmerman in civil court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RACE IN US CASES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman: George Zimmerman was only charged over the death of Travyon Martin six weeks after the February, 2012, shooting, when civil rights leaders demanded action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rodney King: Four LAPD officers were charged in 1992 following the release of video of King being beaten. They were acquitted, a decision which triggered riots across Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The angry protests highlight simmering racial tensions after a jury found volunteer watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators held noisy rallies in US cities including New York, San Francisco, Boston, Detroit and Chicago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in the multiracial crowd brandished signs bearing a portrait of Mr Martin, while some, despite sweltering heat, wore ``hoodie'' sweatshirts as the teen did the night he was killed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GEORGE Zimmerman's acquittal for murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin has put American race relations back under the spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There may be an African-American in the White House but racial tensions are never far from the surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was shot by Zimmerman, 28, last February while walking to a relative's house in Florida holding a drink and some sweets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday the jury found Zimmerman - himself Hispanic - not guilty of second-degree murder. But does the verdict prove America is still mired in racial prejudice? And how does Britain compare when it comes to health, education and crime?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRISON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black people are overwhelmingly more likely to be jailed or executed than white people in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black people account for 13.1% of the US's 319 million people, yet make up 37.1% of the prison population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when it comes to death row, the statistics are even more startling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research found black defendants facing trial in Houston - dubbed the US death penalty capital - were more than three times as likely to be handed a possible death sentence than white ones. But white inmates on death row just outnumber black inmates - 43.2% compared to 41.9%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race of the victim also appears to play a part in a defendants' likelihood to be sentenced to death. Since 1976, 20 white defendants have been executed for killing a black victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 261 black defendants have been executed for killing a white victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain, ethnic minority inmates are also over-represented. In 2009, 10% of the prison population was black compared to 2% of the general population, according to the Prison Reform Trust. And between 1999 and 2002, the prison population grew by more than 12%, but the number of black prisoners increased by 51%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEALTH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White people live longer than black people, according to the American Department of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their 2011 study said whites had an expected lifespan of 78.8 years compared to 74.5 for blacks. And the American College of Physicians said in 2010: &quot;Overwhelming evidence shows that racial and ethnic minorities are prone to poorer quality healthcare than white Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disparities are seen in other ailments too. For instance, 16.4% of black children aged under 18 have asthma compared to 8.4% of white children. But only 7% of black children are prescribed asthma medication compared to 21% of whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, last year it emerged the group suffering the worst decline in life expectancy was the white working-class, in some cases reverting back to levels not seen in 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White working-class women saw their life expectancy fall from more than 78 in 1990 to 74 in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain, estimates from think-tank the Runnymede Trust reveal white men live on average a year longer on than Afro-Caribbean men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gap for women, meanwhile, was just five months. And Bangladeshi men have the lowest estimated life expectancy of all males - just 74.6 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INCOME</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black people are more likely to live in poverty than whites, who in turn have a higher chance of earning the top salaries. According to 2010 figures, 39.1% of black children live in poverty compared to just 12.4% of white children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, black Americans earned an average of &pound;401 per week. White workers took home 25% more and were on &pound;500, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. And more than 50% of black people aged 15 and above earned less than &pound;23,200 in 2008 compared with 35% of whites, the Census Bureau found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High earners were also much more likely to be white. While 10.8% of white workers made more than &pound;66,200, just 3.3% of black workers did. It is estimated there are fewer than 800 black executives in the top levels of Fortune 500 firms - equating to 2%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain does not fare much better, with the first black chief executive not promoted until 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 4.1% of FTSE 100 company directors come from ethnic minority backgrounds. And in terms of poverty, around two-fifths of ethnic minorities live in low-income households - double the rate for white people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDUCATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are gaps in educational achievement between black and white students, but experts put this down to poverty rather than race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some areas, African-American and Latino pupils aged 17 and 18 performed maths and reading at the level of 13-year-old white students, a study by the Education Trust found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It argued the disparity was down to poverty, an issue faced disproportionately by black youngsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while 34% of white people had degrees compared with 20% of black people, it was claimed that class had a bigger impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was backed by figures showing 79% of the richest quarter of US people get a degree compared to just 11% of the poorest quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, here it was said last month that poor white pupils were least likely to succeed at school. The inspectorate of schools found that since 2007, their Teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, George Zimmerman, left attainment was up just 13%, against a 22% leap from poor Bangladeshi pupils.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dinalynn Andrews Potter, 43, was arrested Saturday by Hayward police on suspicion of battery and then cited and released, according to the San Jose Mercury News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A records official at the Hayward Police Department, when reached by phone late Monday afternoon, confirmed that the suspect's listed city of residence was Barstow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional calls Monday to the department's public information office for further details were not immediately returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not clear if charges will be filed against Andrews Potter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police shot beanbag rounds and arrested six people - including one on suspicion of assaulting an officer - while breaking up relatively small demonstrations Sunday and before dawn on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No injuries were reported to either demonstrators or officers, but Garcetti decided to return &quot;out of an abundance of caution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He encourages people to exercise their First Amendment rights but does believe in keeping the peace on the streets of Los Angeles and believes non-violence is a very potent tool,&quot; mayoral spokesman Yusef Robb said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garcetti doesn't want the message to be &quot;overshadowed by violence,&quot; Robb said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new mayor was supposed to visit Maryland on Monday and then move on to Washington, D.C., later in the week to meet with the transportation secretary and California congressional delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not immediately clear whether he would be able to resume the trip, Robb said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters in Los Angeles and Oakland blocked traffic and clashed with police on Sunday in protests over a Florida jury's acquittal of neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in the shooting death of the unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, most demonstrations around the state were peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Los Angeles on Sunday, several hundred protesters demonstrated in the Mid-City area, and some marched onto Interstate 10 in Los Angeles and blocked traffic for close to a half-hour before police moved them away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That night, a smaller group of demonstrators entered the lobby of the W luxury hotel in Hollywood and then trooped to Sunset Boulevard to chant &quot;no justice, no peace&quot; in front of the CNN building, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of police in helmets and face shields declared an unlawful assembly after midnight on Monday and moved in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some non-lethal beanbag ammunition was fired during that confrontation, officer Gregory Baek said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, police confronted members of a crowd who began breaking windows and spray-painting graffiti at a downtown intersection on Sunday night, the Oakland Tribune reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters marched about five miles before sitting at a major intersection and blocking traffic. The Tribune said the crowd was largely peaceful, but by 10 p.m. a smaller group of protesters began vandalizing businesses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict by a Florida jury that George Zimmerman is not guilty of murder or manslaughter in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin settles -- pending review by the U.S. Justice Department -- the legal question of his criminal culpability. Jurors listened attentively and deliberated carefully, and the rule of law must be respected. But the central tragedy of this case -- the death of a 17-year-old boy who had been on a simple errand to get snacks remains.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have no further business with the court,&quot; the Seminole County judge told Zimmerman moments after the jury of six women at 9:47 p.m. Saturday delivered the twin verdicts of not guilty to the tense courtroom and to a national audience attracted by the cable television coverage. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, shot Martin on Feb. 26, 2012, claiming self-defense after he said the teenager knocked him to the ground and hit his head against the sidewalk. Prosecutors had argued that Zimmerman instigated the confrontation by assuming the youth had no place in the gated Sanford community and was up to no good and then following him against the express advice of police. Martin, who was unarmed, was walking back to his father's home after going to a store for candy and a soft drink.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Never a simple homicide, Martin's death became the subject of a charged debate about race, criminal profiling and Florida's permissive &quot;stand your ground&quot; gun law. Despite the jury's verdict, those issues are not likely to go away. One reason the death of this boy in a gray hooded sweatshirt so resonated that even the president of the United States felt compelled to comment was that it brought to the surface historic concerns of minority parents about the vulnerability of their sons. The ineptness of Florida authorities in the initial investigation of this death validated that worry and deepened the distrust.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Unfortunately, though, much of the public debate has done grievous disservice to the legitimacy of these issues. Hucksters and political demagogues exploited tragedy a boy's death, a family's grief, a man's freedom and created what has become the now all-too-familiar media circus of oversaturation and rush to judgment.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Zimmerman's attorney called the prosecution &quot;disgraceful.&quot; But we think it was valuable that the case was aired in an open court before a fair-minded judge and decided by a jury that appeared to be careful and take its time. Guilt was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and Zimmerman is free to resume his life even as his attorney lamented that it &quot;will never be the same.&quot;<BR><BR><BR><BR> That also is as it should be. Zimmerman could have done what police told him to do and stayed in his vehicle. No one would have heard about him and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been able to get home on that rainy Sunday evening.<BR><BR><BR><BR> -- The Washington Post  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re &quot;Martin family, Justice Dept. could weigh in on symbol of racial divide,&quot; July 15: Where were President Obama and the DO J after the verdict in the Casey Anthony trial? Apparently, you don't count if you are a 2-year-old Caucasian girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After listening to the various Sunday morning shows, it's apparent that &quot;justice&quot; is only justice if you get the verdict that you want. I can't believe that the federal government is looking into another trial (civil rights suit). It's easier to believe that the NAACP is involved with pushing the civil rights issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I really hate to say it and I wish it weren't true, but no one is more racist than the black TV talking heads and the black protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dehumanizing or profiling Trayvon&nbsp;Martin or any black is a method used by those who promote racism, segregation or stereotypes, etc., and who live a life absent from God's truths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was not treated as a white teenager would have been treated. Sane whites know this, but the conservative jurists could not connect the dots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This talk of race is nonsense. In the dark, in the rain, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had his hood up. There was no way George Zimmerman could have even known he was black when he first addressed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas demonstrations against George Zimmerman's acquittal are understandable, one has to wonder why there was silence over O.J. Simpson's acquittal on two murders, especially when the former was based on merits of the case while the latter on technicalities of legal procedures?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman was told to stay in his vehicle until police arrived. He did not do so and he caused this tragedy. Where were the juror's heads? I guess they can't hear and they failed miserably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess just because Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was black, he was innocent. Sad that people see only the color of his skin and turn a blind eye to the evidence. Those are the people who are really the racists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overt methods of white entitlement, racism and profiling superseded the rights of a black child to simply walk home. The tone of the defense's case proved this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real culprit in the George Zimmerman trial is the Florida state legislature. They passed a law that allows &quot;would-be&quot; vigilantes to hassle their neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had killed George Zimmerman, could he have claimed &quot;stand your ground?&quot; Or does that law only apply to white people with concealed weapons?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re &quot;'Stand your ground' law needed in Ohio?,&quot; June 28: The &quot;stand your ground&quot; idiocy only gives these clowns an excuse to mow down anyone who seemingly upsets them and have the law on their side. In light of what's happened in Florida, I think it's another way for the NRA to gain more power. Enough craziness is going on without adding to the mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re the letter &quot;Ohio's citizens do not need guns,&quot; July 10: Once again, we are witness to the irrational mania surrounding the gun debate. Ban guns? Seriously, what leads one to believe that any criminal will abide by such a ban, which, by the way, would leave the law-abiding at a clear disadvantage? Furthermore, the notion of a Wild West is a myth. Research it and you will find that there was as much, if not more, gun control than exists today. The Wild West was a lot less wild than today's Chicago. It's time to bring rationality back to the debate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 16--Because of the reckless actions of George Zimmerman, 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin died, fatally shot by Mr. Zimmerman on Feb. 26, 2012. The teenager was doing nothing illegal when Mr. Zimmerman decided to track him -- in the process ignoring a police dispatcher's instructions &quot;we don't need you to do that&quot; -- and the teen was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had Mr. Zimmerman not crossed the line from neighborhood watch volunteer to armed vigilante, had he followed the dispatcher's instructions and allowed police in Sanford to handle the matter, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would almost certainly still be alive. Given those facts, it is terribly unfair that Mr. Zimmerman should walk from a Florida courtroom acquitted of any criminal wrongdoing by the six-person jury. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But criminal trials do not always produce &quot;fair&quot; outcomes. Results often have more to do with the skill of the lawyers, the strength of witnesses and the niceties of the law than they do with probity. In the end the prosecution was unable to make a convincing criminal case out of Mr. Zimmerman's actions and their tragic results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took six weeks, and intense public pressure in the form of nationwide demonstrations and critical editorial commentary, before the special prosecutor named to the case, Angela B. Corey, announced the filing of the charge of second-degree murder against Mr. Zimmerman for fatally shooting Mr. Martin in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the initial decision by police and a prosecutor not to charge Mr. Zimmerman with anything was derelict, the murder charge was arguably an overreach. It required the prosecution to prove Mr. Zimmerman acted with evil intent, hatred or spite. The evidence at trial did not indicate that, instead presenting the defendant as a misguided, self-styled avenger who, convinced the hoodie-wearing teen must have done something, was intent on not letting him &quot;get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the trial neared its end, the judge allowed jurors to also consider a lesser charge of manslaughter -- unlawful killing without malicious aforethought -- but in the opinion of the jury the prosecution fell short proving even that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end the state could not meet its high burden of proving criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt. The accounts of who began the fight after Mr. Zimmerman and Mr. Martin confronted one another, of who had the upper hand in the confrontation and who shouted what, were muddled and contradictory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key prosecution witness, medical examiner Dr. Shiping Bao, came across as unsure of his facts and ill prepared. The defense's forensic expert, Dr. Vincent Di Maio, appeared cool, and was confident and concise in his conclusion that the defendant was under attack. On such things do trials often turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury gave Mr. Zimmerman the benefit of the doubt that he feared for his life when and fired in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which allows people who fear harm not to retreat, was not a factor in the trial. Yet it remains a terrible law, one that encourages vigilantism. Traditional self-defense law, requiring individuals to retreat from a confrontation if at all possible before turning to deadly force, is the far better standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to say what role race played in these events, yet it is hard to imagine that an armed, young black man, pursuing and fatally shooting an unarmed light-skinned Hispanic adult after a struggle, would walk free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal authorities could pursue a civil-rights criminal prosecution, but proving this was a racially motivated hate crime would be difficult and we would urge prosecutors to proceed cautiously, if at all. The family of Mr. Martin could find some justice in pursuing a civil wrongful death claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of a young man's death came cries of injustice from across the country. The people got the trial they demanded, a trial that was appropriate. No one can demand an outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the interest in the George Zimmerman verdict and the fact that the NAACP and other groups are demanding federal action, we don't blame the Justice Department for assessing whether criminal civil rights charges might be legitimate now that Zimmerman has been acquitted. But we're deeply skeptical of proceeding with further charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same problems that hobbled the state in its pursuit of Zimmerman would face the Justice Department, beginning with the lack of witnesses to the deadly confrontation between Zimmerman and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there would be new problems, too. A civil rights charge would presumably require evidence that Zimmerman acted out of racial bias. Yet if hard evidence of such bigotry failed to surface in the past year and a half, it's hard to believe it would come to light now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, the Justice Department has played an important role historically in filing federal charges when a clear miscarriage of justice seems to have occurred in a case involving race. But if there was a miscarriage of justice here, it certainly isn't obvious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can argue that Sanford police fumbled the early handling of the investigation. You can say Zimmerman should have stayed in his car, should not have had a gun, or should have made any number of other decisions differently, but we simply do not know exactly how the final confrontation unfolded. Martin was the only other witness and he is dead; meanwhile, it so happens that he appears to have been on top of Zimmerman when the fatal shot was fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury's conclusions could not have been shocking to anyone who followed the case with an open mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, open minds and fair minded attitudes have not been the hallmarks of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin phenomenon since it burst into the national consciousness last year. Politicians, activists and commentators of both left and right have exploited the incident to make extravagant claims regarding, on the one hand, the American justice system and, on the other, civil rights ideology in the age of political correctness. And that discourse for the most part has been an ongoing disgrace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, the low point in this rush from balance may have been supplied by the media specifically, NBC News' racially inflammatory editing of Zimmerman's 911 call to police on the night of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the trial, it became clear the state overreached in charging Zimmerman with second degree murder, setting up unrealistic expectations among many. The Justice Department should heed that lesson before taking on what would appear to be a long shot prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday's verdict will be remembered as one of shame and disregard for human life. An innocent boy was gunned down and it seems that his life was not worthy enough to receive the justice that he deserved. It pains me to say this, but racism is alive and well in our country, and especially in Florida, where I lived for some time and experienced it myself, not because of my race, but because of my origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six women who acquitted George Zimmerman will have to live with their decision for the rest of their lives, and I feel compassion for them. The message they sent by their action is that it is OK to kill without any consequences. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is said that our country has the best judicial system in the world, but after what happened Saturday in Florida, it sounds hollow and untrue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every homicide is tragic, even more so when the killer is neither found nor charged. Justice occurs when a defendant receives a trial by a jury of his peers who consider the facts and the law and render a verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who express outrage, anger or disappointment at the outcome of the Zimmerman trial do not believe in justice and should closely re examine their own racial prejudices (for those not paying attention, there was not a single white male on the jury).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better yet, they should redirect their energies toward seeking justice for the 100 plus black victims of homicide in Chicago this year alone (19 in the first week of July) who barely warranted a mention in their local newspapers, much less a national media frenzy fueled by pundits in the racial industrial complex.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a dialysis professional, I care for chronically ill patients. So I'm concerned about &quot;fiscal cliff&quot; budget cuts announced July 1. Severe Medicare cuts could reduce dialysis services and force clinic closures just as kidney disease is escalating. It's heartbreaking and unjust to make critically ill people accept reduced care or travel longer distances for life saving dialysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kidney disease affects 1 in 7 Americans and is the eighth leading cause of death. As the disease progresses to kidney failure, individuals must seek transplantation or get dialysis three times a week to stay alive. In Colorado, 6,265 people have kidney failure, a 19 percent increase since 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dialysis is a lifeline to survival, so Medicare covers the cost of dialysis, regardless of age. Ninety percent of our patients are Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare barely covers the cost of dialysis care now, and new cuts would be devastating. Congress must protect people with kidney failure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If there is a greater cultural message to be gleaned from the much-publicized trial of George Zimmerman it is that young black men will be treated with suspicion in too many parts of America regardless of how innocent they may be. Racial profiling continues to be a problem in this country, influencing perceptions and standing as a barrier against fairness and equal treatment. Unfortunately the tragic incident at hand, in which Zimmerman confronted and ultimately killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin during an altercation, is not the vehicle to further discussions on how to deal with this problem.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a vehicle to determine whether Zimmerman's actions rose to the level of a crime. In a nation that values the rule of law, such a proceeding should never take on the emotional aspects of revenge. It must confine itself to facts and evidence. This case must be viewed against the backdrop of Florida's unique &quot;stand your ground&quot; law allowing the use of deadly force when someone feels in imminent danger. It must be viewed against evidence that left the jury feeling there was room for reasonable doubt as to whether Zimmerman ultimately acted in self-defense when he fired his weapon ? that the altercation he started had reached a point where he was in danger. The facts about that remain largely in doubt. But with so few witnesses, and with Martin deceased, prosecutors had a difficult time mounting a case. That may have been why police in Sanford, Fla., originally decided not to prosecute Zimmerman, a decision that generated the publicity that brought the case into the national spotlight. State Attorney Angela Corey decided after all to bring second-degree murder charges following a public outcry and intense media coverage. In the end there seemed to be plenty of evidence to convict Zimmerman of poor judgment, but not enough to convict him of a crime. This no doubt is weighing on the minds of those in the Justice Department who now are contemplating federal charges. Andrew Cohen of The Atlantic said it well when he wrote that such trials, &quot;can never act as moral surrogates to resolve the national debates they trigger.&quot; Such trials, he said, &quot;are instead tests of only that limited evidence a judge declares fit to be shared with jurors, who in turn are then admonished daily, hourly even, not to look beyond the corners of what they've seen or heard in court.&quot; The judge was not responsible for putting the nation's racial problems on trial. Her job was to assure Zimmerman got a fair trial in regards to the charges brought against him. And yet those national debates remain, as does what should be a local debate in Florida over self-defense laws. It is proper to confront attitudes based on skin color that influence judgment. It is not right, however, to turn a criminal trial such as this into a symbol of something it was not intended to confront. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW YORK (AP) ? Stevie Wonder says he won't perform in Florida and other states with a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law. In a video posted on YouTube, the 63-year-old singer said at a concert in Quebec City, Canada, on Sunday &quot;that until the 'stand your ground' law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again.&quot; Wonder added: &quot;Wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot; The &quot;stand your ground&quot; law allows people to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger. George Zimmerman shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin during a February 2012 confrontation in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman said he fired his gun in self-defense. A six-member jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges on Saturday. Wonder's representative said the singer had no further comment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An African American man might sit in the White House, but the US still has a fair distance to travel before realising its post-racial dream. That is the message of the George Zimmerman trial. On the night of February 26, 2012, 17-year-old high school student Trayvon Martin was walking back to his father's fiance's home in Sanford, Florida - his temporary residence - from the store when he was spotted by the 28-year-old Hispanic American George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch member for the gated community in which they both lived. Zimmerman called the police and reported a suspicious individual, then chose to exit his car and follow Martin on foot - armed with a pistol - despite being advised not to do so by the responder. It ended with a violent encounter between the two and Martin was shot dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict delivered over the weekend - that Zimmerman was not guilty of second-degree murder or manslaughter - is the legally correct one. Given the lack of witnesses and prosecutorial missteps, it was impossible to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Zimmerman was lying when he said that he was assaulted by Martin when trying to return to his car, feared for his life and therefore drew his gun and used it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the moral case to be made against Zimmerman - and about both the state of race relations in the US and the country's out of control gun culture - is far more damning. Zimmerman's irresponsible actions, taking it upon himself to play vigilante, have been justified by his defenders in terms that range from racial profiling, casting Martin as the cliche African American gangster in the making, to outright racist. On the other side of the fence, the sense of persecution has been widespread; any number of African Americans, both prominent personalities and average citizens, have spoken of how being targeted by the police is a way of life for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's gun culture, one of American society's most divisive issues, is no less problematic. Florida's Stand Your Ground law - Zimmerman had originally intended to use it in his defence - that allows an individual to use deadly force if he feels threatened is dangerously vague and open to subjective interpretation. Two dozen other states have similar laws on the statute books. Combined with widespread ownership of guns, this perverts otherwise admirable aspects of the American character; vigilantism and paranoia of the other masquerading as self-reliance and independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial may be over, but Martin's death is far from dealt with. Protests have already started in various parts of the country and the US Department of Justice has said that it will look into prosecuting Zimmerman under federal criminal civil rights statutes. However it is dealt with, the Zimmerman case is just an external manifestation of deeper problems that occasion honest dialogue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE vigilante who killed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was in hiding last night as protests against his acquittal of murder swept the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most demonstrations passed off peacefully after President Obama appealed for calm. But five people were arrested in Los Angeles and police fired bean bags at people who had blocked a motorway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrests were made after a protest outside a CNN building in Hollywood, where demonstrators chanted &quot;No Justice, No Peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, 29, was cleared of second-degree murder by a jury on Saturday. He shot dead Trayvon, 17, in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012, claiming self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, described by his lawyer as a &quot;pariah&quot;, went into hiding after death threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racially-charged case has divided America, with the black population angry at what they see as failed justice for the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were fears of widespread riots, similar to those in 1992 when four white policemen were cleared after being videoed beating black motorist Rodney King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With tensions running high, President Obama appealed for calm and asked people to respect the jury's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called Martin's death a tragedy, &quot;Not just for his family, or any one community, but for America&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman could face another trial, with the Department of Justice considering bringing race hate charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been a rough couple of days for Angela Corey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state attorney for the 4th Judicial Circuit, which covers Duval, Nassau, and Clay counties, has been criticized throughout the country for failure to convict George Zimmerman in 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death in Sanford. The governor appointed her as a special prosecutor in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A six-member jury found Zimmerman not guilty on counts of second-degree murder and lesser charges Saturday, setting off widespread outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal is a rare high-profile failure for Corey, and she will struggle with the perceptions this case generated, said former 4th Circuit Public Defender Bill White. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She doesn't take criticism well, and there's going to be a lot of second guessing,&quot; White said. &quot;But Angela will have her difficulties and she'll have to deal with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey, a conservative Republican, is in the odd situation of being blasted nationally by right-wing talk show hosts and columnists who say the decision to charge Zimmerman was politically motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the hall of shame goes Angela Corey, the prosecutor brought in to get an indictment,&quot; wrote conservative Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin. &quot;She proceeded to overcharge, grandstand and personify abuse of prosecutorial discretion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz called for Corey to be disbarred, saying she submitted affidavits that bordered on perjury and violated all kinds of rules of the profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She was among the most irresponsible prosecutors I've seen in 50 years of litigating cases,&quot; Dershowitz said on Fox News. &quot;And believe me, I've seen good prosecutors, bad prosecutors, but rarely have I seen one as bad as this prosecutor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locally, veteran Corey watchers say the acquittal is not the end of her time as a compelling figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will blow over,&quot; said former Mayor John Delaney, who was once Corey's boss at the State Attorney's Office. &quot;[Former Mayor and State Attorney] Ed Austin lost some high-profile cases, but it never damaged his reputation in the long run.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same will be true of Corey, said Delaney, now president of the University of North Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She will have little time to reflect on the outcome as another highly sensitive trial with racial connotations approaches. A pretrial hearing will occur at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday for Michael David Dunn, 46, who is accused of killing 17-year-old Jordan Davis in a dispute over loud music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Dunn, who is white, shot into a Dodge Durango with four teens in a dispute about loud music. Only Davis, who is black, was hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A trial is tentatively scheduled for September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey did not respond to requests for an interview with the Times-Union. She spoke to First Coast News, the Times-Union's news partner, and rejected suggestions that Zimmerman was overcharged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't charge based on what the verdict is going to be,&quot; Corey said. &quot;We charged what we think we can prove under the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COREY'S WEAKNESS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another interview with ABC News, she defended the decision to charge Zimmerman without going to a grand jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything went to trial and everything was public,&quot; Corey said. &quot;Shame on those who are bashing us for the sake of getting on TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Michael Hallett, head of UNF's criminal justice department, said this case exposed Corey's weaknesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My only thought is that Angela Corey lost the biggest case of her career by overcharging the suspect,&quot; Hallett said. &quot;But that's what she does all the time, and that will end up being her legacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited the Cristian Fernandez case as another example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fernandez was a 12-year-old boy accused of killing his 2-year-old half-brother. Corey sought to try him for first-degree murder as an adult, leading to an international outcry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He eventually pleaded guilty to manslaughter and received juvenile sanctions. He will be released from juvenile custody in January 2018, when he turns 19 and will be evaluated and treated for any psychological troubles and must also continue his education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Hank Coxe, who represented Fernandez, said he couldn't comment on Zimmerman, but his client was &quot;grossly overcharged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When overcharging happens, two things result: a loss of credibility with jurors, the judiciary and the community; and unwarranted, serious damage occurs to people,&quot; Coxe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman prosecution has also focused attention on Marissa Alexander, 32, currently serving a 20-year sentence after having fired what she said was a warning shot to protect herself from her abusive husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander cited the Stand Your Ground law to justify firing a shot that prosecutors said endangered her husband and two of her children. But that defense was rejected by the judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'SOMETHING WRONG'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown compared the two cases Monday and said it was incomprehensible that Alexander is in jail while Zimmerman gets to go free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is something wrong with the system,&quot; she said. &quot;The laws have to be revamped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not completely over as civil rights violations and a lawsuit are expected to be pursued next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hallett said the prosecution could have won a manslaughter conviction if they'd focused on that in the Zimmerman case, but they fixated on second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delaney said it's common practice to seek the highest possible charge. He also said it was ridiculous to suggest that Corey and lead prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda didn't know what they were doing when they have been prosecutors in murder cases for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those are two of the best and most experienced prosecutors in the state,&quot; Delaney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White, the former public defender, agreed that Zimmerman was overcharged but said that has become common in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know why it was a surprise that the state attorney overcharged someone,&quot; White said. &quot;I think any defense attorney would tell you that happens all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEXT UP, CIVIL RIGHTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Department of Justice said it would review the case for possible violations of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric Holder had begun the investigation last year into whether the deadly confrontation between George Zimmerman, 29, and Martin, 17, was motivated by racial profiling, but he stepped aside to let the trial in a Florida court proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the feds opened the door Sunday to reopening the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction and whether federal prosecution is appropriate,&quot; the Justice Department said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who was in hiding and fearing for his life after the verdict, will also likely face a civil lawsuit brought by Martin's parents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 16--LADY JUSTICE is often portrayed as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">blindfolded to show the law's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">objectivity and impartiality. But the statue carved in stone may be the only entity capable of impartiality in the case of George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most know the basics: On a rainy night in February 2012 in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., the two met. Mr. Martin, 17, ended up dead, shot by the neighborhood watch captain. After a six-week delay, Mr. Zimmerman was charged with murder. On Saturday, a jury of six women found him not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury had little choice. To prove second-degree murder, the prosecutor had to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr. Zimmerman acted with &quot;ill will, hatred, spite, or an evil intent.&quot; The prosecutor's improbable argument--that Mr. Zimmerman was an angry vigilante--lacked evidence. Mr. Zimmerman's story remained consistent over time, his wounds fit, a neighbor saw that he was on the ground as Mr. Martin appeared to pummel him, even the lead detective testified (for the prosecution!) that Mr. Zimmerman seemed to be telling the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reactions to the not-guilty verdict range from angry demonstrations to tacit agreement. Where some saw a racist vigilante, others saw a young thug. Social psychologist Christena Cleveland, pointing out our racial divide, writes, &quot;Blacks often perceive [these incidents] as outrageously unjust, oppressive, critically important, and indicative of deeply-rooted racial injustice in American society.&quot; Why? Because many have experienced racial profiling themselves. On the other hand, whites see incidents like this as &quot;isolated events that aren't necessarily related to larger societal issues&quot; and often &quot;the result of blacks engaging in 'race-baiting' or 'playing the race card.'&quot; Why? Because they haven't experienced profiling and because some who have built their careers on crying racism flock to the microphones and cheapen cries for justice. Black or white, our viewpoints tend to be myopic. Those who really long for peace among the races would do well to wear the others' glasses for a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial is ended but the case is not closed. The Martin family has lost a son and Mr. Zimmerman is no free man. He could face federal civil rights charges (allowable under the &quot;separate sovereigns&quot; doctrine) and/or a wrongful death civil suit from the Martin family. He certainly faces a lifetime of concern for his life. The Old Testament wisely provided cities of refuge as protection against avengers for those who unintentionally killed another. Mr. Zimmerman may wish that were still the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Lady Justice still stands, impassive and silent, her scales rightfully tipped a bit toward the defense, her double-edged sword at the ready, her blindfold secure. Mr. Zimmerman, let us remember, was not on trial for the institutional racism of Sanford, Fla., or the entire nation, however real that may be. He was charged in the death of one young man on a rainy February night. Would that both could now be at peace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a case that reeks of racial profiling, Zimmerman, 29, chose to ignore orders by police not to confront Martin, as the teenager was walking to his father's house in a gated community in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why was Zimmerman following Martin? Because he considered a black teenager holding a bag of Skittles and an iced tea &quot;suspicious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States had come so far in recent years toward eliminating racism and the unfair treatment of African Americans in their society that this represents a monumental, sad, admission that racism is still alive and well in a country that not 50 years ago, was still making blacks sit at the back of the bus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US President Barack Obama has appealed to Americans for restraint amid anger from civil rights activists and public protests against the acquittal of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury comprising six women -- reportedly five white and a hispanic -- late on Saturday found neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, after a long and racially-charged trial that transfixed much of the US for weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second-degree murder, having pursued Martin, 17, through a gated community in the town of Sanford, eventually shooting him during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial aroused strong passions and divided those who believed that Mr Zimmerman -- whose father is white and mother is Peruvian -- had racially-profiled Martin, and those who believed he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spontaneous protests broke out in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta overnight, following the verdict, although they were mostly peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, a large demonstration in New York attracted several thousand people, with placards that read, ``Jail racist killers, not black youth'', and ``We are all Trayvon. The whole damn system is guilty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr Obama, the first black US president, urged people to accept the trial verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,'' Mr Obama said in a statement. ``I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president tied the killing of the teenager to the problems surrounding gun use in the United States -- he had tried but failed to push through new control measures in the US congress earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this. As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honour Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,'' Mr Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Justice said on Sunday it continued to have an open investigation into the case, following the Florida trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction,'' it said in a statement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were always two conflicting narratives in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin murder case. In one version, Mr. Martin was an innocent child who was stalked, accosted and brutally gunned down by a self-styled, hate-filled vigilante. In the other, George Zimmerman was a conscientious citizen who was attacked and beaten by a young punk in a hoodie, and sought to defend himself. To both sides, the case was always black and white. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial, and the jury's verdict, changed nothing. The two sides are as polarized as ever. To some, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is a martyr, and the verdict is a licence to kill any black kid on the street. &quot;I live in a country that makes me wish my sons away, wish that they don't exist, because it's not safe,&quot; said Melissa Harris-Perry, a black commentator, on MSNBC. The Martin family's lawyer compared Trayvon to Medgar Evers and Emmett Till, civil-rights victims who were murdered by white vigilantes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other side insists that the real martyr is Mr. Zimmerman - even though he was acquitted. A &quot;sick show trial,&quot; one commentator called it. His lawyer told reporters: &quot;You took a story that was fed to you and you ran with it and you ran right over him.&quot; Some people predicted the verdict would provoke race riots, which (perhaps to their disappointment) did not materialize. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A generation after the triumph of the civil-rights movement, the prism of race still dominates discourse about politics, crime, class and justice in America. It is the ancient wound that never heals. And everybody loves to pick the scabs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tragic as it was, this case was a local criminal trial that was blown vastly out of proportion by racial politics. The stereotyping on both sides ran rampant. To the liberal media, it was a clear-cut case of racial profiling. Awkwardly, George Zimmerman turned out to be half Hispanic, a fact that, according to the racial categories that warp American society, makes him about as white as Barack Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conservative commentators did a racial number on Trayvon, too. They portrayed the unarmed teenager as a hulking, menacing adult - a pot-smoker, a thief, a gangsta in the making. Mr. Martin, being dead, wasn't able to defend himself. Juan Williams, a black commentator for Fox News, nailed it when he wrote, &quot;Whatever the final verdict on Zimmerman, the media is clearly guilty of playing on the most primitive racial divisions in our society to fuel racial animosity and boost ratings.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, the case was never black and white. And in the end, the evidence did not support a guilty verdict. The system worked - although whether Florida's gun laws work is another matter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately, the rhetoric from black leaders, who want the U.S. Justice Department to bring hate-crime charges against Mr. Zimmerman, comes from another era. America's backward-looking black leadership is peddling old grievances at a time when the black middle and lower classes face acute new challenges. Racial discrimination is not their biggest problem any more. The black middle class has been hit especially hard by the recession. The lower class is afflicted by miserable school achievement, sky-high incarceration rates and a rate of non-marital childbearing that has soared above 70 per cent. The greatest threat to young black males does not come from white people. It comes from other young black males, who shoot each other at alarming rates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No verdict in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case could change any of that. This case is not happy news for anyone - except, perhaps, the media, which has feasted on his corpse for months. America's race debates are toxic. But they sure do make for terrific ratings. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House says U.S. President Barack Obama will not involve himself in decisions by the Justice Department on whether to pursue civil rights charges against George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesperson Jay Carney says it would be inappropriate for Obama to express an opinion on how the department deals with Zimmerman after the neighbourhood watch volunteer's acquittal in the shooting of the unarmed 17-year-old last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of Saturday's verdict have called for the Justice Department to step in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department has said it is investigating whether federal criminal civil rights charges are warranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carney would not comment on Obama's view of Florida's &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; law, which gives people wide latitude to use deadly force if they fear death or bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, two days after George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a book agent Monday confirmed that one of the jurors who reached that verdict plans to write a book about the high-profile trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Literary and media manager Sharlene Martin said she has signed the juror, still publicly known only as B-37, the designation she was given during jury selection, and her husband to write a book describing her experience as a juror and explaining the controversial verdict she and the five other jurors reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My hope is that people will read Juror B37's book, written with her attorney husband, and understand the commitment it takes to serve and be sequestered on a jury in a highly publicized murder trial and how important, despite one's personal viewpoints, it is to follow the letter of the law,&quot; Martin said in a statement. &quot;It could open a whole new dialogue about laws that may need to be revised and revamped to suit a 21st century way of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reader will also learn why the jurors had no option but to find Zimmerman not guilty due to the manner in which he was charged and the content of the jury instructions,&quot; the statement says.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When in 1992 a California jury acquitted the four officers who beat Rodney King, the result was a race riot of a kind not seen since the late 1960s - followed by a federal civil-rights prosecution that convicted two of the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of George Zimmerman for killing Trayvon Martin hasn't produced rioting, but it has spawned a growing demand, led by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, for a federal trial to recharge Zimmerman with violating Martin's civil rights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laws have changed since 1992 to make bringing such a prosecution easier than it would once have been. Yet the likelihood of getting a conviction would be extremely small - and instead of placating people who feel aggrieved by the first trial, another failed prosecution might make race relations in America worse, not better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In years past, it would have been difficult if not impossible to bring a federal civil-rights charge against a private citizen such as Zimmerman who attacked another citizen on the street. Civil rights crimes then extended to government officials acting under colour of law, or to private citizens who injured other citizens who were engaged in a set of federally protected activities. These included going to school, registering to vote, or trying to make use of a public accommodation such as a lunch counter or soda fountain. The federal laws, in other words, were designed to cover the classic civil rights situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That changed in 2009, when Congress passed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. The law is often called the Matthew Shepard Act for short, and is best known for making it a crime to injure someone because of sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Byrd was an African-American murdered by white supremacists in Texas in 1998, and the law actually began by removing the requirement of a federally protected activity for racially motivated crimes. Under the act, bodily injury is a federal crime if &quot;committed because of the actual or perceived race, colour, religion, national origin of any person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the surface, this clearly phrased law would seem to make conviction relatively straightforward. All the prosecution would have to do is show that Zimmerman's attack on Martin was racially motivated. There is no need to prove that Martin was on a public street or that Zimmerman was trying to deprive him of a civil right. Passed pursuant to Congress's authority under the 13th Amendment to remove all incidents and badges of slavery, the law also doesn't require the prosecution to show any awkward link to Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet how, exactly, would the federal government prove Zimmerman's motivation? Testimony from a former co-worker who claims that Zimmerman made racist, anti-Arab comments on the job would likely not be admissible. Zimmerman's possible racial slur on the tape of his conversation with the 911 operator while following Martin might conceivably be admitted as probative. But a single phrase that is difficult to interpret on the tape is unlikely to be enough to convince a jury that Martin's race was the cause for the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if a jury accepted that Zimmerman suspected Martin and pursued him because of his race, the defence attorneys would argue that the actual shooting was motivated by self-defence, not race. And one jury already apparently bought some version of the self-defence story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could be argued, with some force, that the Justice Department should bring federal charges even if the odds of success are slim. The fact of a federal prosecution would show that the government takes hate crimes seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with scant chances of success, the fact of prosecution might vindicate federal interest in preserving the right of everyone to walk the streets without being attacked, regardless of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trouble would arise when another jury - as it probably would - acquitted Zimmerman. Instead of the bottom-line message being that the government wants to protect all its citizens from hate crimes, events might underscore that in 2013, a white- appearing American can still shoot an unarmed African-American teenager and get away with it not once but twice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One acquittal could perhaps be explained away by the vagaries of the jury system or the particularities of the culture of self-defence as symbolized by Florida's stand-your-ground law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second acquittal would mean something different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the charge would be that Zimmerman acted with racial animus, the verdict might be perceived as saying that the public didn't believe race was in issue here at all - or worse, that the public didn't care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights laws are made to be used, and there's no escaping that they have a symbolic value alongside their practical effects. If you believe that Zimmerman killed Martin because of his race, it's easy to understand the appeal of the civil rights charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question for advocates, then, is simple: Would you still support bringing charges even if you believed Zimmerman would get off again?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the NAACP, the answer may be yes. But for the government, the decision to prosecute must also take account of the odds of success. The consequences of failure here are serious. This time, prudence might counsel letting the coin flip of the Florida jury verdict - however outrageous - stand as the last word.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUARDIAN FEATURES PAGES; Pg. 2</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">414 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About the only thing that everyone agrees on is what Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was carrying when he died. There were his clothes, including a black hooded top with a badge pinned to it showing a picture of his dead cousin. There was his cellphone, on which he had been talking to a friend. In his pockets were a cigarette lighter, some earphones, a can of Arizona watermelon fruit juice cocktail, a little over $40 in cash, a bag of Skittles he'd just bought from a nearby 7-Eleven, and no weapon of any kind. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether or not you believe George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood-watch co-ordinator who says he shot Martin in self-defence, these don't sound like instruments of burglary. Indeed, the Skittles especially, with their bright playground colours and &quot;Taste the Rainbow&quot; slogan, have become a symbol of Martin's innocence. He may have been suspended from school at the time, and had traces of cannabis in his blood, but when you look behind the appearance of a menacing black teenager, those Skittles say, you find the child inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the killing, as pressure grew for Zimmerman to face a murder charge, and now in the outrage over his acquittal, bags of Skittles have become the protesters' flag. They have been waved, hung round necks, taped over mouths and even glued to placards, often combined with hoodies and sweet drinks. Packets were bought and sold to raise campaign funds, or posted to Bill Lee, chief of the Sanford police department, which declined to charge Zimmerman for so long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, Skittles are now a point of attack for those who believe that Martin was one of those rare unarmed 17-year-olds who can be dangerous enough to merit killing. The Skittles and the drink he bought, some have suggested, could have been ingredients to make lean (AKA sizzurp or purple drank), a homemade drug based on cough medicine that might cause aggressive and irrational behaviour if overused. (The fact that Sprite and Jolly Ranchers are more usual, and that Martin didn't have any cough medicine, are also worth considering.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wrigley Company, which makes Skittles, has kept wisely quiet about the uncomfortable but lucrative position that it finds itself in, saying only that it would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; to get involved. Zimmerman's 9mm Kel-Tec handgun will now be returned to him. But when the Seminole County criminal justice centre has finished with Martin's still-unopened bag of Skittles, it belongs in a museum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I deliberately watched none of the Zimmerman trial, just as I have deliberately not read a draft of a new book by Jen Marlowe, soon to be published: I Am Troy Davis, about a young black man in Georgia who was, by all indications, innocent of any crime - but was put to death recently by the state. News of these deaths, of Troy, of Trayvon, is so painful that I protect myself in this way. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So many killings of black men in my lifetime. The physical shock is astounding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I write this, remembering that when Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated in 1968, the shock to my system was so severe I lost the child I was carrying. This shock, this assault on the psyche and body, is what is intended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, too, is painful, though we may feel glad not to be, ourselves, so cruel and sadistic. I feel the grief of all people who love fairness and justice coursing through my body, deep into my soul. We are united in our suffering. Being aware of this helps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contemplating Zimmerman's exoneration for the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in a letter to a friend on Sunday, I wrote this, with a few thoughts added yesterday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just heard the Zimmerman verdict. It makes me think of the man given the 'pleasure' of assassinating Che Guevara. He was young, and it was his birthday. He was strutting and proud to be offered this 'work', as Che stood bleeding, weakened and alone, before him. Fast forward to recently, when the assassin became old and ill and needed surgery - and Cuban doctors (who loved Che Guevara) did their best to heal him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ache of realisation, of what he has done, when it comes for Zimmerman, will be all the punishment he will ever deserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember now, with understanding, that our parents used to say, about things they regretted they had done and that they got away with: 'I'd rather take a whipping . . .'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zimmerman will wish many times in his life that they had given him 100 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration was last night facing intense pressure to bring a federal prosecution against George Zimmerman, acquitted of murdering the unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, as activists called for a day of action to protest against the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Holder, the US attorney general, said on Monday that he shared concerns about Trayvon's &quot;tragic, unnecessary death&quot;, and promised that the department of justice would renew the federal investigation that it launched last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reverend Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader, said vigils would be held in at least 100 cities on Saturday. Zimmerman, meanwhile, could be back in court within a year if Trayvon's parents follow through with their intention to file a civil suit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was found not guilty of second-degree murder when the jury accepted that he killed Trayvon in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Martin family, said he would discuss the proposed action with them in the coming days as they absorbed Saturday's decision by the criminal court jury to acquit the neighbourhood watch leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder said in a speech to Delta Sigma Theta, the largest African American sorority, that the department of justice would look carefully at the case. &quot;The justice department shares your concern - I share your concern - and, as we first acknowledged last spring, we have opened an investigation into the matter,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are resolved, as you are, to combat violence involving or directed at young people, to prevent future tragedies and to deal with underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs and stereotypes that serve as the basis for these too common incidents. We will never stop working to ensure that - in every case, in every circumstance, in every community - justice must be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal has placed Holder, the first African American attorney general, and Barack Obama, the first mixed-race president, in a difficult position. Civil rights campaigners are clamouring for a federal trial following Saturday's acquittal, but the not guilty verdict has undermined the chances of a federal prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Zimmerman is to face new charges under federal law, they would almost certainly be under the Hate Crimes Prevention Act that was enacted by the Obama administration in 2009. Federal prosecutors would need to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, wilfully inflicted bodily injury because Trayvon was black. If found guilty, he could face life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Holder is likely to review a case as high-profile as this, the investigation will be led by the assistant attorney general for civil rights, Thomas Perez. Former justice department officials expressed doubt about the success of a federal prosecution yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Racially motivated cases are very difficult because you need to establish the state of mind of the perpetrator at the time he committed the crime,&quot; said William Yeomans, who was acting assistant attorney general in 2001. &quot;It would require showing that George Zimmerman was motivated by race in this instance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeomans, who was also a chief of staff in the justice department and is now a law professor in Washington, said government prosecutors would have &quot;a very difficult hurdle&quot; to overcome. The department has also traditionally been cautious when bringing federal charges in cases that have already been tried at state level, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder may address the issue in more detail in a speech about gun crime and race in Florida today, less than 40 miles from where Trayvon was shot dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder is speaking at an event in Orlando organised by the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, which has expressed outrage at the acquittal of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's family were considering their options in the light of Saturday's verdict. Under Florida's statute of limitations, a civil suit for wrongful death must be filed before the second anniversary of Trayvon's death, on 26 February next year. It carries a far lower burden of proof than the criminal charge but faces the significant hurdle of the state's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which allows for the use of deadly force if a person fears for their life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jasmine Rand, another lawyer representing Trayvon's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, said yesterday that they had not yet made a final decision. &quot;I believe they will pursue it but it's up to them. There are much larger issues at hand such as making sure this doesn't happen again,&quot; she said. &quot;They are heartbroken by the verdict but at the same time inspired by all the love and support they have received from within the nation and worldwide, and by President Obama's inspiring words yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama issued a statement calling on Americans &quot;to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son&quot; and urging citizens to &quot;widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark O'Mara, Zimmerman's lead defence lawyer, said: &quot;If someone believes it's appropriate to sue George Zimmerman, then we will seek and we will get immunity in a civil hearing and we'll see just how many lawsuits are spawned from this fiasco. We're not quite done yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's wife Shellie is likely to be the next to face court as the Florida state attorney's office pursues a charge of perjury. Prosecutors claim she lied to the court at her husband's bail hearing when she said the couple were virtually penniless, despite having collected more than $150,000 in public donations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also at Wireless, A Tribe Called Quest dedicated their set to Trayvon. &quot;I don't want to be a downer but yesterday, in America, we saw a miscarriage of justice,&quot; Q-Tip said on Sunday. &quot;It's not the first time this has happened. Pray for us . . . we need help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other musicians responded on Twitter to the verdict. &quot;Shit (don't) change, and I may never get to see it do so. I pray 4my kids &amp; yours,&quot; wrote Lil Wayne. &quot;Bullshit!&quot; tweeted Chris Brown. Rihanna called it &quot;the saddest news ever&quot;, while Miley Cyrus said she felt &quot;sick&quot;. &quot;Black parents hug your sons right tonight. Let them know their value. This ain't a black or white thing this is a wrong and right thing,&quot; wrote Talib Kweli, while Solange Knowles suggested: &quot;We have to somehow turn this anger &amp; pain into peaceful productivity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are uncanny echoes of the politics of Stephen Lawrence case in the acquittal on Saturday in Florida of George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer who shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed teenager, having assumed him to be a criminal. It took 44 days after Martin's death and a national campaign in the US for Zimmerman to be arrested. In that time, evidence was lost as the Florida police insisted that the state's law on self-defence barred them from bringing charges. The prosecutors said the case was not about race. Before the trial began, Judge Deborah Nelson forbade the use of the term &quot;racial profiling&quot; in the courtroom, and yet, without the element of race, Martin might still be alive today. Zimmerman's pursuit of and confrontation with him was premised on the assumption that the very presence of a black teenager in a gated community was sufficient cause for alarm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the Lawrence case, the Martin trial has attracted national scrutiny, not always helpful to the cause of justice. Barack Obama said before the trial that if he had a son, he would look like Trayvon. On Sunday, the president said the acquittal should be met with calm reflection, and reminded Americans that theirs was a nation of laws. Put those two comments together, and the limits of presidential empathy in the face of acquittal become evident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question this case poses is: whose laws? Try as commentators might to tiptoe around the fact, the size of the frame in which these cases are judged is enormous. The jury decided that the evidence did not exist to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Martin was an innocent victim, but that does little to discharge the police and prosecutor of their responsibility for finding and presenting that evidence. Whether justice stooped as low in this case as it did in Alabama in 1965, when Jimmie Lee Jackson, an army veteran on a march in support of a voter-registration drive was shot twice in the stomach by a state trooper, is doubtful. Yet although the racial dynamics may have changed from the days of the civil rights movement - the teenager's assailant was a Latino - the message an acquittal sends out to African American parents is familiar: there are few places after dark where your sons are safe, either from the police or from the colour of the law. If someone like Zimmerman assumes your son is a threat, the risk is it's open season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police commissioners claim that tough stop-and-frisk policies clean up the streets, even though no such effect can be definitively established in New York or elsewhere. What matters now is to deal with the damage the verdict has done. As the Lawrence case has shown, the verdict and justice remain miles apart, sending out devastating messages that cannot be ignored.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woman named only as juror B37 abandons plans to write book as NAACP steps up pressure on DoJ to launch federal prosecution <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An angry backlash has forced a juror in the George Zimmerman murder case to abandon plans to write a book about her experience, as activists at the biggest civil rights group in the US tore up the agenda at their annual convention on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York publishing house Martin Literary Management issued a statement declaring it had rescinded its offer of co-operation to the middle-aged woman,known only as juror B37, &quot;after careful consideration&quot; in response to thousands of critical messages on social media. The woman gave a television interview on Monday night in which she revealed that the jury was initially split over Zimmerman's guilt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Orlando, Florida, less than 30 miles from where Martin was killed last year, delegates at the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) stepped up their pressure on the Obama administration to launch a federal prosecution against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former officials from the DoJ have been playing down the chances of new charges, which would require a prosecutors to prove that Zimmerman was motivated by race when he confronted and the fatally shot the teenager in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the attorney general, Eric Holder, raised hopes about the prospects of a fresh prosecution on Monday, when he said that he shared concerns about the &quot;tragic, unnecessary death&quot; of Martin, who was shot dead by Zimmerman as he walked home from a convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder was due to address the NAACP convention on Tuesday. Benjamin Jealous, the president of the NAACP, said he was hopeful that Holder would address the organisation's demand for a federal trial. &quot;What matters here are the facts and the legal standard. We believe there are enough facts to meet the legal standard, and that the US Justice Department should bring criminal civil rights charges,&quot; Jealous told the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any decision is likely to take months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests continued around the US in the wake of the verdict, with 14 arrests at demonstrations that turned violent in Los Angeles late on Monday. In New York, demonstrators chanted: &quot;Trayvon dead, Zimmerman free, this is not democracy,&quot; and carried provocative banners that read: &quot;Trayvon was lynched&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile juror B37 appeared to express regret for pursuing a book deal. The woman, one of the six female jurors who on Saturday acquitted Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch leader, released a statement acknowledging the &quot;depth of pain that exists among the general public over every aspect of this case&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman said she had only realised the sensitivities surrounding the three-week trial, during which the jury was sequestered, after returning home. She said she now realised that writing the book, which she intended as &quot;a respectful observation of the trial from my and my husband's perspectives&quot; was no longer the direction in which she wanted to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With her face blacked out, she appeared in a television interview on Monday night, revealing that only three members of the six-woman panel had initially voted to acquit Zimmerman. Two thought he was guilty of manslaughter, and one believed he was guilty of the original charge, second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman said that she and fellow jurors believed that Martin threw the first punch in the fatal confrontation, leaving Zimmerman in fear of his life. That, she said, was the determining factor in why the three changed their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She insisted that justice had been served. &quot;George Zimmerman is a man whose heart was in the right place, but just got displaced by the vandalism in the neighbourhood ... he wanted to catch these people so badly that he went above and beyond what he really should have done,&quot; she told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It just went terribly wrong,&quot; she said. &quot;Things just got out of hand. I think he's guilty of not using good judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel deliberated for more than 16 hours before all of them accepted that Zimmerman acted in self-defence, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jealous said Holder would get a warm welcome at the NAACP convention in Florida. &quot;Holder always gets a hero's reception at the NAACP, because he has done a great job rebuilding the civil rights division of the Justice Department, which was virtually dismantled by George W Bush,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eric Holder is often candid when he comes to speak to us. We expect he will make honest comments about the state of civil rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions in the wake of the verdict were apparent particularly in Los Angeles, where protesters ran through streets Monday night, breaking windows, attacking people on sidewalks and raiding a Walmart store, while others blocked a major freeway in the San Francisco Bay area in the third night of demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourteen people were arrested after multiple acts of vandalism and several assaults in Los Angeles' Crenshaw district, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The trial that we saw in Florida has ignited passions but we have to make sure that it will not ignite the city,&quot; Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, California, at least one person was injured and police made nine arrests when a protest turned violent Monday night.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney general tells NAACP convention that such laws 'try to fix something that was never broken' and calls for wider debate <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Holder, the US attorney general, launched an attack Tuesday on self-defence laws he said encouraged more violence, and used George Zimmerman's acquittal over the murder of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as a backdrop to call for a deeper debate about issues of race and gun controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Orlando, Florida, close to the town of Sanford where Martin was killed in February last year, Holder insisted it was time to look again at legislation such as the state's stand-your-ground law that eliminated &quot;the commonsense and age-old requirement&quot; that people who felt threatened had a duty to retreat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These laws try to fix something that was never broken,&quot; he said. &quot;We must stand our ground to ensure that our laws reduce violence and take a hard look at laws that contribute to more violence than they prevent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By allowing and perhaps encouraging violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety. The list of resulting tragedies is long and unfortunately has victimised too many who are innocent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech by Holder, the country's first African American attorney general, was warmly received by members of the NAACP, who have been vocal since Zimmerman's controversial murder acquittal on Saturday in their demands for the neighbourhood watch leader to face a federal civil rights prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder repeated his promise that Martin's &quot;tragic and unnecessary&quot; death would be fully investigated by the Department of Justice as it determined whether legal action could be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NAACP and its members are deeply and rightly concerned about this case, as passionate civil rights leaders, engaged citizens and most of all as parents,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Justice will consider all available information before determining what action to take. But independent of the legal determination, I believe this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly and openly about the complicated and emotionally-charged issues that this case has raised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recalling stories from his own childhood, he spoke of the progress that still needed to be made in race relations in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Years ago, some of these same issues drove my father to sit down with me, to have a conversation about how, as a young black man, I should interact with the police, what to say and how to conduct myself, if I was ever stopped or confronted in a way I thought was unwarranted,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure my father felt certain at that time that my parents' generation would be the last to have to worry about such things for their children. Since those days our country has indeed changed for the better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yet for all the progress we have seen, recent events demonstrate that we still have much more work to do and much further to go. The news of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death last year and the discussions that have taken place since then reminded me of my father's words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder said he had spoken with his own 15-year-old son, &quot;not to burden him with the baggage of eras long gone, but to make him aware of the world he must still confront.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a sad reality in a nation changing for the better in so many ways,&quot; Holder added. &quot;I am determined to ensure that the kind of talk I had with my son isn't the only conversation we engage in as a result of these tragic events.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He addressed the protests that followed Zimmerman's acquittal, which, apart from a small number of arrests in California, were largely peaceful. &quot;In the days leading up to the weekend's verdict, some predicted and prepared for riots and waves of civil unrest across the country. Some feared that the anger of those who disagreed with the jury might overshadow and obscure the issues,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people of Sanford and for most part thousands of others across America, rejected this destructive path. They proved wrong those who doubted their commitment to the rule of law and across America diverse groups of citizens are instead overwhelmingly making their voices heard through rallies and vigils designed to provoke responsible debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who act in a contrary manner do not honour the memory of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Holder said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emmett Till was a 14-year-old black boy from Chicago who was holidaying with relatives in Mississippi when he made two big mistakes. He went into a local grocery store patronised and owned by whites; worse, he eyed up the young woman behind the  counter. For this &quot;crime&quot; the woman's husband and his brother hunted Emmett down, beat him senseless, gouged out his eyes and then dumped the corpse in the Tallahatchie River.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This being the Deep South in the 1950s, the two men were acquitted of the murder, though both confessed to it later, when they were protected by &quot;double jeopardy&quot; legislation.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only good thing in this dreadful tale was that the dead boy's mother, back in Chicago, was a strong and determined woman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She turned the funeral, when the hideously disfigured body was eventually returned to Chicago, into a major national event, one that had enormous resonance in the developing civil rights narrative. Crucially, she insisted that the coffin be  left open so that the almost unbelievable brutality of the murder was exposed for  all to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Dylan wrote a simple, eloquent song about the boy's death some years later, and much more recently Emmylou Harris wrote a tender, heart-breaking song about the murder which she signs with a restrained poignancy. Both songs end on gently upbeat, restorative notes: Dylan sings of a greater place to live, Harris of the hope of  a kinder world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such hopes now appear to be mere dreams as far as the south of the US in concerned, despite the election - not once but twice - of a black, left-leaning President and despite several generations of civil rights agitation and achievement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was believed by many civil rights leaders that the terrible death had been such a stain on the nation's collective conscience that it would lead to significant change. Now we must have second thoughts on that, as a jury has just acquitted  George Zimmerman of murdering a  black male teenager, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,  in Sanford, Florida. Mr Trayvon had  no criminal record. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman had been charged with second degree murder. He was a volunteer in the local Neighbourhood Watch and known locally as something of &quot;a wanabee cop&quot;. His mindset appears to have been that of an over-zealous vigilante. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict clearly implied that Mr Zimmerman must have acted in self defence, despite the fact that Mr Trayvon was unarmed. Mr Zimmermann had called the real cops when he spotted Mr Trayvon, wearing a hoodie, and looking &quot;suspicious&quot;. The police told him to wait for officers to arrive. Mr Zimmerman's response was apparently on the lines of &quot;f****** punks - these assholes always get away&quot;. So he took the law into his own hands and shot Mr Trayvon dead.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then Florida has a so-called &quot;stand your ground&quot; law which essentially allows anyone who considers themselves to be in danger to take any action they deem necessary to protect themselves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that context, it seems utterly logical that Mr Zimmerman was acquitted, despite the fact that as the Florida prosecutor Bernie De La Rionda said: &quot;A teenager  is dead through no fault of his own - he's dead because another man made an assumption.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wider context - that of a nation which thought it had achieved at least some progress in civil rights since Emmett Till's harrowing death, and which is currently in the midst of a deep and painful debate about the casual and irresponsible use of guns - the acquittal of Mr Zimmerman seems appalling. Indeed it looks very like a throwback to the evil times when the Ku Klux Klan held sway in several southern states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So when will America finally wake up and realise that &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws are indefensible? And that firearms can be easily, even glibly, obtained - and are far  too often found in the wrong hands?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many, perhaps most, Americans have believed for two or three generations that Emmett Till did not die in vain. Now, with Mr Zimmerman walking free, you have  to wonder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin was tragic and unnecessary, and ought to spark public debate about how to prevent similar incidents, US Attorney General Eric Holder said yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first comments since a state jury acquitted George Zimmerman on Saturday in the February 2012 shooting case, Holder said federal prosecutors were continuing to investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues this case has raised,&quot; Mr Holder told a convention of Delta Sigma Theta, a black sorority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mr Zimmerman was cleared of murder charges under Florida law, US prosecutors could decide to bring criminal charges under a federal hate-crimes law, and some civil rights advocates are lobbying prosecutors to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hate-crimes law would require the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt Mr Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, shot Mr Martin, who was black, because of race. Prosecutors would decide what to do based on the facts of the case and the law, Mr Holder said. The chief US prosecutor  said the Justice Department shared concerns about the case, and said he wanted to counter the &quot;mistaken beliefs and stereotypes that serve as the basis for these too common incidents.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durham pastor John Leak was outspoken Sunday in his reaction to the not-guilty verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman for the death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's really a shame that for centuries this country has perpetuated philosophies that flow throughout the system to disenfranchise and even destroy young African-American male lives,&quot; he said at an impromptu rally in downtown Durham. &quot;This is just another story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Americans, black and white, echoed Leak's frustrations Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many others - even more than a few who decried the death of an unarmed young black man at the hands of an overzealous neighborhood watch volunteer - welcomed or at least acknowledged that the justice system had worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the details of the altercation between Martin and Zimmerman that led to the fatal shot, whatever Zimmerman's motivations and prejudices, the six-woman jury felt and most legal observers agreed that the state failed to prove manslaughter, much less murder, beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial and verdict, like the shooting itself, have evoked a range of emotions in no small part because the case has provoked yet another in our seemingly unending debate over race in modern America. It is seemingly unending, of course, because questions of race and prejudice are so deeply embedded in a history of a country that, founded on the premise that &quot;all men are created equal,&quot; nonetheless first enslaved and then repressed African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as protesters were gathering here and around the nation to react to the verdict, a University of Florida professor was recalling for an audience at the Durham County Public Library signs that through the mid-20th century often warned &quot;No dogs, negroes, Mexicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you focus on African-American and Latin American histories, it's not a story of progress or how we're gaining more equality from decade to decade,&quot; Paul Ortiz in his presentation on the history of Jim Crow/Juan Crow, the system of systematic and legal discrimination that characterized the South for a century after Reconstruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A generation is hardly enough time to erase the memory and the scars from all those years of mistreatment. So it's no surprise that many people, black and white, viewed Martin's death as another example of the marginalization of young black males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martin case became, as these cases often do, a peg on which people of widely varying opinions could hang their world perspectives and their ideology. But it was, as these cases often are, a terribly imperfect vehicle for the larger conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We correctly have established a justice system where the burden of proof is a heavy one (although, in keeping with our complex narrative on this subject, many feel that even now that burden is lighter when African-American men are in the dock).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trials, for better or worse, are not morality plays,&quot; Michael Band, a Florida defense lawyer not affiliated with the case, told The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll continue to watch and perform in that morality play on many different stages, however.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House said Monday that President Obama will not be a part of the Justice Department's deliberations over whether to pursue federal hate crime charges against George Zimmerman, distancing itself from a decision fraught with the potential for political fallout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric Holder offered no signal Monday about whether the department was leaning toward pursuing a case against Zimmerman, the Florida man found not guilty over the weekend of murdering Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder said in separate remarks that the death of the Florida teenager was &quot;unnecessary&quot; and &quot;tragic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But legal experts and former DOJ officials said they doubt the administration will bring the case, given the difficulty in proving that Zimmerman was motivated by race when he shot Martin, who was black, during a confrontation in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will have to do some pretty tortuous legal reasoning to get to a point where they can bring a case here,&quot; said Mark Corallo, who served as public affairs director for the DOJ under former Attorney General John Ashcroft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Zimmerman was acquitted. There was very little evidence brought forward in the case that pointed to any racial motive whatsoever. I don't think they're going to want to go there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder and Obama face a difficult political decision as well. Much of the president's base has been voicing outrage over the verdict, pushing hard for the Justice Department to open a federal case against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury on Saturday found Zimmerman not guilty of manslaughter and second-degree murder charges, accepting the accused's claim he was defending himself against Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday the DOJ, in concert with the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Florida, said it was weighing the evidence against Zimmerman and the state trial record to determine if Martin's civil rights were violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DOJ began investigating Martin's killing last year but put the case on hold when state prosecutors opened their criminal case against Zimmerman. The FBI also investigated the slaying, interviewing more than 30 people, only to resolve that race did not appear to be a motivating factor for Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the DOJ does decide to pursue civil rights charges, it would escalate the already high-profile case and put the administration at its center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if it decides not to bring a case against Zimmerman, the political and public opinion fallout could be dire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic strategist Cornell Belcher warned there could be serious repercussions for establishment Democrats if they attempt to ignore or marginalize Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The base of the Democratic Party and the base of the country today is brown people,&quot; said Belcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no majority Democratic coalition without brown people as their base ... and I don't think you can look at the suffering the base of the progressive movement is going through right now and not expect some sort of mobilization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOJ investigators and prosecutors are in the throes of deciding whether to bring the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they decline to recommend that the DOJ move on it, Deputy Attorney General James Cole, or Holder himself, could reject the advice and file charges on behalf of the department.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the danger for the administration is that the investigators and prosecutors could then leak their findings to the media with strong suggestions that political motivations lay behind the decision to pursue the matter, according to two former high-ranking DOJ officials who agreed to speak on background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political pressure from within the party is steadily building, as many Democrats have expressed their support for a DOJ review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said the case &quot;isn't over with.&quot; And Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) wrote to Holder on Monday, backing the department's move to open its review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I respect the fact that the jury has spoken in the State of Florida v. George Zimmerman case, but I don't think this should be the last word,&quot; said Boxer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of press time on Monday, the nation's most prominent civil rights group, the NAACP, said it had received more than 270,000 signatures on a petition pushing Holder to act. The group said that it had spoken with top officials at the department about the review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of the DOJ's ultimate decision, which is expected within the coming months, Belcher said that Obama will have to address the case in a more significant way in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president is going to speak on it because every reporter in the country is going to ask him a question about it, so it's not something he's going to be able to avoid,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corallo said that if the DOJ decides not to take up the case, it is fortunate that the president is a Democrat. He argued the facts of the case will be allowed to speak for themselves &macr; without political rivals blaming one another for politicizing the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a country I think we can be grateful for the fact that we have a Democratic administration and the political leadership of the Justice Department is Democratic, and so there won't be any charges of Republicans snuffing a civil rights case,&quot; said Corallo.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FROM New York to California, outrage over the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager has poured from street demonstrations and church pulpits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters called for justice for the victim and demanded federal civil rights charges against the neighbourhood watch volunteer who killed him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida case has unleashed a national debate over racial profiling, self-defence and equal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, the Justice Department said it was looking into the case to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman has been acquitted in the state case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, the Justice Department said the criminal section of its civil rights division, the FBI and the US Attorney's office for the Middle District of Florida were evaluating evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama called the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin a tragedy for the country and urged calm reflection, a message shared by religious and civil rights leaders hoping to ensure peaceful demonstrations in the wake of a case that became an emotional flash point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Manhattan, congregants at Middle Collegiate Church were encouraged to wear hooded sweatshirts in memory of Martin, who was wearing a hoodie the night he was shot to death in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Reverend Jacqueline Lewis urged peace and told her congregation that slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr ``would have wanted us to conduct ourselves on the highest plane of dignity''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she added: ``We're going to raise our voices against the root causes of this kind of tragedy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders, including Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, urged peace in the wake of the verdict. Jackson said the legal system ``failed justice'', but violence wasn't the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not all the protesters heeded those calls. In Oakland, California, some angry demonstrators broke windows, burned US flags and started street fires. Some marchers also vandalised a police squad car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most protests were peaceful, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Manhattan's Union Square, hundreds of people gathered to voice their passions over the verdict while holding images of Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some tempered their anger, saying they didn't contest the jury's decision based on the legal issues involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ``while the verdict may be legal, a system that doesn't take into account what happened is a broken legal system'', Harlem resident Jennifer Lue said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Everyone should feel about this, whether you're Asian-American or African-American,'' she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interview came two days after the jury acquitted Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch volunteer, of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Martin in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. Martin was black, and Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic. Zimmerman was not arrested for 44 days, and the delay in charging him led to protests from those who believed race was a factor in the handling of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While prosecutors accused Zimmerman of profiling Martin, Zimmerman maintained he acted in self-defense. He claimed Martin was slamming his head into the concrete sidewalk when he fired the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the CNN interview, Juror B37 said she didn't believe that Zimmerman followed Martin because of his race. She said Zimmerman made some mistakes, but that she believed Martin struck Zimmerman first and that the neighborhood watch volunteer had a right to defend himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 said the jurors were initially divided on Zimmerman's guilt, with three jurors believing he was guilty of either manslaughter or second-degree murder, but that the jury agreed to acquit the 29-year-old Zimmerman after more closely reviewing the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a part of the interview that aired Tuesday, Juror B37 said it wouldn't have made much difference if Zimmerman had testified at trial since she believes he would have given the same story he gave investigators in videotaped police interviews that were played at the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 said at one point it appeared they might be heading toward a hung jury, as another juror wanted to leave. The other jurors convinced her to stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 said a block of concrete that defense attorney Mark O'Mara placed in front of jurors during closing arguments made an impression, as did photos of Zimmerman's bloodied head. She also believed Martin's actions contributed to his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think George got in a little bit too deep, which he shouldn't have been there, but Trayvon decided that he wasn't going to let him scare him and get the one-over, up on him or something,&quot; she said. &quot;I think Trayvon got mad and attacked him. &quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every now and then, America generates the perfect media storm. The death of Trayvon Martin was one such, featuring just about every hot-button law-and-order issue: guns and neighbourhood vigilantes, self-defence and the right to carry concealed weapons. And of course, permeating everything, race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race was barely mentioned during the month-long trial, but it hung over proceedings like a poisonous vapour. History is likely to add the Martin case to a long line stretching from the pre-civil-rights-era show trials of blacks subjected to Jim Crow justice, through to the acquittal of the Los Angeles police officers in the beating of black motorist Rodney King in 1992, and the ultimate media circus of the OJ trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difference is that, unlike in the parodies of justice in the segregated South where blacks were automatically convicted if accused of a crime against a white, this time the strictly legal outcome - the acquittal of Zimmerman by his peers - feels right. The law has not been an ass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case will surely not have the same impact on race relations in the US as the Rodney King case did, still less the 1968 murder of Martin Luther King, when cities went up in flames. Yes, there has been heated rhetoric, claims that the bad old days were never truly banished. But the protests in the 24 hours after the verdict - heartfelt yet almost entirely peaceful - surely tell a more accurate story.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Justice Department has announced that it will reopen its own investigation into George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer who shot dead an unarmed teenager in Florida in February 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal inquiry, which had been suspended pending the criminal trial, will look into whether Mr Zimmerman, 29, pictured, can be prosecuted on hate-crime charges. Civil rights leaders said they still believe the shooting occurred in part because its victim, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of peaceful demonstrators joined a rally that began in New York's Union Square on Sunday afternoon and later flooded into Times Square, remaining there until late into the night. Meanwhile, protests on the West Coast, in Los Angeles and San Francisco, were dispersed by police firing beanbag rounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They followed a series of impromptu demonstrations in cities across the US on Saturday night.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that George Zimmerman has been cleared of all charges in the killing of the Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, he intends to reclaim the gun he used to shoot dead the unarmed 17-year-old. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, Mr Zimmerman needs a firearm to protect himself now &quot;even more&quot; than before. Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Mr O'Mara said Mr Zimmerman, 29, &quot;feels, truly in his heart, that if he did not have that weapon [on the night of the shooting] he might not be here&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the heart of Mr Zimmerman's defence was Florida's so-called &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which allowed him not only to carry that gun and to use it, but also to escape being charged by the authorities until six weeks after the killing - and only then due to a public outcry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, which supposedly protects citizens who kill in self-defence, was created not at the behest of concerned Florida citizens, but by the gun lobby: the National Rifle Association (NRA); a powerful right-wing policy group called the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC); and a handful of pliant politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Robert Spitzer, a political scientist and author of several books on the NRA, says: &quot;The real culprit in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case was not Zimmerman, but Stand Your Ground. It's why the police did not investigate aggressively; it's why it took six weeks to bring charges against Zimmerman; and it's why his self-defence claim was extremely difficult to overcome. Stand Your Ground makes not only prosecution, but even mere investigation, very difficult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, the burden is on police and prosecutors to prove that a selfdefence claim is false - often a near-impossible task.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every now and then, America generates the perfect media storm. The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was one such, featuring just about every hot-button law and order issue you could imagine: guns and neighbourhood vigilantes, self-defence and the right to carry concealed weapons. And of course, permeating everything, race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out loud, race was barely mentioned during the month-long trial, but it hung over proceedings like a poisonous vapour. History is likely to add the Martin case to a long line stretching from the pre-civil rights era show trials of blacks subjected to Jim Crow justice, through to the acquittal of the Los Angeles police officers in the beating of black motorist Rodney King in 1992, and the ultimate media circus of the OJ Simpson trial two years later. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if the topic of race was not explicitly raised, that was because no one needed to be reminded that had Trayvon&nbsp;Martin been white, his fatal confrontation with George Zimmerman might never have happened. And, of course, had the six-person jury been all-black instead of all-white, the verdict might well have been different. But not necessarily. The difference is that, unlike in the parodies of justice in the segregated South where blacks were automatically convicted if accused of a crime against a white, or in the King and Simpson cases, this time the strictly legal outcome - the acquittal of Zimmerman by his peers - feels right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about the spirit of the law, one may ask, as opposed to its letter? Trials though are not morality plays; those who seek such catharsis should go to the theatre, not to a courtroom. On this occasion the law has not been an ass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well before Saturday evening's verdict, impartial expert opinion leant to the view that even if Florida's permissive self-defence laws were removed from the equation, the case for second-degree murder - requiring proof that even if the crime was not premeditated, Mr Zimmerman had displayed evil intent and hatred when he shot Mr Martin - simply was not being made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the judge allowed the prosecution to seek conviction on the lesser charge of manslaughter. But the jury threw that out too. The plain truth is that no one can say for sure what happened on that rainy Sunday evening of 26 February 2012 in the gated community of Sanford, Florida. There were no eyewitnesses, and it was never established whose voice, whether Zimmerman's or Martin's, was screaming for help in the background of the call to the emergency services. In a criminal court, a defendant's guilt must be shown &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;. Prosecutors failed to clear that fundamental hurdle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given America's multi-tiered legal system, this may not be the end of the affair. Under the criminal law of Florida, Zimmerman has been acquitted. But the Justice Department in Washington faces intense pressure from civil rights groups to bring federal charges against him, under existing hate-crime legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also possible that the Martin family could seek monetary redress for the loss of their son in civil court, where evidentiary standards are much lower. That indeed occurred in the Simpson case. This time, however, there has been no similar travesty of justice, and either course - whether civil or federal - would smack of double jeopardy. &quot;The jury has spoken,&quot; President Obama said at the weekend, as he urged calm. And, he could have added, one jury is enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it is, and despite the acquittal, George Zimmerman's life has probably been changed for ever. He is currently in hiding, a marked man who is now a target for a hothead's vigilante justice - what he was accused of meting out to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. He will, it appears, get his gun back, and as his lawyer Mark O'Mara drily noted: &quot;There's even more reason now, isn't there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, this case will surely not have the same impact on race relations in the US as the Rodney King case did, still less the 1968 murder of Martin Luther King, when entire cities went up in flames. Yes, there has been heated rhetoric, claims that the bad old days were never truly banished. But the protests and demonstrations in the 24 hours after the verdict was handed down - heartfelt yet almost entirely peaceful - surely tell a more accurate story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin has proved that race is still a factor in national life - but name one country on earth which has a significant racial minority where it is not a factor. Beyond doubt race relations in the US have greatly improved. But there is still much to be done. If it is nonsense to argue that Zimmerman's acquittal proves that the &quot;New South&quot; is as bad as the bigoted old one, it is equally absurd to pretend that, even after the election of a black president, the US has advanced to sunlit, post-racial uplands. &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama remarked when the case first hit the headlines, 15 months ago. The worries of minority parents about how their children will be treated by a society whose institutions were forged and still mostly run by whites, persist even now, half a century after America's civil rights revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And one final, depressing thought. If the US had sensible gun laws, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would not have died, and no one would have heard of George Zimmerman. Alas, even if you got rid of race in America, you'd never get rid of guns.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, which supposedly protects citizens who kill in self-defence, was created not at the behest of concerned Florida citizens, but by the gun lobby, the National Rifle Association (NRA), a powerful right-wing policy group called the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), and a handful of pliant politicians. Since it was introduced in Florida in 2005, it has spread to 24 more US states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Robert Spitzer, a political scientist and author of several books on the NRA, says: &quot;The real culprit in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case was not Zimmerman but Stand Your Ground. It's why the police did not investigate aggressively, it's why it took six weeks to bring charges against Zimmerman, and it's why his self-defence claim was extremely difficult to overcome. Stand Your Ground makes not only prosecution, but even mere investigation, very difficult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original Stand Your Ground legislation was crafted by state lawmakers who stuck closely to guidelines set by Marion Hammer, a Florida-based former president of the NRA. After it was signed into law by the then Florida Governor, Jeb Bush, in April 2005, the NRA's chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, described it as the &quot;first step of a multi-state strategy&quot;. Its passage was smoothed by ALEC, a conservative network whose backers include the NRA, Walmart and organisations linked to the right-wing billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stand Your Ground offers immunity not only to homeowners, but to people who open fire in public places, and those pleading self-defence need not retreat from anyone they perceive as a threat before shooting. As in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, the burden is on police and prosecutors to prove that a self-defence claim is false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Jansen is the Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, who says his members nationwide encounter Stand Your Ground issues daily. &quot;If a police officer or someone in the military is engaged in a shooting, they go through a process to ensure that shooting was justified,&quot; he says. &quot;Yet we are granting both criminal and civil immunity to citizens who don't have nearly the same levels of firearms training as police officers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within six years of the law's introduction, the number of so-called &quot;justifiable homicides&quot; in Florida had increased threefold. But the law offered no protection to Marissa Alexander, 31, from Jacksonville, who last year was convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot to ward off her abusive husband. No one was injured in the incident. Alexander, who is black, cited Stand Your Ground to no avail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spread and persistence of the law may be a major political success for the NRA, but it has resulted in some blowback for its supporters. Not long after the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin shooting, several major corporate sponsors withdrew their backing from ALEC, including McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Kraft. In April 2012, the group finally scrapped the task force responsible for pushing Stand Your Ground.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Justice Department has announced it will reopen its own investigation into George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer who shot dead an unarmed teenager in Florida in February 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal inquiry, which had been suspended pending the criminal trial, will look into whether Zimmerman, 29, can be prosecuted on hate-crime charges. Civil rights leaders said they still believe the shooting occurred in part because its victim, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of peaceful demonstrators joined a rally that began in New York's Union Square on Sunday afternoon and later flooded into Times Square, remaining there until late into the night. Meanwhile, protests on the West Coast, in Los Angeles and San Francisco, were dispersed by police firing beanbag rounds. They followed a series of impromptu demonstrations in cities across the US on Saturday night, including in Washington DC, Atlanta and Oakland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision the six jurors reached in the George Zimmerman trial would inspire anger, frustration, and despair, but little surprise, writes Jelani Cobb.  &quot;From the outset...there was a nagging suspicion that it would culminate in disappointment. Call this historical profiling,&quot; writes Cobb. &quot;The most damning element here is not that George Zimmerman was not found guilty, it's the bitter knowledge that Trayvon Martin was found guilty...that he had done something to cause his own death.&quot; The defence attorney, during his post-verdict press conference, had said that were his client (George Zimmerman) black, he would never have been charged. Cobb calls it a  &quot;simplistic and obtuse&quot; argument. &quot;The added quotient of outrage in cases like this one stems from the knowledge that race determines whether fear, history, and public sentiment offer that killer a usable alibi.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While British royalty enthusiasts wait eagerly for the impending birth of Prince William and Kate Middleton's first-born, &quot;this child will be the first ever to become rightful heir to the British throne totally regardless of gender,&quot; writes Kathryn Dill. That's because the new Succession to the Crown Act has cast aside the law of male primogeniture, which had for centuries decreed that the heir to the British crown had to be male. Though &quot;male primogeniture is still very much in practice among the British aristocracy...the British people seem to feel right at home with women at the royal helm,&quot; writes Dill.</SPAN></P>

The British &amp; Irish Lions beat Australia in rugby. The England cricket team is expected to do the same in the Ashes. At the Olympics last year, Great Britain finished third on the medals tally. &quot;To put it another way: is there any country on earth that is right now, pound for pound, better at sport than Britain?&quot; asks Tim Lewis. But, he says, the evidence is that Britain is struggling to come to terms with this success. Lewis goes on to ask: &quot;How, then, should we react to our newfound status as overdogs? One precedent is Australia, the most recent holder of the title, which I may or may not have invented, of Pound for Pound Dominant Sporting Nation on the planet. We can allow our success to define us. Sport can become our thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of George Zimmerman should be a call to reform laws that make it easier to kill. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may not be possible to consider the case of George Zimmerman, who was acquitted Saturday of all charges in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, as anything but a sad commentary on the state of race relations and the battle over gun rights in America today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly it is about race - ask any black man, up to and including President Obama, and he will tell you at least a few stories that sound eerily like what happened that rainy winter night in Sanford, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Zimmerman's conviction might have provided an emotional catharsis, we would still be a country plagued by racism, which persists in ever more insidious forms despite the Supreme Court's sanguine assessment that ''things have changed dramatically,'' as it said in last month's ruling striking down the heart of the Voting Rights Act. (The Justice Department is right to continue its investigation into whether Mr. Zimmerman may still be prosecuted under federal civil rights laws.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury reached its verdict after having been asked to consider Mr. Zimmerman's actions in light of Florida's now-notorious Stand Your Ground statute. Under that law, versions of which are on the books in two dozen states, a person may use deadly force if he or she ''reasonably believes'' it is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm - a low bar that the prosecutors in this case fought in vain to overcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These laws sound intuitive: who would argue that you may not protect yourself against great harm? But of course, the concept of ''reasonable belief'' is transformed into something deadly dangerous when firearms are involved. And when the Stand Your Ground laws intersect with lax concealed-carry laws, it works essentially to self-deputize anyone with a Kel-Tec 9 millimeter and a grudge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been a bad year so far for gun control. But if anything, cases like this should be as troubling as the mass killings that always prompt a national outcry and promises of legislative remedy. We were heartened that President Obama, in his statement after the verdict was issued, took the opportunity to denounce once again ''the tide of gun violence'' sweeping the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, what is most frightening is that there are so many people with guns who are like George Zimmerman. Fear and racism may never be fully eliminated by legislative or judicial order, but neither should our laws allow and even facilitate their most deadly expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was an unarmed boy walking home from the convenience store. If only Florida could give him back his life as easily as it is giving back George Zimmerman's gun.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal inquiry was started last year shortly after Trayvon Martin was shot by George Zimmerman but was delayed while the Florida criminal trial was under way. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Justice Department has said that it is restarting its investigation into the 2012 shooting death of a black Florida teenager to consider possible federal hate crime charges against George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who was acquitted by a jury over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal inquiry, which was started shortly after the shooting last year of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, but had been delayed while the state criminal trial in Florida was under way, was being restarted after civil rights leaders called on the Justice Department to re-examine the case. The leaders said Sunday that they remained convinced that the shooting had a racial element.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is a pattern of George Zimmerman making dozens of calls to 911 over several years, frequently about young men of color,'' Benjamin T. Jealous, the president and chief executive of the N.A.A.C.P., said in an interview Sunday. Mr. Zimmerman and his family have defended the shooting as an act of self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, 29, had faced charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter - and the prospect of decades in jail, if convicted - stemming from his fatal shooting of Mr. Martin, 17, on the night of Feb. 26, 2012, in Sanford, a modest Central Florida city. Late Saturday, he was acquitted of all charges by the jurors, all of them women and none black, who had deliberated more than 16 hours over two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement Sunday, the Justice Department said that now that the state criminal trial was over, it would continue its examination of the circumstances in the shooting. ''Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction,'' the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department sets a high bar for such a prosecution. Three former Justice Department officials who once worked in the department's Civil Rights Division, which is handling the inquiry, said Sunday that the federal government must clear a series of difficult legal hurdles before it could move to indict Mr. Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It is not enough if it's just a fight that escalated,'' said Samuel Bagenstos, who until 2011 served as the principal deputy assistant attorney general in the division. ''The government has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant acted willfully with a seriously culpable state of mind'' to violate Mr. Martin's civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal charges under federal hate crime law have increased significantly during the Obama administration. Between 2009 and 2012, the Justice Department prosecuted 29 percent more such cases than in the previous three fiscal years. Last month in Seattle, for example, Jamie Larson, 49, pleaded guilty to federal hate crime charges that he beat a cabdriver, who was from India and was wearing a turban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase is in part because of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, enacted in 2009, which removed a requirement that a victim had to be engaged in a federally protected activity, like voting or going to school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Obama administration's Justice Department has been cautious in its use of the expanded law. In 2010, for example, it turned down calls by civil rights leaders to file charges in New York City in the 2006 death of Sean Bell, a 23-year-old black man who was fatally shot by police officers outside a Queens club just hours before he was to be married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There aren't that many of these cases, and it is not because the government is not being vigilant,'' said William R. Yeomans, a former chief of staff in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. ''It is very difficult to establish a defendant's state of mind.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the Florida jury's verdict reverberated from church pulpits to street protests across the United States in a renewed debate about race, crime and the U.S. justice system. Lawmakers, members of the clergy and demonstrators who assembled in parks and squares on a hot July day described Mr. Zimmerman's acquittal as evidence of a persistent racism that afflicts the nation five years after it elected its first African-American president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Trayvon Benjamin Martin is dead because he and other black boys and men like him are seen not as a person but a problem,'' the Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, told a congregation once led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Warnock noted that the verdict came less than a month after the Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 to void a provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. ''The last few weeks have been pivotal to the consciousness of black America,'' he said in an interview after services. ''Black men have been stigmatized.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama, calling Mr. Martin's death a tragedy, urged Americans Sunday to respect the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a tragedy,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement. ''Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America. I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reactions to the verdict suggested that racial relations remained polarized in many parts of this country, particularly regarding the justice system and the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I pretty well knew that Mr. Zimmerman was going to be let free, because if justice was blind of colors, why wasn't there any minorities on the jury?'' said Willie Pettus, 57, of Richmond, Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maxine McCrey, attending services at Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York, said the verdict was a reminder of the failure of the justice system. ''There's no justice for black people,'' she said. ''Profiling and targeting our black men has not stopped.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. McCrey dabbed at her eyes as she recalled the moment she learned of the verdict. ''I cried,'' she said. ''And I am still crying.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many blacks, and some whites, questioned whether Mr. Zimmerman, who is part Hispanic, would have been acquitted if he were black and Mr. Martin were white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He would have been in jail already,'' Leona Ellzy, 18, said as she visited a monument to Mr. Martin in Sanford. ''The black man would have been in prison for killing a white child.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Fard, a community organizer in a black neighborhood in Denver, Colorado, said Mr. Martin would be alive today if he had not been black. ''If the roles were reversed, Trayvon would have been instantly arrested and, by now, convicted,'' he said. ''Those are realities that we have to accept.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even race's role in the case became a matter of a debate. One of Mr. Zimmerman's lawyers, Mark O'Mara, said he also thought the outcome would have been different if his client were black - but for reasons entirely different from those suggested by people like Mr. Fard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He never would have been charged with a crime,'' Mr. O'Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This became a focus for a civil rights event, which again is a wonderful event to have,'' he said. ''But they decided that George Zimmerman would be the person who they were to blame and sort of use as the creation of a civil rights violation, none of which was borne out by the facts. The facts that night were not borne out that he acted in a racial way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Atlanta, Tommy Keith, 62, a white retired Cadillac salesman, rejected any contention that this was anything more than a failed murder case presented by the state. ''The state's got to prove their case, O.K.?'' he said. ''They didn't.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within moments of the announcement of the verdict Saturday night and continuing through Sunday, demonstrations, some planned and some impromptu, arose in neighborhoods in Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, New York and Atlanta. There were no reports of serious violence or arrests as Sunday went on, a contrast with the riots that swept Los Angeles after the verdict in another race-tinged case, the 1992 acquittal of white Los Angeles police officers in the beating of Rodney King, a black construction worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As dusk fell in New York, a modest rally that had begun hours earlier in Union Square grew to a crowd of thousands that snaked through Midtown Manhattan toward Times Square in an unplanned parade. Onlookers used cellphones to snap pictures of the chanting protesters and their escort by dozens of police cars and scores of officers on foot. Hundreds of bystanders left the sidewalks to join the peaceful demonstration, which brought traffic to a standstill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In downtown Oakland, California, dozens of protesters filled the streets to denounce the verdict shortly after it was announced. Some of the protesters set fire to trash cans, broke the windows of businesses and damaged police patrol cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 40 people in Atlanta, carrying sodas and Skittles to underscore the errand to a store that Mr. Martin was completing when he was shot, marched to Woodruff Park on Saturday night. In Washington, about 250 marchers protested the verdict late Saturday and early Sunday as police cruisers trailed them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hundred protesters gathered at a rally in downtown Chicago on Sunday, some wearing signs showing Mr. Martin wearing a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm heartbroken, but it didn't surprise me,'' said Velma Henderson, 65, a retired state employee who lived in a southern suburb of Chicago. ''The system is screwed. It's a racist system, and it's not designed for African-Americans.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar sense of resignation flowed through St. Sabina, a Catholic church on the South Side of Chicago, where many parishioners are black. They gathered in the sanctuary holding signs that read, ''Trayvon&nbsp;Martin murdered again by injustice system.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Like many of you, I'm angered, I'm disappointed, I'm disgusted,'' said the Rev. Michael Pfleger, who is white, to his congregation at St. Sabina. ''And yet like many of you, I'm not shocked. 'Cause unfortunately, this is the America that we know all too well. Yesterday, we watched the justice system fail miserably again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As blacks and whites struggled with the racial implications of the debate, many called for prayer and peace and urged that there be no escalation of violence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a case that has divided the United States, a man who shot and killed an unarmed teenager has gone free. His defense was helped by spotty police work, a muddled witness and a weak prosecution. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the moment in February of last year when George Zimmerman held up his arms and told the police that he had shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, one fact was undisputed: An unarmed black teenager lay dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as one top Florida defense lawyer, Michael Band, said Sunday, ''Trials, for better or worse, are not morality plays.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the start, prosecutors faced a difficult case - weak on evidence and long on outrage. Mr. Zimmerman had the power of self-defense laws on his side, and he was helped by a spotty police investigation and prosecutorial missteps. The initial investigation foundered when the local prosecutor balked at bringing charges, convinced that overcoming the self-defense claims would prove impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But six weeks after the killing, his replacement, Angela B. Corey, from the Jacksonville, Florida, area, charged Mr. Zimmerman with second-degree murder, a tall order. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial, the fight between Mr. Martin and Mr. Zimmerman that preceded the shooting produced a muddle of testimony - and grist for reasonable doubt. It remained unclear who had thrown the first punch and at what point Mr. Zimmerman drew his gun. There were no witnesses to the shooting and there was no definitive determination of which man could be heard yelling for help in the background of a 911 call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only version of events came from Mr. Zimmerman, who did not take the stand, denying prosecutors a chance to cross-examine him. His statements to the police spoke for him at the trial. Defense lawyers also had a powerful piece of evidence in photographs of Mr. Zimmerman's injuries: a bloody nose and cuts and lumps on the back of his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, claimed that he shot Mr. Martin only after the teenager knocked him to the ground, punched him, straddled him and slammed his head into the concrete - ''a weapon,'' as his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, called it. The murder charge required a showing that Mr. Zimmerman was full of ill will, hatred, spite or evil intent when he shot Mr. Martin. But prosecutors had little evidence to back up that claim, legal experts said. They could point only to Mr. Zimmerman's words during his call to the police dispatcher the night he spotted Mr. Martin walking in the rain with his sweatshirt's hood up and grew suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Punks,'' he said, adding a profanity. ''They always get away,'' he said, using another profanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Zimmerman appeared calm during the call and did not describe Mr. Martin's race until he was asked. And defense lawyers brought in witnesses to say that Mr. Zimmerman, on the whole, was a courteous, kind and caring neighbor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That was a fatal flaw right from the start in the case,'' said Jeff Weiner, a well-known Miami criminal defense lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toward the end of the trial, prosecutors asked the judge to include the lesser charge of manslaughter, but the jury rejected that as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts pointed to what they said were errors by the prosecution. Several prosecution witnesses struggled on the stand and appeared not to have been prepared, including Rachel Jeantel, the young friend of Mr. Martin's who said he had told her on the phone that he was being followed and was scared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors interviewed Ms. Jeantel for the first time in the house of Sybrina Fulton, Mr. Martin's mother, while Ms. Fulton sat next to her. Shaken up by Ms. Fulton's presence, Ms. Jeantel softened her account of the phone call to protect Ms. Fulton, she testified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors also were hurt by the testimony of Officer Chris Serino of the Sanford Police Department, the chief investigator on the case. He told the jury he believed Mr. Zimmerman's account was truthful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet another trouble spot was the testimony of Dr. Shiping Bao, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Mr. Martin. On the stand, legal experts said, he came across as befuddled, shuffling through his notes because he could remember so little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It was horrific,'' said Richard Sharpstein, a prominent Miami criminal defense lawyer. ''It was the deadly blow to this case because the case depended on forensic evidence to contradict or disprove George Zimmerman's story.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The performance was the opposite of that by Dr. Vincent Di Maio, a nationally recognized forensic pathologist, who took the stand for the defense. Polished and concise, Dr. Di Maio said the evidence and injuries to Mr. Zimmerman were consistent with the defense's account: that Mr. Martin was leaning over the defendant when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When Bao completely imploded, that was check,'' Mr. Sharpstein said. ''When Di Maio testified, it was checkmate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence of Mr. Zimmerman's injuries may have helped his case, but it was not legally necessary. He needed to show only that he feared great bodily harm or death when he pulled out his gun, which he was carrying legally, and shot Mr. Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Classic self-defense,'' Mr. O'Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after Mr. Zimmerman was arrested, there appeared to be a chance that the defense would invoke a provision of Florida self-defense law known as Stand Your Ground. Ultimately it was not part of Mr. O'Mara's courtroom strategy, though it did play a pivotal role immediately after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provision, enacted by the Florida Legislature in 2005 and since adopted by more than 20 other states, allows people who fear great harm or death not to retreat, even if they can safely do so. If an attacker is retreating, people are still permitted to use deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provision also allows a defendant claiming self-defense to seek civil and criminal immunity at a pretrial hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. O'Mara said he did not rely on Stand Your Ground as a defense because Mr. Zimmerman had no option to retreat. A pretrial immunity hearing, which prosecutors said they had been expecting, would only have divulged his case. So Mr. O'Mara gambled on a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That was a brilliant strategic move,'' Mr. Sharpstein said. ''It precluded the state from previewing the defense.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Stand Your Ground did play a role when the police were contemplating whether to charge Mr. Zimmerman, said Tamara Lave, an associate professor of law at the University of Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the law, if the police believe there is probable cause that someone acted in self-defense, as Mr. Zimmerman said he had, they are not allowed to make an arrest, she said. The self-defense claim also may have affected how thoroughly the police interviewed witnesses, preserved the crime scene and screened Mr. Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, the police arrested Mr. Zimmerman, but only after Governor Rick Scott of Florida had appointed Ms. Corey as prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference after the verdict, Ms. Corey said prosecutors had been hindered by the fact they inherited the case well into the investigation. Still, she forged ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What we promised to do was get this case in front of a jury,'' she said, ''and give Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and George Zimmerman their day in court.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">CORRECTION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A news analysis on Tuesday about legal issues in the murder trial of  George Zimmerman referred incompletely to the use of the Stand Your Ground provision of Florida's self-defense law. As the article correctly noted, Mr. Zimmerman's defense lawyers did not use the Stand Your Ground strategy in the self-defense case for their client. Some of the provision's language, however -- that Mr. Zimmerman &quot;had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force,&quot; including deadly force -- was contained in the judge's instructions to the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mob Justice: Attorney General Eric Holder confirms he'll do the bidding of racial arsonists and look into bringing criminal civil-rights charges against George Zimmerman. Good luck with that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state of Florida just spent more than $1 million prosecuting Zimmerman for murder in the Trayvon Martin shooting and couldn't find a shred of evidence he was animated by racial hatred. A jury summarily dismissed the trumped-up charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, charging Zimmerman under federal hate-crimes law would defy the findings of the FBI's own investigation conducted last year. All told, agents interviewed no fewer than 45 Zimmerman co-workers, neighbors and other acquaintances -- including even his ex-fiance -- and found no evidence of racial bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None said Zimmerman, a neighborhood crime watch captain, had expressed racial animus at any time prior to the Feb. 26, 2012, self-defense shooting of Martin, who while under the influence of illegal drugs had jumped Zimmerman, breaking his nose and bashing his head repeatedly on the pavement. The 17-year-old Martin was visiting Zimmerman's gated community in Sanford, Fla., while on school suspension for alleged burglary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lead Sanford Police Detective Chris Serino told the FBI that race wasn't behind the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Serino believed that Zimmerman's actions were not based on Martin's skin color (but) rather on his attire, the total circumstances of the encounter and the previous burglary suspects in the community,&quot; the FBI wrote in its report. &quot;Serino described Zimmerman as overzealous and as having a &quot;little hero complex,' but not as a racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even an African-American officer -- Sanford Police Sgt. Arthur Barns -- denied Zimmerman targeted Martin because he was black. He &quot;felt the shooting was not racially motivated,&quot; the FBI report stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also noted Zimmerman's mixed-race family and volunteer work helping underprivileged African-American children. Not only does he have black relatives, he has also donated his time tutoring black kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In effect, the FBI has already cleared Zimmerman of race crime. If anybody's civil rights were violated, it was Zimmerman's -- with help from Holder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Holder and his pal Al Sharpton pressured state prosecutors to rush out an arrest warrant, Zimmerman was denied a grand jury review of evidence and any formal indictment -- in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that arrest affidavit was nakedly corrupt. Special prosecutor Angela Corey withheld material exculpatory facts, such as photos of head and facial wounds suffered by Zimmerman, which backed his claims of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey also withheld exculpatory evidence from Zimmerman's defense team. After a whistleblower from her office -- Ben Kruidbos -- testified prosecutors failed to turn over damning photos and text messages retrieved from Martin's cellphone, Corey fired him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During her &quot;fair and unbiased&quot; investigation, Corey prayed with Martin's parents, even holding their hands during one meeting. She not only overcharged Zimmerman but also covered up evidence that would have exonerated him. In short, she denied him due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if the Justice Department wants to launch an investigation into the Zimmerman case, it ought to focus on Corey and her corrupt office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A criminal court is for facts and evidence, not questions of race and prejudice, legal experts here said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the entire matter was politically motivated,&quot; veteran defense lawyer Barry Goldman said Monday morning. &quot;Criminal cases aren't meant to be political statements.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many here say the crux of the case - which they say was not proven in court - rested on whether Zimmerman or Martin escalated the confrontation that led to the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think anyone could positively say what started it,&quot; said defense attorney Jeff Conrad, a former prosecutor. &quot;It's a critical piece to whether this was self-defense or murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Goldman: &quot;There had to be a belief on the jury's part that an altercation had occurred and Zimmerman was getting the worst of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors sought a guilty verdict for second-degree murder, a charge, experts here say, that was likely brought because of the influence of outside pressures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought from the beginning that the fact that the state's attorney initially decided not to pursue charges, and that homicide charges were only filed in response to political pressure, was a sign that the case was weak,&quot; said defense attorney Edwin Pfursich, also a former prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Steven Breit said Zimmerman was &quot;overcharged&quot; from the start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was merely a homicide - with a self-defense claim - which prosecutors didn't prove,&quot; Breit said on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some locals said police and prosecutors might even have allowed media reports to influence them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We see a lot of things that we may not like,&quot; Conrad said. &quot;But that's not the impetus for charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, several locals said the verdict doesn't vindicate Zimmerman's behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to remember that &quot;not guilty&quot; does not necessarily mean the jury found that Zimmerman acted perfectly or was 100 perfect innocent,&quot; Stedman said, &quot;just that the state could not prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Christopher Lyden said prosecutors should have focused on disproving Zimmerman's self-defense claim from the start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought the prosecution presented a weak case,&quot; said Lyden, who has litigated several homicide cases here. &quot;They could have disproved self-defense by showing that Zimmerman provoked the fight, but failed to do so in a convincing way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Goldman: &quot;You can't be the aggressor and benefit from self-defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldman went on to say that if Zimmerman approached Martin, that doesn't mean Zimmerman surrenders his self-defense rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldman provided a hypothetical situation: If someone walks to a parking lot and finds someone leaning on their car, he or she has the right to tell that person to get off. If a struggle ensues and the car owner doesn't have a safe route to retreat, he or she is allowed to defend themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly, each side had a role in that confrontation. When Trayvon is on top, (Zimmerman's) duty to retreat no longer applies,&quot; Goldman said. &quot;The fact that (Martin) was unarmed had nothing to do with it. I can be threatened to death by someone's bare hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors told the six Florida jurors in opening statements that they wanted a murder conviction. Later in the trial, they asked the jury to consider manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Martin was killed on Feb. 26, 2012, prosecutors initially balked at charging Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norman Wolfinger, the Florida state's attorney, determined that charges were not appropriate. Perhaps giving in to pressure from civil rights groups, Florida's governor appointed a special prosecutor to review the case. She decided to charge Zimmerman with second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a perfect example of how prosecutors need to take politics out of the courtroom,&quot; Conrad said. &quot;What drives a charge is evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political pressure has grown on the Obama administration to bring a federal prosecution against George Zimmerman, who was acquitted of murdering the unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weekend protests following Mr Zimmerman's acquittal on Saturday and the promise of another day of action next Saturday over the verdict has sparked a national debate about race and renewed the US department of justice investigation into the shooting of 17-year-old Mr Martin in Florida last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Holder, US attorney general, said the department shared public concerns over &quot;the tragic, unnecessary shooting death&quot; and vowed that federal prosecutors would continue to investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Independent of the legal determination that will be made, I believe that this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised,&quot; Holder said in a speech in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must not - as we have too often in the past - let this opportunity pass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be further pressure on Mr Holder today when he addresses the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) in Orlando, not far from the courthouse in the town of Sanford where Mr Zimmerman was acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DetailMr Holder is expected to speak about the case in greater detail in his speech to the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of thousands of protesters have signed online petitions by the NAACP urging the department of justice to bring federal charges against Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury found the 29-year-old neighbourhood watchman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter after concluding he had acted in self-defence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman had followed Mr Martin, who was returning to relatives in the gated community from a nearby shop, and shot him with a legally held gun after Mr Martin knocked him to the ground and punched him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights activists want the US government to take criminal charges under federal law covering hate crimes. Prosecutors would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Zimmerman, who is of white and Hispanic origin, shot Mr Martin because he was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Holder, the first black attorney general, said yesterday the department of justice would continue to act &quot;in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House said President Barack Obama would have no role in deciding whether federal charges are brought against Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cases are brought on the merits and the merits are evaluated by the professionals at the department of justice,&quot; said the president's spokesman Jay Carney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Not over'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights activist Al Sharpton said vigils for Mr Martin would be held in at least 100 cities across the US next Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not over and we are going to make sure it's not over,&quot; he said in a radio interview. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing Martin's killing a tragedy, Mr Obama said on Sunday that the jury had spoken, and he urged &quot;calm reflection&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's acquittal of the murder of unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and the responding protests in major US cities have reheated the debate about racism in American life and whether the criminal justice system is stacked against African-Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman (29), a neighbourhood watchman in Sanford, Florida, left court a free man on Saturday night even though there was no doubt that on the night of February 26th, 2012, he shot dead a black teenager armed with a bag of Skittles returning from a nearby 7-11 store.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siding with his self-defence claim, a jury found that Zimmerman, who said he was knocked to the ground and punched and slammed against a pavement by Martin, was justified in using his legally held gun on the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict, handed down under Florida's broad &quot;stand your ground&quot; self-defence law, has left millions of Americans shocked that Zimmerman could seek out what he thought was trouble that night and act, leading to the death of a 17-year-old - only to be found not to have committed a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge barred any consideration of whether racial profiling motivated Zimmerman's decision to confront Martin - whether he killed the teenager because he didn't like the look of him walking through his gated community, because he was black and wore a hoodie, and wrongly assumed he was out to cause trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ShockingIt may not have been debated in court but race was at the heart of this trial. That a jury made a legally sound interpretation of Florida's laws based on the evidence presented to them has proven even more shocking for Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle Alexander, author of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The New Jim Crow</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the 2012 bestselling book that argued that the decades-old fight against crime in the US deliberately eroded the gains of the civil rights movement, summed up the killing simply: if Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had been born white, he would be alive today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the Zimmerman mindset that must be found guilty - far more than the man himself,&quot; the law professor wrote in a post on her Facebook page on Saturday in response to the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a mindset that views black men and boys as nothing but a threat, good for nothing, up to no good, no matter who they are or what they are doing. It is the Zimmerman mindset that has birthed a penal system unprecedented in world history, and relegated millions to a permanent undercaste.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Stand your ground' lawsIn 2005 Florida became the first in a wave of more than 20 states to introduce &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws extending protection for self-defence by removing a person's duty to retreat before they could use lethal force. In other words, you didn't have to show that you tried to get away from a threatening person before shooting them if you reasonably believed that they were going to hurt or kill you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law placed a heavy burden of proof on the prosecution in the Zimmerman case and made it difficult, in light of the weak evidence, to prove that he did not act in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case is being cited as another statistic showing how &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws lead unnecessarily to higher numbers of deaths - 8 per cent or 600 homicides more a year, according to a study by Texas A&amp;M University - and reinforce a racial bias in the wider US criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whites who kill blacks in &quot;stand your ground&quot; states are also far more likely to be found justified in these killings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these states whites are 354 per cent more likely to be found justified in killing a black person than a white person killing another white person compared with 250 per cent elsewhere, according to research by John Roman, a fellow at the Urban Institute think tank in Washington DC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some politicians, such as the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, have argued that the US justice system is blind to colour. But statistics show disproportionately more severe enforcement against black Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Longer sentencesBlack men received almost 20 per cent longer prison sentences than white men convicted of similar crimes, the US sentencing commission said in a report published in February. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black Americans were nearly four times as likely as whites to be arrested on marijuana possession charges in 2010 even though both groups used the drug at similar rates, the American Civil Liberties Union said in a report published last month, citing federal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Kennedy, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention and Control at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, says it is not helpful to put Martin's death down to racial profiling, which only makes sense in the context of law enforcement; his killing comes down simply to racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin- George Zimmerman case is another instance of another black man killed for no good reason by somebody and the duly constituted legal process saying that this is okay,&quot; Kennedy says.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the early hours of Monday morning, the last of those who had gathered to protest against the verdict of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin murder case had still not exhausted their sense of outrage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What began as a heavily attended demonstration in Union Square on Sunday afternoon freewheeled into a gathering of thousands of concerned citizens in Times Square, 3km away, before several groups began making their way to the Adam Clayton Powell memorial in Harlem, chanting &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; as they marched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is about solidarity - all races and all creeds turned out today,&quot; said Daniel Alexander, who carried a sign bearing the victim's name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ArrestsSeveral arrests were made as the disparate groups made their way uptown, chanting as they marched through the privileged sections of Park Avenue and the Upper East Side. When they reached 125th street in Harlem, drivers honked their horns and locals sitting on the steps of their brownstones trying to keep cool in the midnight heat applauded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You really feel that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin suffered two deaths when he was killed,&quot; Danny Maree, from the East Village, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One came from George Zimmerman's gun and the second from the justice department when they failed to arrest anyone. That is institutionalised racism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police and media helicopters hovered over the Harlem high-rises as the march wound on. The police presence was heavy but restrained and led to  conversations about contentious stop-and-frisk policy, perceived as a low-grade harassment which the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin   starkly illuminated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gentrified&quot;This area is becoming gentrified</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. New people are moving in,&quot; said Daniel Alexander. &quot;So if you are new here, you can see how police will treat people of colour. I have been stopped, I've been frisked.  &quot;In New York that has become a natural occurrence in life and that is the sad part. It is not just a black and white thing necessarily.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 12.30am, after a brief rally on the corner of Malcolm X boulevard and 148th Street, the marchers moved  towards the Bronx.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of George Zimmerman, a Florida neighbourhood watch volunteer, for the murder of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old African-American, has reignited America's ever-combustible debates on race and gun violence. The verdict triggered mostly peaceful demonstrations across the country and reinforced the view of many African-Americans that the justice system remains tilted against people of colour. Many white conservatives, on the other hand, have welcomed the collapse of a prosecution they believe should never have been taken as a defeat for &quot;race baiters&quot; in the black community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was walking home from a convenience store in February 2012, carrying only iced tea and fruit sweets, when Zimmerman called the police to say that the hoodie-wearing teenager was acting suspiciously. Despite a police warning to remain in his truck, Zimmerman followed Martin and they engaged in a tussle that ended with the black teenager being shot dead. It was almost six weeks before police charged Zimmerman, who insisted he shot Martin in self-defence as he thought his life was in danger. The jury accepted the defence argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US justice department has revived an investigation into the incident that it put on hold during Zimmerman's trial and he could yet face criminal civil rights charges, though most legal experts believe that such federal action is unlikely. President Barack Obama, who said after the killing that &quot;if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; has called for calm but questioned whether Americans have done enough to stem gun violence that claims the lives of so many Americans each day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth is that US lawmakers, cowed by a powerful and well-funded gun lobby, have done almost nothing to combat gun violence. And the election of the country's first black president has neither ushered in a post-racial America nor significantly diminished the injustice faced by many black Americans, particularly young men, in their own country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOW that George Zimmerman has been cleared of all charges in the killing of Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, he intends to reclaim the gun he used to shoot dead the unarmed 17-year-old. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, Mr Zimmerman needs a firearm to protect himself now &quot;even more&quot; than before. He said Mr Zimmerman (29) &quot;feels, truly in his heart, that if he did not have that weapon (on the night of the shooting) he might not be here&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelation came as America''s top justice official pledged to tackle &quot;the underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs and stereotypes&quot; behind violence against young people as demands by black leaders grew for Mr Zimmerman to be charged with federal hate crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments by Eric Holder, the US attorney general, were his clearest reference to claims that Mr Zimmerman shot dead Trayvon after racially profiling the unarmed black teenager as a possible criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighbourhood watch volunteer was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges on Saturday in a controversial verdict that has provoked protests across the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Holder, who described Trayvon''s killing as &quot;tragic, unnecessary&quot;, confirmed that the Justice Department had reopened a federal investigation into Mr Zimmerman that had been on hold while the court case played out in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Holder''s comments seemed to indicate scepticism about Mr Zimmerman''s successful self-defence case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But legal experts said that his department would face major challenges in any attempt to prove that Mr Zimmerman''s actions were based on racial discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Holder tacitly acknowledged those difficulties. But his comments also reflected pressure from civil rights leaders on him and President Barack Obama, who are the first African-Americans to hold their positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are mindful of the pain felt by our nation surrounding the tragic, unnecessary shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Mr Holder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to assure you that the department will continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law. We are determined to meet division and confusion with understanding and compassion - and also with truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are resolved to combat violence involving or directed at young people, to prevent future tragedies and to deal with the underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs and stereotypes that serve as the basis for these too common incidents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke as leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, the biggest US black rights group, intensified demands for a federal prosecution at a meeting in Orlando, just a 30-minute drive from Sanford, where Trayvon was shot dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Sharpton, the activist black preacher, said that he would head to Sanford and announced plans for protests in 100 cities this weekend to increase pressure on the Justice Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Carney, Mr Obama''s spokesman, said that the president would not be involved in the decision on whether to bring federal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, Mr Obama called for calm as &quot;we ask ourselves how we can prevent future tragedies like this&quot;. (&copy; Daily Telegraph, London)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">526 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fewer still have the vision and fortitude to dedicate their lives to breaking that destructive cycle and freeing divided societies from the self-perpetuating burden of their own intolerance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the greatest modern examples of that exceptionalism - Nelson Mandela - is approaching the end of his long, fruitful life but his great achievement, the relatively peaceful ending of apartheid in South Africa, will live on. We celebrate him far more readily than we try to emulate his behaviour and make his message of tolerance real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequences of an emotionally toxic bequest, hatred - or as often as not fear - learnt on a parent's knee can be seen all around the world. It can be seen in America today in the latest in a long line of jury decisions that seem to have more to do with race than justice - the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be seen on a far grander scale in places like Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan, and more or less on any line dividing conflicting cultures or religions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tragically it can still be seen on this small island despite the lessons given by centuries of conflict and pointless assertions. The pictures of young teenagers, many little more than children, rioting in Belfast over recent days is as disturbing as it is disheartening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old venom, the old sense of grievance and displacement, is being rejuvenated and sustained by invisible puppet masters in both communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another generation of perfectly decent, energetic and probably fair-minded young Irish/British people is being alienated from each other by those determined to champion the integrity of their own eternal cause and the hatred it depends on to endure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Orange Order blame the Parades Commission, the authorities blame Loyalist protestors, and those opposed to parades going through their area believe that their position is entirely reasonable and not at all a factor in the riots of recent nights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sad fact is that all of these groups seem responsible in some way or another for a return to the destruction of property and, far more importantly, probably making it impossible for another generation of Belfast people to live in harmony with each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That this continues despite scores of initiatives in cultural, business, sporting and community forums points to the real darkness at the very heart of this tragic waste of potential and energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course economic circumstances play a part too, but communities right across these islands face similar challenges, but they do not express their frustrations by rioting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is ironic too the institutions supposedly at the root of this conflict - the churches - no longer have the influence needed to break the cycle. There must be a lesson too in the fact that hundreds of other parades passed off peacefully in the last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is terribly disappointing though that so many years after the Belfast Peace Agreement it takes little more than a roll on the tribal war drums for all the old hatreds to reassert themselves and for the riots to begin. Surely it's time all of that tragic social failure expressed through violence was consigned to history?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moment neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old white Latino, shot black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin dead in February 2012 as he walked innocently to his father's home in Sanford, Fla., race and politics took centre stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing reverberated throughout the nation's black communities, whose members know only too well the harsh reality of racial profiling and that the justice system is rife with racial bias, as many studies have shown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these two ingredients were mixed into the judicial process, two other elements in the case retreated into the shadows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those ingredients, however, would prove pivotal: gun control and Florida's socalled &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, plus its related statutes on self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essentially, Zimmerman was able to shoot Martin because Florida law - and the law in most states - permits him to carry a concealed weapon and gave him the right to use that weapon to defend himself against grave bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem, however, is people can get it wrong. They can misinterpret the danger. Luckily for these shooters, the law also protects against that eventuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chaos of such defensive-force situations means that people commonly make mistakes,&quot; Paul Robinson, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, recently wrote in the Wall Street</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The law does not require that a person get it exactly right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It may be enough that the person honestly believed his force was necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman said he followed Martin because he thought he was a robber. When an angry Martin turned on him and began beating him up, Zimmerman shot him in self-defence. That's his story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police declared the shooting was indeed selfdefence, civil rights activists organized mass protests. The dark hoodie Martin wore that fateful night became a civil rights emblem. Federal and state politicians met with prosecutors and urged Zimmerman's arrest and prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing was hashed out in America's newsrooms. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and MSNBC host, travelled to Florida where he led protest marches. CNN and MSNBC claimed the tape of a 911 call made by Zimmerman &quot;clearly&quot; recorded him calling Martin a &quot;coon.&quot; NBC host Joe O'Donnell said the tape &quot;constitutes obvious evidence of hateful intent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN later retracted its statement, admitting that the tape did not contain any racial slur but rather the word &quot;cold.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 16--Prosecutors faced a daunting task in trying to prove George Zimmerman murdered Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Chippewa Valley attorneys said Monday, two days after jurors found Zimmerman not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having to prove that Zimmerman was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt led to the jury's not guilty verdict, said Rich White, a former Eau Claire County district attorney who now works for the Weld, Riley, Prenn &amp; Ricci law firm in Eau Claire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you asked those jurors, that if the burden of proof was lessened, they would have found him guilty,&quot; White said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday a six-person jury found Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager. The decision has sparked outrage on the part of many across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Norseng, an attorney at Wiley Law in Chippewa Falls who also is a Chippewa County court commissioner, views the jury instructions in Florida as a reason why a not guilty verdict was given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Wisconsin, jurors are asked to examine the evidence and find a person guilty if they have &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; However, Florida jurors are told they must be &quot;absolutely certain,&quot; Norseng said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think you can define 'absolutely certain' as higher than 'beyond a reasonable doubt,' &quot; Norseng said. &quot;Beyond a reasonable doubt is an extremely high burden. It's really not a 'not guilty' decision. It's a decision of 'we don't know for sure, so we can't convict.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week the prosecution was criticized for asking a police officer if he found Zimmerman's account of the assault to be believable. The officer said he thought Zimmerman was truthful in his testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite that, White said he doesn't believe he would have handled the case much differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot be necessarily critical of the prosecution's effort in this case,&quot; White said. &quot;When you have situations like this, when you have a death and the evidence is competing in how you conclude the evidence, it's very difficult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reading juries is extremely difficult, White said, noting that he's noticed a rise in hung juries as more people watch law-and-order television shows that make them feel like they have more knowledge of the law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They spent 15 hours (deliberating), so they put in their time on it,&quot; Ferg said. &quot;It's really hard to second guess what any jury does because you really have to be there for the whole trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1504  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Lester Minto raised four daughters in South Texas, just miles from the Mexican border, where most women are Hispanic and 3 out of 5 girls are pregnant before they reach adulthood. <BR>&quot;My wife died and I raised them on my own,&quot; said Minto, 64, who made sure his girls had access to birth control. &quot;Not a single one of mine got pregnant.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the last three decades, Minto, a family physician and advocate for women, has owned the Reproductive Services clinic in Harlingen, Texas, which performs about 1,500 to 2,000 abortions a year. <BR>But now, with the stringent new anti-abortion law that just passed the Texas legislature, he worries that the women he serves, those from &quot;deep&quot; Texas and Mexico, will turn in greater numbers to do-it-yourself remedy for an unwanted pregnancy -- misoprostol, which goes under the name Cytotec. <BR>The drug, used off-label in medical abortions, is smuggled in by relatives from Mexico to begin a miscarriage -- or what Hispanic women call, &quot;bringing your period down,&quot; according to Minto. <BR>Immigrants are lured to abortion drug because of cost barriers to health. <BR>&quot;They get things started, then show up in the emergency room and avoid the negative image of having done an abortion,&quot; said Minto. <BR>Texas Abortion Rule About to Become Law Watch Video&nbsp;Texas Abortion Bill Filibustered Watch Video&nbsp;Eric Holder Vows to Investigate Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Shooting and Combat Stereotypes Watch VideoHispanic women have the highest rate of unwanted pregnancies nationwide -- about 54 percent, according to Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, executive director of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health. Many are uninsured and speak no English. <BR>&quot;With an increase of barriers mounting, what we are hearing is that a lot of women are turning to other folks they know who can smuggle [misoprostol] over the border or are finding it in flea markets,&quot; said Gonzalez-Rojas. <BR>&quot;It's the kind of thing -- people know where to get it and are very quiet. While it's not the most dangerous drug, there are a lot of questions about how to take it appropriately. We have tremendous concerns when women take their health into their own hands.&quot; <BR>Planned Parenthood is not the only casualty in Texas defunding. <BR>And it's not just women in Texas, according to Gonzalez-Rojas. <BR>&quot;There are lots of cases throughout the country of low-income women, even in New York City, using misoprostol or Cytotec,&quot; she said. &quot;I think it's more about the stigma that exists around abortion and they get a lot of mixed messages and turn to underground methods.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Misoprostol, a prostaglandin inhibitor, is usually used as part of a two-part, FDA-approved medical abortion with mifepristone or RU486. Alone, it is routinely used off-label for obstetrical and gynecological procedures such as cervical ripening, labor induction and mid-trimester terminations. It can be used to induce miscarriage, typically up to nine weeks, but can also be safely given in through the second semester.  <BR>In combination, the two drugs are 95 to 97 percent effective. Taken alone, misoprostol is only 80 to 85 percent effective, and is suspected of causing birth defects if it fails.  <BR>After care is critical to ensure the pregnancy tissue is expelled to prevent infection. In a worst-case scenario, if a woman has placenta previa, (when a baby's placenta partially or totally covers the mother's cervix) she can bleed to death if the drug is used alone.  <BR>In 2007, a Massachusetts teenager took misoprostol in an attempt to induce a miscarriage at 25 weeks and the 1-pound baby was delivered prematurely and died. Amber Abreu, who was 18, faced murder charges that were later dismissed.  <BR>&quot;If done properly and done in combination, they are safe,&quot; said Minto. But alone, misoprostol &quot;doesn't work that well.&quot;  <BR>&quot;It's kind of like a cheap cure for a radiator leak,&quot; he said. &quot;Its efficacy rate is about 30 percent when used alone and improperly. But even though I don't approve of it, I can't criticize it. I would probably try the same if I were in a situation like these women.&quot;  <BR>Misoprostol is more readily available than mifepristone because it is prescribed to prevent gastric ulcers.  <BR>Hispanic women call them &quot;star pills&quot; for their hexagonal shape and they are commonly used in Latin America, where abortion is illegal, turning a shameful procedure into something that looks like a miscarriage. American immigrants can obtain them for about $2 a pill from relatives in overseas bodegas and pharmacies, according to Gonzalez-Rojas.  <BR>The Texas law, backed by Republican Gov. Rick Perry, is one of the strictest in the United States. It bans abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and hold clinics like Minto's to the same physical standards as hospital surgical centers.  <BR>Its supporters say that the strengthened regulations for the structures and doctors will protect women's health.  <BR>Rep. Jason Villalba, a Republican from Dallas, said the new law will not have a negative impact on low-income women, as critics have suggested.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am pro-life, but no one is denying Roe v. Wade is the law of the land,&quot; he said. &quot;But if we are going to provide a procedure, then the state has the right to regulate how it's done to protect our women who receive this procedure.   <BR>Texas Abortion Rule About to Become Law Watch Video&nbsp;Texas Abortion Bill Filibustered Watch Video&nbsp;Eric Holder Vows to Investigate Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Shooting and Combat Stereotypes Watch Video&quot;We want women to have the same kind of surgical care, for instance, if they have an appendix or tonsils removed,&quot; said Villalba.   <BR>One of the new regulations is that abortion providers are located within 30 miles of a hospital.   <BR>&quot;If something goes awry,&quot; he said, &quot;it's a serious procedure -- we want the doctor to be able to get to a hospital quickly and provide care.&quot;   <BR>Villalba wouldn't answer questions directly about the possibility of more women using these pills, but argued more broadly that clinics that can't comply with new regulations will &quot;fall by the wayside.&quot; Villalba insisted women who choose abortion will still have access. He said opponents of the bill have exaggerated the numbers of clinics that will close.   <BR>&quot;Here's the good news,&quot; Villalba said. &quot;The clinics [that] remain after the dust is settled will have new standards to protect women.&quot;   <BR>But advocates like Gonzalez-Rojas say the new law is &quot;an affront on women.&quot;   <BR>&quot;What we know is that with the increase of barriers mounting, the limited clinics down there are likely going to close if they face all these regulations,&quot; she said. &quot;Women get put in desperate situations. We don't know how the black market will turn out, so they might get something that isn't the right drug. We are fighting the laws to make sure women get access to care.&quot;   <BR>The bill was opposed by many doctors, including leaders of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Texas Medical Association.   <BR>About 1 in 3 American women will have an abortion by the time they reach 45, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which advocates for sexual and reproductive health and rights. In the first six months of 2013, states enacted 43 restrictions on access to abortion.   <BR>In Texas, the abortion rate has remained steady since 2005. The rate in 2008, the last year for which there are statistics, was lower than in the rest of the country: about 16.5 abortions per 1,000 women, aged 15 to 44. The national rate for that year was 19.6.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You begin to discover the devil is in the details,&quot; said Minto, who said he will either have to close down his clinic or move his practice to Mexico.   <BR>With new regulations, the procedure for a medical abortion takes three days: A woman must get a sonogram and an explanation of the procedure. Twenty-four hours later, she gets the first pill -- RU 486 or mifepristone, a hormone blocker that makes the fetus unviable. After another 24 hours, the woman must return so the doctor can give her misoprostol, which causes the uterus to contract and expel the fetus.   <BR>Until the new law, as is the standard practice in other states, women take the second pill at home and then have a follow up visit with the doctor.   <BR>&quot;It's added another doctor visit and, if you live 250 miles away or more, you have to stay in a hotel,&quot; he said.   <BR>Some women in Texas live as far as to 900 miles from an abortion clinic.   <BR>Minto said the safety record and his certification inspections over the last three decades have been &quot;impeccable.&quot; He charges women less than $500 for a procedure -- either medical or surgical abortion.   <BR>&quot;If you have a case of rape, it's tough,&quot; he said. &quot;Where do you send innocent 12, 12, 13-year-old girls? What do they do? I thought about those girls in Cleveland who were held hostage. According to Texas law, if they get pregnant, after 20 weeks, forget it. We have just gone to Taliban Texas.&quot;   <BR>The next step will be a court challenge to the new law, but Minto is undaunted.   <BR>&quot;My licensed abortion clinic has to close,&quot; said Minto, &quot;But I'll never give up helping women. I am not a quitter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may not be possible to consider the case of George Zimmerman, who was acquitted on Saturday of all charges in the killing of Trayvon Martin, as anything but a sad commentary on the state of race relations and the battle over gun rights in America today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly it is about race - ask any black man, up to and including President Barack Obama, and he will tell you at least a few stories that sound eerily like what happened on that rainy winter night in Sanford, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury reached its verdict after having been asked to consider Zimmerman's actions in light of Florida's now-notorious Stand Your Ground statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under that law, a person may use deadly force if he or she &quot;reasonably believes&quot; it is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm - a low bar that the prosecutors in this case fought in vain to overcome. These laws sound intuitive: who would argue that you may not protect yourself against great harm? But of course, the concept of &quot;reasonable belief&quot; is transformed into something deadly when firearms are involved. And when the law intersects with lax concealed-carry laws, it works essentially to self-deputise anyone with a Kel-Tec 9mm and a grudge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been a bad year for gun control. But if anything, cases like this should be as troubling as the mass killings that always prompt a national outcry and promises of legislative remedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is most frightening is that there are so many people with guns who are like Zimmerman. Fear and racism may not be fully eliminated by legislative or judicial order, but neither should laws allow their most deadly expression. Martin was an unarmed boy walking home. If only Florida could give him back his life as easily as it is giving back Zimmerman's gun. - New York Times 8P8</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They know nothing of racism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no comparison between Emmett Till and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, except this: Juxtapose today's slick music videos with the ubiquitous grainy, black and white reels showing fire hoses and dogs let loose on the helpless crowds scattered in the streets, and it's mortifying how the post-Civil Rights generation goes on and on about racism as if they experienced cross burnings and &quot;colored/whites only&quot; signs. They know nothing of what it's like to endure the genuine oppression of that time, and it's the greatest insult to equate today's shortcomings with yesterday's true racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering the eerie still photos of lynched men in trees with the perpetrators standing on the ground as if posing for elementary class pictures, it's blasphemous how the pre-Civil Rights generation goes on and on about racism as if yesterday's rampant injustice is the same as today's coveted tolerance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They know everything of what it's like to endure those unspeakable acts and it's shameful they denounce the very civil rights advancements that allow them to decry to their heart's content without fear of yesteryear's reprisal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Declaring Trayvon as the new Emmett merely serves to diminish the tangible progress we've made since that night in Money, Mississippi, 1955.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had this not been a white on black tragedy, but instead white on white, black on white, or black on black, it's difficult to imagine that it would have been on national news for weeks or raised the ire of the president, attorney general and NAACP and brought to the streets those who feel a need to protest just about anything.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Greenleaf's July 16 comments are the reason our community and country need men like Ben Jealous who devote their lives to fight for justice and fairness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We applaud Ben Jealous in seeking all avenues of justice allowed by America and our judicial system. We are longtime Monterey County residents and third generation Americans of Mexican descent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greenleaf's inherent need to ethnically dissect Jealous and his parents is despicable and devalues his commentary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downsizing of cemetery maintenance staff and replacing them with outside contractors has left the cemetery in a mess.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank goodness for Jane Parker's common sense leadershipregarding the opening of Intergarrison Road .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I live a few blocks from the intersection of Schoonover and Intergarrison and I can tell you that the area is unsafe for Intergarrison to be open to through traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Parker pointed out in the July 14 Herald, the undeveloped Jerry Smith Trailhead would clearly present an unsafe situation. In addition, the reliance on Eighth Street as a commuter corridor to get to Giggling is poorly planned, because the road is underdeveloped and runs into another trailhead widely used by the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times Intergarrison seems more like Highway 68, with people speeding when the limit is already at 55 mph, while Canyon Del Rey Boulevard is at 45 mph and Gen. Jim Moore ranges from 35 to 45 mph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rate of speed on Intergarrison has created another unsafe environment. Since the road has been closed, more people use the two-mile stretch from Schoonover to CSU Monterey Bay to commute on bicycles and for recreational running and walking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The push to open Intergarrison to through traffic definitely needs to be challenged and put on hold while the issues of public safety are addressed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just wonder: Does anyone have the number of stray animals turned in to the SPCA that were actually caused by the Seaside fireworks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think Seaside is getting a bad rap for this fireworks thing. As far as I know, there were no major injuries and no fires of any kind. It is only one night out of the whole year. People need to get over it. There are so many other things to worry about than a little noise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yes, we have animals. We just stay home to assure them they are safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I vote for letting the people have their parties and fireworks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-racists are planning action in the wake of last Saturday's &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict on the George Zimmerman trial. &quot;If anything good is to come, this is the time to build a movement,&quot; National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) spokesman Eric Wingerter told his organisation's convention in Orlando, Florida, which ends today. He spoke to 4,000 delegates from the US's oldest civil rights organisation just 30 miles from Sanford, where Zimmerman was cleared of murder or manslaughter for shooting unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin dead. We've seen fatalistic reactions to the verdict.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Legally, we have to accept a jury's ruling to acquit former neighbourhood watchman Zimmerman in the shooting death of Florida teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; the victim's lawyer Daryl Parks told Face the Nation on Sunday. He suggested that Florida's &quot;horrible shoot-first law&quot; - the &quot;stand your ground&quot; clause - and the instructions given to the jury made its decision unsurprising. But NAACP president Benjamin Jealous told the same show that federal criminal charges could still await Zimmerman. &quot;There may be a civil action by the family, but there should definitely be criminal charges brought by the Justice Department,&quot; he said. Under the 2009 Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jnr Hate Crimes Prevention Act federal investigators would have to show that race was a factor in Zimmerman's decision-making that fatal night. And Jealous believes &quot;there seems to be plenty of evidence that suggests race may indeed have been a factor.&quot; The Justice Department says its investigation into the matter is &quot;ongoing.&quot; Zimmerman, who at first invoked Florida's stand your ground law, claims he shot Martin in self-defence during a physical fight with him in a Sanford gated community last year. Prosecutors played a tape during the trial in which Zimmerman is heard talking to police over the phone after spotting Martin walking in the neighbourhood. Martin had just finished a family visit and had stopped at a shop to buy sweets. The unarmed 17-year-old, an A-plus student on his way to a college scholarship, was on his way home when he was murdered. Zimmerman was heard on the tape describing Martin to police as a &quot;fucking punk.&quot; When police told him not to pursue Martin he continued to track, stalk and eventually kill him. &quot;These punks always get away,&quot; he was heard to say when police told him to stop following the youth. Many have criticised the prosecution for not being vigorous enough in pushing charges against Zimmerman. The tape mentioned above, for example, was never brought up by the prosecution during its summing up. The prosecution team was appointed by Florida's &quot;tea party&quot; governor Rick Scott and headed by a conservative Republican, Angela Corey. Corey never argued before the court during the trial, leaving that to underlings. Critics claim she did not wish to anger her right-wing constituents whose support she needs for re-election. Georgetown University professor and civil rights activist Michael Eric Dyson says it's clear &quot;the attack was racially motivated from the very beginning. &quot;in the 21st century, in this so-called post-racial era, we know race continues to make a huge difference. &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin cries from the grave for us not only to grieve but to get into action and motivate ourselves - not only African-American people but all good-willed American citizens - to make sure that this death is not in vain.&quot; Civil rights leaders have already met and announced that they intend to make this issue a major focus of the August 24 March on Washington. There will be major efforts to get out a huge vote on these issues in the 2014 mid-term elections. The hope is that we can boot right-wing local lawmakers out of office and elect people who will overturn laws like Florida's stand your ground. This article appeared in People's World</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GEORGE Zimmerman will now carry the same gun he used to kill Trayvon Martin -- and he's going to need it, his lawyer says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyer Mark O'Mara said Zimmerman's acquittal by a Florida jury means he'll get back the Kel Tec-9 pistol he used to fatally shoot Martin last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Zimmerman, 29, intends to alway carry the weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``(There's) even more reason now, isn't there? There are a lot of people out there who actually hate him, though they shouldn't,'' O'Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's brother, Robert Jr, said George had no regrets over the deadly confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Regret implies that your actions you have culpability in what you did for what happened. What you're asking is, `Does he share or accept the blame?' George, outside of the word blame, feels and has felt, very bad,'' he said. But he insisted his brother had nothing to apologise for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I don't think people who are forthcoming and forthright in what they do and believe they're doing the right thing should then go back,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Justice Department has responded to appeals to probe whether Zimmerman committed any civil rights violations in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, book agent Sharlene Martin confirmed today that one of the jurors is to write a book explaining the verdict, claiming she was contacted by juror B-37 the day after the verdict and signed her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The reader will learn why jurors had no option but to find Zimmerman not guilty due to the manner in which he was charged and the content of the jury instructions,'' Martin said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman could face federal civil rights charges under the 2009 Matthew Shepard Act, which makes bodily injury a federal crime if &quot;committed because of the actual or perceived race, colour, religion, national origin of any person.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the surface, this clearly phrased law would seem to make conviction relatively straightforward. All the prosecution would have to do is show that Zimmerman's attack on [Trayvon] Martin was racially motivated,&quot; writes Noah Feldman, a Harvard law professor. &quot;yet how, exactly, would the federal government prove Zimmerman's motivation? Testimony from a former coworker who claims that Zimmerman made racist, anti-Arab comments on the job would likely not be admissible. Zimmerman's possible racial slur on the tape of his conversation with the 911 operator while following Martin (arguably, &quot;coon&quot;) might conceivably be admitted as probative. But a single phrase that is difficult to interpret on the tape is unlikely to be enough to convince a jury that Martin's race was the cause for the attack.... And one jury already apparently bought some version of the self-defence story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing for Bloomberg News, Mr. Feldman said trouble could arise if Mr. Zimmerman were acquitted again. &quot;Instead of the bottom-line message being that the government wants to protect all its citizens from hate crimes, events might underscore that in 2013, a white-appearing American can still shoot an unarmed African-American teenager and get away with it not once but twice. One acquittal could perhaps be explained away by the vagaries of the jury system or the particularities of the culture of self-defence as symbolized by Florida's standyour-ground law. A second acquittal would mean something different. Because the charge would be that Zimmerman acted with racial animus, the verdict might be perceived as saying that the public didn't believe race was in issue here at all - or worse, that the public didn't care.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney-General eric Holder, in his first remarks since George Zimmerman was cleared of state charges in the fatal shooting of black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, called the killing an opportunity to have a &quot;difficult dialogue&quot; on racially charged issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Holder, whose Justice department is still considering whether to bring civil rights charges against Mr. Zimmerman, said the killing was a &quot;tragic, unnecessary shooting death.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised,&quot; Mr. Holder said in a speech to the national convention of the delta Sigma Theta sorority in Washington. &quot;We must not - as we have too often in the past - let this opportunity pass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are resolved, as you are, to combat violence involving or directed at young people, to prevent future tragedies and to deal with the underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs and stereotypes that serve as the basis for these too common incidents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Mr. Holder travels to Florida to address the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The organization has circulated a petition calling on the Justice department to file charges against Mr. Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors who tried Mr. Zimmerman, 29, said the case was never about race. But in the aftermath of Mr. Zimmerman being found not guilty of second-degree murder, race is the dominant theme at play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, thousands demonstrated throughout the country with signs saying &quot;Justice for Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a march and rally in downtown Chicago, some said the verdict was symbolic of lingering racism in the united States. Seventy-three-year-old Maya Miller said the case reminded her of the 1955 slaying of emmitt Till, a 14-yearold from Chicago who was murdered by a group of white men while visiting Mississippi. emmitt's killing galvanized the civil rights movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fifty-eight years and nothing's changed,&quot; Ms. Miller said. Rand Powdrill, 41, of San Leandro, marched in San Francisco to &quot;protest the execution of an innocent black teenager.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Holder, the country's first black attorney-general, began an investigation in March 2012, the month after the death of Mr. Martin, 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial,&quot; the Justice department said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But such a case would be difficult to bring, according to former federal prosecutors in the department's civil rights division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samuel Bagenstos, the former No. 2 official in the Justice department's civil rights division under Mr. Holder, said that based on what he has seen, it would be &quot;very difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; that Mr. Zimmerman was motivated by race when he followed and, after a fight, eventually killed Mr. Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To prove what's on somebody's mind is always difficult,&quot; said Mr. Bagenstos, now a law professor at the university of Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To prove what's on somebody's mind in a fight that took place between two people, one of whom is dead, the other of whom doesn't have to testify and with no other witnesses around to hear what he has to say, is very, very difficult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don West, one of Mr. Zimmerman's attorneys, said he did not &quot;think the federal investigation will develop into any sort of charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Absolutely nothing would suggest that this was a hate crime in any way whatsoever,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors alleged Mr. Zimmerman, whose father is white and mother is Hispanic, profiled Mr. Martin as a criminal suspect, then followed and confronted him, leading to the altercation in which the unarmed youth was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyers argued Mr. Zimmerman acted in self-defence, fearing for his life after Mr. Martin punched him in the face, knocked him to the ground and then pounded his head against the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman told police he drew the legally concealed nine-millimetre pistol he carried after Mr. Martin told him &quot;you're going to die tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-woman jury on Saturday found Mr. Zimmerman not guilty of murder or the lesser possible charge of manslaughter for shooting Mr. Martin through the heart during a struggle at the townhouse complex where the youth was staying at the home of his father's girlfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama, while acknowledging the case has &quot;elicited strong passions&quot; called on the country to &quot;respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken,&quot; Mr. Obama said in a statement Sunday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, United States</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama has appealed to Americans for restraint amid anger from civil rights activists and public protests against the acquittal of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury late on Saturday found neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, after a long and racially-charged trial that transfixed much of the United States for weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, we are ecstatic. George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defence,&quot; said his lead attorney Mark O'Mara after the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second degree murder, having pursued Martin, 17, through a gated community in the town of Sanford, eventually shooting him during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial aroused strong passions and divided those who believed that Zimmerman, whose father is white and whose mother is Peruvian, had racially-profiled Martin, and those who believed he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spontaneous protests broke out in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta overnight, following the verdict, though they were mostly peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, a large demonstration in New York attracted several thousand people, with placards that read, &quot;Jail racist killers, not black youth&quot;, and &quot;We are all Trayvon. The whole damn system is guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the marchers in lower Manhattan wore a T-shirt proclaiming: &quot;I'm black. Please don't shoot?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyonce called at a concert for a moment of silence for Martin. Rapper Young Jeezy released a song in Martin's memory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rand Powdrill, 41, said he came to the San Francisco march with about 400 others to &quot;protest the execution of an innocent black teenager. If our voices can't be heard, then this is just going to keep going on&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Obama, the first black US president, urged people to accept the trial verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,&quot; Obama said in a statement. &quot;I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in Oakland, California, protesters had smashed windows and spray painted cars after the verdict was announced live on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement yesterday, the Justice Department said the criminal section of its civil rights division, the FBI and the local US Attorney's office are continuing to evaluate the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department has a long history of using federal civil rights law in an effort to convict defendants who have previously been acquitted in related state cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But experience has shown it's almost never easy getting convictions in such high-profile prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Vinegrad, a former US attorney, said federal prosecutors &quot;would have to show not only that the attack was unjustified, but that Mr Zimmerman attacked Mr Martin because of his race and because he was using a public facility, the street&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court did not release the racial and ethnic makeup of the six-person jury, but the panel appeared to reporters to be made up of five white women and a sixth who may be Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors did not talk to reporters after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the president tied the killing of the teenager to the problems surrounding gun use in the United States, an issue in which he tried but failed to push through new control measures in the US Congress earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how #124we can prevent future tragedies #124like this. As citizens, that's a #124job for all of us. That's the way to honour Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida police initially declined to press charges against Zimmerman, sparking mass protests. He was eventually arrested in April 2012 and charged with second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing has also resonated with those who call for stricter gun laws, including New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who issued a statement against what he called &quot;shoot-first laws&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sadly, all the facts in this tragic case will probably never be known. But one fact has long been crystal clear: 'shoot first' laws like those in Florida can inspire dangerous vigilantism and protect those who act recklessly with guns,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Memories of the deadly April 1992 riots in Los Angeles, which broke out after a similarly racially-tinged case, still linger among US law enforcement officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearing violence after the Zimmerman verdict, police were out in force in Sanford, and the crowd of several hundred outside the courthouse was loud at times, but not violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A racial divide, however, was evident in Sanford pastor Valerie Houston's sermon on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dr [Martin Luther] King [Jr] stated, the daily life of the Negro is still in the basement of the Great Society,&quot; she said. &quot;And today I state, the daily life of my people is still enslaved to a white supremacist society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents, father and mother had before the trial asked the public to respect the outcome and afterward gave thanks for the outpouring of support they received over the past year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US President Barack Obama appealed for calm as thousands of demonstrators from across the country staged protests against a jury's decision to acquit neighbourhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rallies were largely peaceful as demonstrators voiced their support for 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family and decried the verdict. Police in Los Angeles said they arrested six people, mostly for failure to disperse, after about 80 protesters gathered in Hollywood on Sunset Boulevard. New York police said at least a dozen people were arrested on disorderly conduct charges during a rally at Times Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slain teen's parents used social media to thank supporters following Saturday's verdict in the Florida murder trial of Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued by the White House, President Obama urged Americans to respect the justice system. &quot;The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a tragedy. Not just for his family or for any one community, but for America. I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,&quot; he said. &quot;But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot; &quot;I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from the two parents who lost their young son. And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities. We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this. As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honour Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates want federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman who was acquitted Saturday in Martin's shooting death. Al-Sharpton, a prominent civil rights leader, said on Monday that his organisation would hold vigils and rallies in 100 cities in front of federal buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department has said it's considering whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges against Zimmerman who has been acquitted in the state case. The department opened an investigation into Martin's death last year, but stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's demonstrations, held in cities from Florida to Wisconsin, attracted from a few dozen to more than a thousand. In New York City, more than 1,000 people marched into Times Square, zigzagging through Manhattan's streets to avoid police lines. Sign-carrying marchers thronged the busy intersection, chanting &quot;Justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin!&quot; as they made their way from downtown Union Square, blocking traffic for more than an hour. In San Francisco and Los Angeles, police dispersed an earlier protest with beanbag rounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti urged protesters to practise peace. Later, more than 100 officers converged and ordered people to disperse. A handful of people were given citations, mostly for blocking a street or jaywalking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, at Manhattan's Middle Collegiate Church, many congregants wore hooded sweatshirts similar to the one Martin was wearing the night he was shot. In Miami, more than 200 people gathered. &quot;You can't justify murder,&quot; read one poster. Another read, &quot;Don't worry about more riots. Worry about more Zimmermans.&quot; In Philadelphia, about 700 protesters marched through downtown to Liberty Bell, alternating between chanting Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's name and &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; In Atlanta, about 75 protesters chanted and carried signs near Centennial Olympic Park.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict is frustrating, fracturing, angering and predictable. More than anything, for many of us, it is exhausting. Exhausting because nothing could bring back our lost child, exhausting because the verdict, which should have felt shocking, arrived with the inevitability that black Americans know too well when criminal law announces that they are worth less than other Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers on both sides argued repeatedly that this case was never about race, but only whether prosecutors proved beyond a reasonable doubt that George Zimmerman was not simply defending himself when he shot Mr. Martin. And, indeed, race was only whispered in the incomplete invocation that Mr. Zimmerman had ''profiled'' Mr. Martin. But what this case reveals in its overall shape is precisely what the law is unable to see in its narrow focus on the details. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anger felt by so many African-Americans speaks to the simplest of truths: that race and law cannot be cleanly separated. We are tired of hearing that race is a conversation for another day. We are tired of pretending that ''reasonable doubt'' is not, in every sense of the word, colored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every step Mr. Martin took toward the end of his too-short life was defined by his race. I do not have to believe that Mr. Zimmerman is a hate-filled racist to recognize that he would probably not even have noticed Mr. Martin if he had been a casually dressed white teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But because Mr. Martin was one of those ''punks'' who ''always get away,'' as Mr. Zimmerman characterized him in a call to the police, Mr. Zimmerman felt he was justified in following him. After all, a young black man matched the criminal descriptions, not just in local police reports, but in those most firmly lodged in Mr. Zimmerman's imagination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the law judges Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's behavior to be reasonable is also deeply colored by race. Imagine that a militant black man, with a history of race-based suspicion and a loaded gun, followed an unarmed white teenager around his neighborhood. The young man is scared, and runs through the streets trying to get away. Unable to elude his black stalker and, perhaps, feeling cornered, he finally holds his ground -- only to be shot at point-blank range after a confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would we throw up our hands, unable to conclude what really happened? Would we struggle to find a reasonable doubt about whether the shooter acted in self-defense? A young, white Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would unquestionably be said to have behaved reasonably, while it is unimaginable that a militant, black George Zimmerman would not be viewed as the legal aggressor, and thus guilty of at least manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is about more than one case. Our reasons for presuming, profiling and acting are always deeply racialized, and the Zimmerman trial, in ignoring that, left those reasons unexplored and unrefuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is reasonable to do, especially in the dark of night, is defined by preconceived social roles that paint young black men as potential criminals and predators. Black men, the narrative dictates, are dangerous, to be watched and put down at the first false move. This pain is one all black men know; putting away the tie you wear to the office means peeling off the assumption that you are owed equal respect. Mr. Martin's hoodie struck the deepest chord because we know that daring to wear jeans and a hooded sweatshirt too often means that the police or other citizens are judged to be reasonable in fearing you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know this, yet every time a case like this offers a chance for the country to tackle the evil of racial discrimination in our criminal law, courts have deliberately silenced our ability to expose it. The Supreme Court has held that even if your race is what makes your actions suspicious to the police, their suspicions are reasonable so long as an officer can later construct a race-neutral narrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, our death penalty cases have long presaged the Zimmerman verdict, exposing how racial disparities, which make a white life more valuable, do not undermine the constitutionality of the death sentence. And even the most casual observer recognizes the painful racial disparities in our prison population -- the new Jim Crow, in the account of the legal scholar Michelle Alexander. Our prisons are full of young, black men for whom guilty beyond a reasonable doubt was easy enough to reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no quick answer for the historical use of our criminal law to reinforce and then punish social stereotypes. But pretending that reasonable doubt is a value-free clinical term, as so many people did so readily in the Zimmerman case, only insulates injustice in plain sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without an honest jurisprudence that is brave enough to tackle the way race infuses our criminal law, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's voice will be silenced again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What would such a jurisprudence look like? The Supreme Court could hold, for example, that the unjustified use of race by the police in determining ''reasonable suspicion'' constituted an unreasonable stop, tainting captured evidence. Likewise, in the same way we have started to attack racial disparities in other areas of criminal law, we could consider it a violation of someone's constitutional rights if, controlling for all else, his race was what determined whether the state executed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can imagine a jurisprudence that at least begins to use racial disparities as a tool to question the constitutionality of criminal punishment. And above all, I can imagine a jurisprudence that does not pretend, as lawyers for both sides (but no one else) did in the Zimmerman case, that doubts have no color.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Driving to Target on his Sunday grocery run on Feb. 26, 2012, George Zimmerman looked out the window of his S.U.V. and saw a stranger who he instantly concluded was ''a real suspicious guy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Punks,'' he said, adding an expletive. ''They always get away.'' There were unsolved burglaries in his community, and as he said in a call he made to the police, ''this guy looks like he's up to no good.'' Mr. Zimmerman's recorded profanity-laden police call became a focal point at his murder trial, but not because of its obvious significance: that Mr. Zimmerman jumped to insulting conclusions about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin primarily on account of Mr. Martin's race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What began as a local crime story gained national attention after African-American journalists and civil rights leaders immediately grasped the racial implications of the confrontation between Mr. Zimmerman and Mr. Martin, and ended with Mr. Martin's death. Mr. Zimmerman's acquittal on Saturday sparked nationwide civil demonstrations against racial profiling and hate crimes. But in the courtroom, race was a topic carefully controlled by the judge and handled awkwardly by the prosecution team. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an odd ruling, Judge Debra Nelson decided that the word ''profiling'' -- but not the phrase ''racial profiling'' -- could be used in opening statements. But what other kind of profiling could possibly have been involved here? Could jurors -- and the public -- seriously imagine that Mr. Zimmerman considered Mr. Martin a criminal solely because he was walking slowly in the rain as he chatted on the phone? Lawyers were free to use the profanity involved in the case over and over again, but initially the ''r'' word was off limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly thereafter, it seemed the prosecution was building its case, at least partly, around Mr. Zimmerman's obvious racial profiling, which was the run-up for the altercation and shooting that followed. The state fought hard outside the jury's presence to enter into evidence police calls Mr. Zimmerman had made in the months before the shooting; 100 percent of the calls about suspicious persons involved African-Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the judge ultimately granted the state's request and admitted tapes of these calls into evidence, the prosecution did not use the evidence and remained strangely silent on Mr. Zimmerman's pattern of racial profiling during its two closing arguments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To those who followed the trial closely, as I did, it seemed a decision was made midstream to abandon the strategy that included calling attention to Mr. Zimmerman's pattern. Prosecutors apparently trusted jurors to dispassionately evaluate photos of a dead teenager's remains and of the bullet hole through his heart as well as photos of blood dripping from George Zimmerman's head. But the state was too squeamish to put the touchy issue of race squarely before the six-woman jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense was far more comfortable with the disturbing racial aspects of the case, and as one of its final witnesses called a young white mother who had been robbed in the neighborhood months before the shooting. The witness, Olivia Bertalan, testified that she had cowered in her closet, baby in her arms, as two African-American males burglarized her home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What did that have to do with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin? The prosecution never asked. Was Mr. Martin inherently suspicious because he was of the same race as the burglars -- the clear import of this story? To attribute the wrongs of two African-American men to all African-Americans is the definition of racism. But the prosecutor never said so in court or called the jury's attention to this fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his closing argument, Mark O'Mara, one of Mr. Zimmerman's lawyers, drove home the idea that Mr. Zimmerman's profane police call was reasonable, arguing that Mr. Zimmerman's descriptions of Mr. Martin and the burglars ''did match the description, unfortunately, and that's just maybe happenstance.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other than race and youth, no other description of the burglars was admitted into evidence. Race and youth were the sole basis of what defense lawyers deemed ''a match.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state did not question any of this, much less point out that racial profiling was not happenstance but a way to filter out all other, nonracial, identifying factors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How tall were the Bertalan burglars? Did they have any noticeable tattoos, facial features, haircuts, manner of speaking, gait, clothing? Had they been seen walking slowly in the rain, talking on the phone? The burglars' and Mr. Martin's mutual blackness obscured all else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the defense logic, all young African-American males in the neighborhood would warrant a call to the police for walking while black -- this in a racially diverse, middle-class community that is 20 percent African-American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most discordant note in the entire three-week trial came in the prosecution's rebuttal closing argument, its last chance to drive its points home with the jury. John Guy, a prosecutor in the case, insisted forcefully that the case was not about race; relying on a strategy reminiscent of John Grisham's book ''A Time to Kill,'' Mr. Guy asked the jury to consider a role reversal: would Martin be convicted if he had followed and then shot George Zimmerman? After this obvious, if implicit, reference to race, Mr. Guy finished up by reminding the jury that the case was not about race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Huh?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Martin's family, too, wavered on the subject. Mr. Guy's remarks mirrored those made by Benjamin Crump, the Martin family lawyer, who said in September that the case ''shouldn't be about race,'' though if the roles of the two young men were reversed, an arrest would have occurred quickly. (Mr. Crump had concluded with ''that's why race is involved in this case.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And after Mr. Martin's friend Rachel Jeantel testified to the only racial epithet uttered in the courtroom -- Mr. Martin's characterization of Mr. Zimmerman as a ''creepy-ass cracker'' -- another family attorney stood alongside Mr. Martin's parents at a news conference and said, ''To this family, race is not a part of this process. Anybody who tries to inject race into it is wrong.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Mr. Martin's parents had traveled to Washington to attend a Congressional forum on racial profiling and hate crimes, which resulted in the Congressional Black Caucus's describing the killing as one of ''racial bias.'' And in March 2012 Tracy Martin had said, ''For the Sanford Police Department to feel as though they were going to sweep another young black minority death under the rug, it's an atrocity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many disturbing factors were present in the Zimmerman trial: his legal right to drive to the grocery store with a loaded concealed weapon, bullet chambered; Florida's overly permissive self-defense laws; subpar crime-scene evidence-collection techniques; the oddly arrogant medical examiner who had little interest in answering the questions posed to him by counsel; the prosecutors' apparent failure to adequately prepare their key witness, Ms. Jeantel; prosecutors' failure to emphasize how Mr. Zimmerman's gun, holstered behind him and inside his waistband, could not have been seen and reached for by Mr. Martin in the scenario Mr. Zimmerman described, where he was pinned on his back with Mr. Martin assaulting him; prosecutors' failure to drive home the fact that Mr. Zimmerman's claim that Mr. Martin pounded his head on concrete in his final moments did not fit the crime scene, since Mr. Martin's body was found on the grass a substantial distance from any concrete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution's most glaring trial failure was its absence of a theory about what happened on the night of the shooting that would counter the defense's frightening story about Mr. Martin's pinning Mr. Zimmerman to the ground, straddling him and banging his head against the concrete and then reaching for Mr. Zimmerman's gun. The defense seized upon the prosecution's unusual practice throughout the trial, and especially in closing, of simply raising questions of what might have happened, rather than proving its own case or presenting its own theory about the facts. When both sides seemed to advocate for reasonable doubt, an acquittal was the only possible outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It cannot reasonably be disputed that the incident that left Mr. Martin dead began with ugly racial profiling. But the prosecution seemed afraid to say so at any point in the trial. Instead, the state appeared to want to tread lightly on the jurors' presumed delicate sensibilities on the dicey subject of race and, leaving the race question aside, simply pointed out that Mr. Zimmerman must have made ''assumptions.'' The state's refusal to take an aggressive, clear position on Mr. Zimmerman's racial profiling was, like many of its strategic decisions, a clear fumble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the final photos the defense showed to the jury was a 7-Eleven surveillance camera image of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin an hour before his death, the kind of blurry photo one sees on the local news when the police are searching for a holdup suspect. This was the person George Zimmerman encountered, counsel insisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the following night, Mr. Zimmerman was acquitted. Afterward, smiling broadly after her team had just lost the case, Angela B. Corey, the special prosecutor, said: ''This case has never been about race.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a way, the not-guilty verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman for his killing of Trayvon Martin was more powerful than a guilty verdict could ever have been. It was the perfect wrenching coda to a story that illustrates just how utterly and completely our system of justice -- both moral and legal -- failed Martin and his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to dispute the jury's finding -- one can intellectually rationalize the decision -- as much as it is to howl at the moon, to yearn for a brighter reality for the politics around dark bodies, to raise a voice and say, this case is a rallying call, not a death dirge. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system began to fail Martin long before that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system failed him when Florida's self-defense laws were written, allowing an aggressor to claim self-defense in the middle of an altercation -- and to use deadly force in that defense -- with no culpability for his role in the events that led to that point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system failed him because of the disproportionate force that he and the neighborhood watchman could legally bring to the altercation -- Zimmerman could legally carry a concealed firearm, while Martin, who was only 17, could not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system failed him when the neighborhood watchman grafted on stereotypes the moment he saw him, ascribing motive and behavior and intent and criminal history to a boy who was just walking home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system failed him when the bullet ripped though his chest, and the man who shot him said he mounted him and stretched his arms out wide, preventing him from even clutching the spot that hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system failed him in those moments just after he was shot when he was surely aware that he was about to die, but before life's light fully passed from his body -- and no one came to comfort him or try to save him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system failed him when the slapdash Sanford police did a horrible job of collecting and preserving evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system failed him when those officers apparently didn't even value his dead body enough to adequately canvass the complex to make sure that no one was missing a teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system failed him when he was labeled a John Doe and his lifeless body spent the night alone and unclaimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system failed him when the man who the police found standing over the body of a dead teenager, a man who admitted to shooting him and still had the weapon, was taken in for questioning and then allowed to walk out of the precinct without an arrest or even a charge, to go home after taking a life and take to his bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system failed him when it took more than 40 days and an outpouring of national outrage to get an arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system failed him when a strangely homogenous jury -- who may well have been Zimmerman's peers but were certainly not the peers of the teenager, who was in effect being tried in absentia -- was seated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system failed him when the prosecution put on a case for the Martin family that many court-watchers found wanting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system failed him when the discussion about bias became so reductive as to be either-or rather than about situational fluidity and the possibility of varying responses to varying levels of perceived threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system failed him when everyone in the courtroom raised racial bias in roundabout ways, but almost never directly -- for example, when the defense held up a picture of a shirtless Martin and told the jurors that this was the person Zimmerman encountered the night he shot him. But in fact it was not the way Zimmerman had seen Martin. Consciously or subconsciously, the defense played on an old racial trope: asking the all-female jury -- mostly white -- to fear the image of the glistening black buck, as Zimmerman had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is not about an extraordinary death of an extraordinary person. Unfortunately, in America, people are lost to gun violence every day. Many of them look like Martin and have parents who presumably grieve for them. This case is about extraordinary inequality in the presumption of innocence and the application of justice: why was Martin deemed suspicious and why was his killer allowed to go home?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes people just need a focal point. Sometimes that focal point becomes a breaking point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of universal suspicion without individual evidence is what Americans find abhorrent and what black men in America must constantly fight. It is pervasive in policing policies -- like stop-and-frisk, and in this case neighborhood watch -- regardless of the collateral damage done to the majority of innocents. It's like burning down a house to rid it of mice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a parent, particularly a parent of black teenage boys, I am left with the question, ''Now, what do I tell my boys?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We used to say not to run in public because that might be seen as suspicious, like they'd stolen something. But according to Zimmerman, Martin drew his suspicion at least in part because he was walking too slowly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what do I tell my boys now? At what precise pace should a black man walk to avoid suspicion?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And can they ever stop walking away, or running away, and simply stand their ground? Can they become righteously indignant without being fatally wounded?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is there anyplace safe enough, or any cargo innocent enough, for a black man in this country? Martin was where he was supposed to be -- in a gated community -- carrying candy and a canned drink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole system failed Martin. What prevents it from failing my children, or yours?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I feel that I must tell my boys that, but I can't. It's stuck in my throat. It's an impossibly heartbreaking conversation to have. So, I sit and watch in silence, and occasionally mouth the word, ''breathe,'' because I keep forgetting to.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI -- George Zimmerman was guilty of nothing more than ''bad judgment,'' one of six jurors to find the neighborhood watchman not guilty said Monday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror, the first to share her story publicly, spoke anonymously, telling Anderson Cooper of CNN that she believed Mr. Zimmerman's account that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin attacked him. Fearing for his life, Mr. Zimmerman had no choice but to shoot the teenager, the juror said. Mr. Martin was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think his heart was in the right place,'' the juror said of Mr. Zimmerman's eagerness to try to protect the neighborhood. ''It just went terribly wrong.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said later, ''It pretty much happened the way George said it happened.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37, the number she was assigned for the trial, also said that when the six jurors first began to deliberate, they were evenly divided between guilt and innocence. One voted for second-degree murder and two voted for manslaughter. B37 said she was one of three who initially voted ''not guilty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There was a couple of them in there that wanted to find him guilty of something,'' the juror said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after sorting through the evidence and Mr. Zimmerman's account, the three jurors changed their minds. Second-degree murder was discarded first. Then, after much confusion over the jury instructions, manslaughter was also set aside, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors, who gave their verdict Saturday, concluded that Mr. Zimmerman acted in self-defense, she said. ''I have no doubt George feared for his life,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the swirl of anger and passion over the role of race outside the courtroom, race did not come up during 16 hours and 20 minutes of deliberations, she said. No juror, she said, viewed the case through the prism of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Mr. Martin was black did not drive Mr. Zimmerman to suspect and follow him, she said. It was the overall situation -- he was cutting through the back, the townhouse complex had been hit by a rash of burglaries, and Mr. Martin appeared to be walking aimlessly in the rain, looking in houses, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think he just profiled him because he was the neighborhood watch and he profiled anybody who came in and saw them acting strange,'' she said, regardless of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror also said that she and most of the other jurors believed Mr. Zimmerman was the one screaming for help during the recording of a resident's 911 call because he was the one being beaten. An ''important'' piece of evidence, she called it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It was a long cry and scream for help -- whoever was crying for help was in fear for their life,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For whatever reason, Mr. Martin, she said, decided to confront Mr. Zimmerman and threw the first punch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Trayvon got mad and attacked him,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror also said that Rachel Jeantel, Mr. Martin's friend who spoke to him on the phone moments before he was killed, was ''not a good witness.'' The juror said Ms. Jeantel ''clearly didn't want to be there.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly sympathetic to Mr. Zimmerman, the juror, who is married to a lawyer and has two grown children, referred to him as George. The juror, who has signed with a literary agent with the intent of writing a book, said she felt sorry for Mr. Zimmerman and for Mr. Martin, calling the situation a ''tragedy.'' The six women became very emotional, she said, immediately after they handed their verdict to the bailiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's just sad that we all had to come together and figure out what is going to happen to this man's life afterwards,'' she said. ''You find him not guilty, but you are responsible for that not guilty, and all the people who want him guilty aren't going to have any closure.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SARA BAREILLES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Blessed Unrest'' (Epic)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sara Bareilles sings ''Manhattan'' with heavy exhaustion, like a woman beaten down by the marathon she's just finished. ''You can have Manhattan, I know it's for the best,'' she exhales, over a dark, slow-moving piano, redolent of the early, elegantly pugnacious Billy Joel. ''I'll gather up the avenues and leave them on your doorstep/And I'll tiptoe away so you won't have to say you heard me leave.'' She's not snide or colorfully melodramatic -- just spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the fourth song on ''The Blessed Unrest,'' her new album, and it speaks loudly. It especially shouts down the songs that precede it, which -- including the single ''Brave'' -- are booming and jangly, songs that announce in scale what Ms. Bareilles's sweet and sometimes nervy voice doesn't always do on its own. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, it's a surprise that Ms. Bareilles's best song on this album is her most morose. She's never matched the pep of her 2007 debut single, ''Love Song,'' a song about what sort of song she's unwilling to write. That theme -- writing about writing -- re-emerges on the first couple of songs of this album, like an early college writing experiment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The album is suffused with that kind of seriousness -- not the emotional sort, as on ''Manhattan,'' but the stylistic sort. Worse, ''The Blessed Unrest'' isn't as smilingly eclectic as her better earlier work, especially the often masterly ''Kaleidoscope Heart,'' from 2010. Those albums bore traces of cabaret, girl-group pop, college a cappella groups -- a whole host of future karaoke repertory -- and were built around Ms. Bareilles's good cheer, which buoys her even in down moods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, ''The Blessed Unrest'' is all shoulder-drooping heft, and her musical choices are vexing. On ''Hercules,'' she's Fiona Apple manqu&eacute;e, and barely that; ''Eden'' conveys early Madonna, of all things; and ''Islands'' suggests that Enya may have popped up on Ms. Bareilles's iTunes shuffle with some regularity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Bareilles is hiding behind styles that aren't her own. Only on ''Little Black Dress'' does that strategy pay off. It sounds like an Amy Winehouse sketch, with a zippy horn-led arrangement. Vocally, Ms. Bareilles sounds bright, too, and comfortable -- doing her familiar trick of making the melancholy chirp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JON CARAMANICA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GEORGE DUKE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''DreamWeaver''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Heads Up International)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tucked away near the end of George Duke's new album is a track called ''Burnt Sausage Jam,'' which sprawls out over an intense and soulful 15 minutes. Featuring Mr. Duke on keyboards, Jef Lee Johnson on guitar, Christian McBride on electric bass and John Roberts on drums, it's an in-the-pocket tune that meanders to a few unexpected places. It has an abrupt beginning, a false ending and a convincingly live feel, down to the crisp solos from all involved. It's unfocused but oddly riveting -- and that's before it segues into the album's straight-faced valediction, a gospel cover of ''Happy Trails.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's reason to cheer any sign of loose digression from Mr. Duke, who at 67 has comfortably settled into his role as a sage of jazz-funk, smooth R&amp;B and various other crossover hybrids. ''DreamWeaver'' is a typically all-over-the-map effort for him, complete with a post-Parliament freakout jam (''Ashtray''), some cooled-out cosmic fusion (''Brown Sneakers'') and a smoldering near-bossa nova (''Stones of Orion''). A track called ''Trippin' '' has him singing about his early exposure to jazz, in what feels partly like a testimonial and partly like a therapy session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''DreamWeaver'' is Mr. Duke's first album since the death of his wife, Corine, last year. That loss hangs heavily over ''Missing You,'' a slow jam with Rachelle Ferrell on lead vocal, which begins with an uncomfortably earnest voice-over by Mr. Duke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bit less wrenchingly, the album also pays tribute to Mr. Johnson, the guitarist, who died this year, and the soul and R&amp;B singer Teena Marie, who died in 2010. A track called ''Ball &amp; Chain'' represents one of Ms. Marie's final recordings, and despite some indifferent lyrics, it's a strong and sinuous performance; Mr. Duke is good at making those happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's a little less good at filtering out the clunkier aspects of his music. The low point here is a treacly pop ballad called ''Change the World,'' featuring a small army of guest vocalists, like BeBe Winans, Lalah Hathaway and Freddie Jackson. (There's no danger of confusing it with the identically titled Eric Clapton hit, or with Michael Jackson's ''Heal the World.'') Nearly as cringeworthy, for different reasons, is ''Round the Way Girl,'' which casts Mr. Duke as a leering old man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So skip those, and seek out the moments on ''DreamWeaver'' that ratify Mr. Duke's mastery with vintage synthesizers: a Prophet 5, an Arp Odyssey, a Minimoog, a clavinet. Or head straight to a Latin ballad called ''You Never Know,'' which illuminates his stature among next-wave fusionistas like Thundercat and Flying Lotus. Mr. Duke does some of his best singing on that track, in a breathy but urgent falsetto, and his message of uncertainty is poignant. ''Embrace the cold, go through the rain,'' he sings. ''Accept the things we cannot change.'' NATE CHINEN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACE HOOD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Trials &amp; Tribulations''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(We the Best/Cash Money/Universal Republic)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's been no greater act of hip-hop bandwagoneering this year than Ace Hood's ''Bugatti.'' It's a surge of triumphalism from a rapper who doesn't appear to have earned it, but what carries the song is the hook, by Future, which sounds as if it were melting out of the speakers, in that characteristic Future way. This isn't Future at his most creative, but the digitally decaying voice is there -- it's a gift, and it does the work so that Ace Hood doesn't have to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is Ace Hood's biggest hit in a five-year career, and what does he do with the currency that a success of this scale has earned him? Unexpectedly, he makes the most socially conscious mainstream rap album of the year thus far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Granted, this is a preposterously low bar in 2013. The end-zone dance that is ''Bugatti'' is far more in keeping with hip-hop's prevailing mood, and half of this album tries to match it but falls short. But most of the rest of ''Trials &amp; Tribulations'' is far darker and more reflective -- it's music for bad moods and self-doubt. Turns out that Ace Hood is obsessed with poverty, redemption, broken families, religiosity, Trayvon Martin and Emmett Till. Plenty of rappers give lip service to the same things but usually as a means to celebrating overcoming long odds. On songs like ''Another Statistic,'' ''Hope'' and ''The Come Up,'' Ace Hood sounds happy to be mired in the difficult stuff. They sound as if they were teleported in from the early 1990s, when there wasn't shame in struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Ace Hood is occasionally a nimble rapper, he's rarely an effective one. He raps quickly in a thick, gluey voice, with little tonal variance, like endlessly striking one key on the piano. This is his fourth album, a milestone many better rappers haven't reached, but he has the blessing of powerful benefactors: DJ Khaled, to whose label he is signed, and now the Cash Money cartel, including Birdman and Lil Wayne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps without that baggage he'd be received as a more complex figure, something other than a mere minor leaguer looking to graduate to the bigs. But it's only that baggage that's gotten him this far. After all, all moguls need charitable write-offs. JON CARAMANICA</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite breaking late on a weekend evening, the verdict in the murder trial of George Zimmerman attracted an audience of more than 10 million viewers to cable news networks, a huge total for a Saturday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preliminary ratings showed that for the hour from 10 to 11 p.m., just after the verdict came in, Fox News and CNN each attracted well over three million viewers, while MSNBC trailed badly with only about 1.3 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox had the highest number, 3.68 million viewers, just ahead of CNN with 3.4 million. But CNN outpaced Fox News among the viewers that television advertisers pay most to reach, those between the ages of 25 and 54. In that category, CNN had 1.72 million viewers to 1.11 million for Fox News. MSNBC had only 510,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSNBC actually finished in fourth place over all, also coming in behind CNN's sister network HLN, which is known for covering criminal trials. HLN had 2.2 million total viewers for third in that category and 980,000 in the 25-54 group, which also placed it third.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The viewership total of 10 million represented a major increase from the Saturday night audience a week earlier, when only about 1.6 million viewers watched the same four cable news channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pew Research Center released a study Monday on public interest in the Zimmerman trial, labeling the level of national interest only modest, despite the near wall-to-wall coverage that the trial received over the past several weeks on the cable news channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the survey, 26 percent of respondents said they had watched news about the trial closely. Interest was much higher in March 2012, when news of the shooting of Trayvon Martin was heavily covered. At that time, 35 percent said they were following the event closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pew also found that interest broke sharply along racial lines, with 56 percent of black respondents saying they were following the trial closely, as opposed to only 20 percent of whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pew reported that some other racially charged news events it had studied showed higher national percentages of close interest, including the arrest of O. J. Simpson in 1994 (48 percent) and the riots that followed the acquittal of police officers accused of assaulting Rodney King in 1992 (70 percent).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- Monday dawned as quietly as Sunday did in this sleepy small Central Florida city. The streets of Goldsboro, the historic black community, were all but empty. Downtown was tumbleweed still. A few miles from the county courthouse, in Mel's Family Diner, waitresses served up signature dishes -- sissy burgers and biker omelets -- and voiced tentative relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all the preparations for violent outbursts and repeated entreaties from pastors for calm, people here did not riot -- and barely protested -- in these days after the acquittal late Saturday of George Zimmerman, the man whose deadly encounter with an unarmed black teenager, Trayvon Martin, brought the city infamy almost a year and a half ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having been swamped by tens of thousands of protesters last year demanding Mr. Zimmerman's arrest, the city tensed as the verdict approached. Extra police officers went on patrol. Grocery stores hired more security guards. Convenience store clerks asked to be allowed to leave early when a verdict was near. One of the waitresses at Mel's, who is white and did not want to be identified, only half-jokingly asked black friends if she could hide in their attic ''if anything happens.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict came Saturday night: jurors accepted Mr. Zimmerman's claim that he shot Mr. Martin in self-defense. The teenager's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, were ''heartbroken and devastated,'' their lead lawyer said. Mr. Zimmerman's whereabouts remain unknown to the public, and as of late Monday, according to his defense team, he had not collected the gun used in the episode, which the court had ordered released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As protests over the verdict unfolded across the country, it became clear in Sanford that the widely forecast unrest was unlikely to come to pass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We might be angry about the verdict,'' said Larry Williams, 55, as he sat in the air-conditioned chill of his friend's barbershop in Goldsboro on Monday. ''But why go out and do anything you would not want to do?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, on Monday, people carried on, some with heavier hearts than others. Shauna Rollf, 24, who works at the Taste of Thyme Cafe, said business was lighter than normal because Sanford residents were avoiding all the reporters and camera crews prowling through downtown. Like others, she was awaiting the day the news media swarm left. ''I think everybody's kind of exhausted,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few blocks away, a dozen pastors, city officials and perhaps a hundred residents, black and white, filed into the New Life Word Center Church for a noontime prayer service. They prayed for peace and racial reconciliation, and they prayed for the Zimmerman and Martin families. ''God, we realize there is no winner in this situation,'' one pastor said, as those gathered raised their hands heavenward, crying out, ''That's right.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new police chief, Cecil E. Smith, also spoke from the altar, praising the town. ''Everybody wants us to go out and act up,'' he said. ''We are peaceful in the middle of an issue that has divided our country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Smith, along with Sanford's mayor, Jeff Triplett, and other community leaders, is seeking to repair longstanding wounds laid bare by Mr. Martin's shooting -- namely the distrust that many black residents harbor toward the city's police. ''People are saying, 'I guess you want to go back to normal living.' No we don't,'' said another pastor, John Murphy. ''We want to go forward. We have to repent for all the things that stood in the way before of unity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone appreciated the stillness. A day after the verdict, Isaac Jones, 56, spent part of his morning on a bench near a memorial for Mr. Martin in Goldsboro, and sadly took in the neighborhood's quiet. ''Everybody's taking this way too calm,'' he said. ''Something has to be done. It's going to happen again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other residents said that though Mr. Zimmerman was acquitted, his life would forever be haunted. ''He is going to be on the run for the rest of his life,'' said Mack Cotton, 51. ''And he's going to see that kid for the rest of his life. He ain't going to be able to run from it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If some people in Sanford wanted to move onward, others on Monday said parts of the city were caught too tightly in more intractable grips -- poverty, and what many here see as unfair administration of the law. ''There is no normal. Every day is a struggle,'' said Mr. Williams, who lives on disability checks. ''There are so many laws down here that were not built for us in the black community.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a few doors down, at the Goldsboro Westside Community Museum, home to photos of civil rights leaders and relics from the town's segregationist past, the curator, Francis Oliver, said the verdict had brought some peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We wanted George Zimmerman arrested; we got it. We wanted him to have his day in court; we got it. We wanted a new police chief; we got it,'' she said. ''We have said before what we wanted out of the whole thing.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Zimmerman Is Acquitted in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Killing'' (front page, July 14):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I learned of the not guilty verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman, my first reaction was one of sympathy for the family members of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. They were dealt a life sentence of pain, never knowing precisely what happened on that fateful night because the only person alive to tell the story is the one who shot their son to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury, which sifted through a mountain of testimony and evidence, obviously concluded that Mr. Zimmerman acted in self-defense, that it was his voice heard on tape crying for help. Its verdict must be accepted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcome in the case creates no winners. The Martin family has lost a son under the worst circumstances, and Mr. Zimmerman, who will always be believed guilty of murder by many, can go nowhere within this country without being recognized and disparaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our nation, which has followed the case with intense interest, is left to wonder what would have happened had Mr. Zimmerman left police work to the police, as a dispatcher had asked him to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OREN M. SPIEGLER Upper St. Clair, Pa., July 14, 2013</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the rhetoric on both sides, the criminal justice system sometimes works as it is supposed to. George Zimmerman should have been charged. He ignored a direct police order not to follow Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, he initiated the encounter, and he intentionally shot and killed an unarmed teenager. His statements about the events were inconsistent, and there was evidence he was the aggressor. In legal terms, there was definitely ''probable cause'' to charge Mr. Zimmerman with second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution presented its case, warts and all (with a few self-inflicted wounds no doubt), and the jury unanimously decided that there was not proof beyond a reasonable doubt of Mr. Zimmerman's guilt. Whether one likes the results or not, based on an objective assessment of the evidence, the jurors made the right decision. In short, the case played out as it should have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now let's hope the civil justice system works just as well, and Mr. Zimmerman is sued, found liable and forced to pay damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHN BLUME Ithaca, N.Y., July 14, 2013</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer is a professor at Cornell Law School and teaches criminal procedure and evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous studies show that the presence of even one minority juror changes for the better how the jury as a whole deliberates. Representative juries consider more evidence from more points of view with more collective recall of the facts. This makes it imperative to consider why jury selection in the George Zimmerman trial, like jury selection in so many counties in the United States, continues to underrepresent African-Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African-Americans make up about 11.8 percent of the population of Seminole County, from which the Zimmerman jury was drawn, but not a single African-American made it onto the actual jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have no objective measure of what counts as a ''right'' verdict in the Zimmerman case. All we have are reasons to believe that the jury works well when it has the democratic credentials to speak for the whole community. No matter how well intentioned the Zimmerman jurors were as individuals, they did not form a democratic whole.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, is author of ''We, the Jury: The Jury System and the Ideal of Democracy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An important lesson in the George Zimmerman case is largely ignored. It doesn't matter if you are a private citizen, a neighborhood watch captain or a community watch coordinator. If you see something suspicious, don't intervene; call 911. Let the professionals deal with the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most likely outcome is, if indeed the suspicious person has larceny on his mind, he will leave when the police come by. A crime prevented is better than a crime being prosecuted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer is a community watch coordinator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial of George Zimmerman focused largely on who was the aggressor in the physical fight they had. But some people did not even entertain the possibility that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin may have been acting in self-defense -- that's where racism comes in. He was the one being followed by an armed man for no apparent reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I realize that Mr. Zimmerman may have erroneously thought that Mr. Martin was a threat, this incident illustrates why if one is not under immediate threat, it is best to leave these matters to the police. The last thing we need is rampant untrained citizen vigilantism, or we are bound to have more Trayvon&nbsp;Martins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEBORAH MORAN Houston, July 14, 2013</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racial dimensions of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case have been explored at length. What is rarely mentioned is what is most obvious about this tragic incident: George Zimmerman was walking around a common area (not his own personal property) with a loaded handgun when he confronted Mr. Martin. This is legal in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A citizen ''on patrol'' should be armed with a cellphone and nothing more. Had this been the case, Mr. Martin would be alive. End of story.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Victor Cruz emerged contrite and reflective yesterday after the Giants' Pro Bowl wideout was part of a dustup on Twitter over the weekend in the aftermath of the George Zimmerman trial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz repeatedly apologized after tweeting Saturday what some took to be a call to violence against Zimmerman after the neighborhood watchman was acquitted in the Florida shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Thoroughly confused. Zimmerman doesn't last a year before the hood catches up to him,&quot; Cruz wrote on Twitter late Saturday night before deleting the tweet soon afterward. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz said yesterday he regretted the tweet almost immediately. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Once I put it out [there], I read it, and I was like, 'You know, it was the wrong thing to do,' &quot; Cruz told WFAN's Boomer Esiason and Craig Carton. &quot;I see kids that follow me. I'm a role model to a lot of these kids, and they follow me and look up to me, and I felt like it wasn't the right thing to post.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz said the negative reaction was immediate and fierce, and included some Twitter users calling him the n-word, a response he called &quot;pretty shocking.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fresh off a five-year, $43 million extension from the Giants he signed last week, Cruz said he now realizes he is expected to behave to a higher standard now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;When you're in the position like I am and have some success and you become a public figure, not just in New York City but across the world, you have an entitlement to promote positivity [because] there's going to be a lot of eyes that look up to you,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm the last guy that wants to promote violence on anyone in any way, shape or form.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz said he didn't receive any blowback from the Giants over the incident. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;They were pleased with the way we handled it,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A juror in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin murder case said last night she thought that George Zimmerman's &quot;heart was in the right place&quot; on the night he fatally shot the unarmed teenager in Sanford, Fla.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The woman, known only as Juror B37, spoke publicly for the first time during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think George Zimmerman's heart was in the right place,&quot; said the woman, appearing in silhouette. &quot;But he went above and beyond what he should've done . . . It just went terribly wrong.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She also said she believed Martin &quot;threw the first punch&quot; in the encounter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think Trayvon got mad and attacked him,&quot; she said. &quot;I had no doubt that George feared for his life.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Late Saturday night, the six-woman jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder. Three panelists originally wanted to convict but changed their minds, the juror said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   She did not believe race was an aspect of the case, and emphasized Zimmerman had a right to defend himself and should be allowed to carry a gun again.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He's learned his lesson,&quot; she said. &quot;I think he would be more responsible [with a gun] than anyone else on the planet right now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The juror initially planned to write a book but nixed the plan early this morning. &quot;I have realized the best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book,&quot; she said in a statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The woman criticized a key witness for the prosecution, Rachel Jeantel, 19, who was asked at the trial to read a letter she supposedly wrote about the slaying, only to admit she couldn't read cursive.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think she felt inadequate because of her education and communication skills,&quot; the juror said. &quot;I didn't think [the testimony] was very credible.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later on CNN, Jeantel responded that she was &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;upset&quot; by the juror's characterization.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jeantel also disagreed with the juror about the racial component of the incident, saying &quot;Let's be honest&quot; - it was &quot;racial.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She told Piers Morgan that Martin did not have guns but smoked weed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Trayvon was not a thug,&quot; Jeantel said. &quot;Weed didn't make him go crazy. It just made him go hungry.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the meantime, Zimmerman's parents said last night they have received &quot;an enormous amount of death threats,&quot; and have remained in hiding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Speaking with ABC's Barbara Walters, Robert and Gladys Zimmerman said they are afraid even to reach out to their son. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Under the circumstances, we have not been able to talk to him,&quot; Gladys Zimmerman said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;To tell you the truth, we don't trust anything, not even the phones.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reacting to the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict, President Obama was kind of classy - but the New York City mayoral munchkins, not so much. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We are a nation of laws,&quot; said the president over the weekend, &quot;and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wise words. Sound counsel.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sure, Obama gave the racial resentment pot a mighty stir shortly after the fight that left Martin - who was black - dead and George Zimmerman - a Hispanic deemed &quot;white&quot; in the media narrative - charged with murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; said our president, unhelpfully. But he had re-election to win, and an electorate to energize - and a politician's gotta do what a politician's gotta do. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The same instinct clearly was at work in New York Saturday night: When the Florida jury deemed Zimmerman not guilty of the crimes charged, a wash of corrosive rhetoric poured from the city's mayoral aspirants.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To wit: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was killed because he was black. There was no justice done today in Florida,&quot; said William Thompson, who is himself African-American - and who also knows better, as we shall see. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l City Council Speaker Christine Quinn (D-Manhattan) termed the verdict &quot;a shocking insult&quot; - adding, nonsensically, &quot;We must also put an end to a culture that presumes any young man of color . . . is looking to commit a crime simply because he was walking down the street.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l And Anthony Weiner broadcast a decidedly contradictory message, finding the verdict &quot;deeply unsatisfying,&quot; but noting &quot;trial by jury is our only choice in a democracy.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was more, but it amounted to nothing - except for Republican John Catsimatidis' absolutely spot-on observation: &nbsp;&quot;When you have safe streets, tragedies like this don't happen.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Without fully rehashing the Martin-Zimmerman case, it should be noted that the Sanford, Fla., police department isn't very efficient; burglaries there were both rampant and largely a black enterprise; a neighborhood watch was formed - and presently the fatal encounter occurred. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Zimmerman, the jury found, was acting within the law right up to the conclusion of the fight; Martin, essentially, was the victim of cruel circumstance - and of Florida burglars unnamed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet to extend Catsimatidis' thought, when you have safe streets people accept them as a fact of life - and there's scant appreciation of the need to keep them safe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In New York City, that debate revolves around the NYPD's use of so-called &quot;stop-and-frisk&quot; - essentially an aggressive police presence in high-crime neighborhoods.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's been an astonishingly successful approach: Cops look for violent criminals where violent crime occurs, one result being that New York is the safest big city in America.&nbsp;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it's also controversial: A lot of people resent what they term the stigmatizing attention it brings to certain precincts - and so it has become a major pander point in the mayoral campaign.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Interestingly, Thompson seems to get it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I'm the one who has to worry about my son being stopped and frisked,&quot; he said earlier this year. &quot;But I'm worried also about my son being shot by someone who's a member of a gang in the street.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And worried he should be. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some 97 percent of the city's shooters last year were black or Hispanic, according to the NYPD - as were fully 96 percent of its shooting victims. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such numbers - indeed, street-crime stats right across the board - speak loudly to social dislocations that run deep in the city. The same pathologies - not to put too fine a point on it - threaten not only public safety, but also the stability of the city's public schools, among other things.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the fact that none of this is even a small part of the 2013 mayoral discussion is profoundly disturbing. Alas, it's much easier to sacrifice yet another generation to false pride and cheap electoral opportunism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Certainly, the candidates had an opportunity Saturday night. They all spoke nonsense, save for John Catsimatidis - who has no chance of becoming mayor. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An FBI report on the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin killing could drown out the growing chorus calling for a civil-rights prosecution of acquitted shooter George Zimmerman, legal experts said yesterday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the report, FBI agents quoted the lead investigator describing the neighborhood-watch volunteer as &quot;overzealous and as having a 'little hero complex,' but not as a racist.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The April 2012 report says Sanford, Fla., Detective Chris Serino found &quot;Zimmerman's actions were not based on Martin's skin color&quot; but &quot;on his attire, the total circumstances of the encounter and the previous burglary suspects in the community.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Prominent Manhattan lawyer Gerald Shargel said the report &quot;clearly weighs in Zimmerman's favor&quot; and is &quot;going to carry a lot of weight in a charging decision.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;They need proof beyond a reasonable doubt that this was racially motivated,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Top civil-rights lawyer Ron Kuby said: &quot;Even if the FBI's assessment of George Zimmerman was that he was a flaming racist, I don't think there would be a federal prosecution.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The [Justice] Department knows they're unlikely to prevail, and federal prosecutors don't like to lose,&quot; Kuby said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Attorney General Eric Holder yesterday said he was &quot;mindful of the pain felt by our nation surrounding the tragic, unnecessary shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he was noncommittal regarding the federal probe of the slaying, telling the national convention of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority in DC that the Justice Department would follow &quot;the facts and the law.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Outside the Manhattan federal courthouse, local members of Congress called for civil-rights charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin did not have a gun. He did not have a knife . . . All Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had was a pack of Skittles,&quot; said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-Brooklyn). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-Queens) said: &quot;We know the jury has made a decision, but we do not have to agree with that decision, and we will not.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, one of the trial's six jurors has inked a deal to sell her story. &quot;Juror B37&quot; plans to write a book with her lawyer husband, said literary agent Sharlene Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also yesterday, the NYPD said 15 people were busted across upper Manhattan for blocking traffic during protests of the acquittal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Post reporter saw protesters hurling bottles at cops, but no injuries were reported.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests continued yesterday across the United States after George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer accused of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager, was cleared of all charges against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities had asked the residents of Sanford, Florida, where the killing and subsequent trial took place, to keep the peace after hearing the verdict on Sunday in a case that has gripped the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday the riots feared by the police failed to materialise, but peaceful protests had been reported as far afield as Washington, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta and San Francisco. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York, hundreds of protesters marched into Times Square, zigzagging through the streets to avoid police lines. Marchers thronged the busy intersection, chanting &quot;Justice for! Trayvon&nbsp;Martin!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In San Francisco and Los Angeles - where an earlier protest was dispersed with beanbag rounds - police closed streets as protesters marched to condemn Zimmerman&quot;s acquittal. In Los Angeles, around 200 demonstrators gathered for a vigil in one of the city&quot;s African-American neighbourhoods, Leimert Park. Police in Oakland, California, said a small crowd took to the streets, with some breaking windows, spraying anti-police graffiti and burning US and California state flags.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, about 200 protesters marched with signs that said &quot;racism is not dead&quot; and &quot;who&quot;s next?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, is now a free man, but the Justice Department said it is looking into Martin&quot;s death to determine whether federal prosecutors will file criminal civil rights charges against his killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With many critics angry over Zimmerman&quot;s acquittal, his freedom may be limited. He may also face civil lawsuits from Martin&quot;s family. &quot;He&quot;s going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,&quot; his brother, Robert Zimmerman told CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama called Martin&quot;s death a tragedy for America but asked that everyone respect calls for calm reflection. &quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department opened an investigation into Martin&quot;s death last year but stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department yesterday said the criminal section of its civil rights division, the FBI and the local US Attorney&quot;s office are continuing to evaluate the evidence. Experience has shown it&quot;s not easy getting convictions in such high-profile prosecutions. Alan Vinegrad, a former US Attorney, said federal prosecutors &quot;would have to show not only that the attack was unjustified, but that Mr Zimmerman attacked Mr Martin because of his race and because he was using a public facility, the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was race important?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman&quot;s opponents believe he followed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because he was a young black man wearing a hoodie. Zimmerman told police he had seen someone and told the dispatcher: &quot;F****** punks. These assholes, they always get away.&quot; He was ruled to have shot Trayvon in self-defence. Cuts and bruises on Zimmerman&quot;s head showed the pair had fought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So is self-defence plausible?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a 911 call made by one of Zimmerman&quot;s neighbours as the pair were fighting, a voice pleads for help. The prosecution said this was Trayvon. The defence said it was Zimmerman. Neither side was able to prove who was speaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the witnesses?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&quot;s friend, Rachel Jeantel, on the phone with him not long before he died, said he kept complaining that a man was watching him. She heard Trayvon tell someone to &quot;get off&quot; before the line went dead. An expert defence witness claimed the angle of the shot that killed Martin proved he was on top of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of demonstrators from across the US - chanting, praying and fighting tears - protested a jury&quot;s decision to clear neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager, and organisers say they will try to maintain the momentum with vigils next weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rallies on Sunday (local time) were largely peaceful as demonstrators voiced their support for 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot;s family and decried the verdict. Police in Los Angeles said they arrested six people, mostly for failure to disperse, after about 80 protesters gathered in Hollywood on Sunset Boulevard and an unlawful assembly was declared. New York police said at least a dozen people were arrested on disorderly conduct charges during a rally in Times Square. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates want federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman, who was acquitted in Martin&quot;s 2012 shooting death. The Rev. Al Sharpton said that his organisation will hold vigils and rallies in 100 cities in front of federal buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department has said it&quot;s considering whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman has been acquitted in the state case. The department opened an investigation into Martin&quot;s death last year but stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday&quot;s demonstrations, held in cities from Florida to Wisconsin, attracted anywhere from a few dozen people to a more than a thousand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a march and rally in downtown Chicago attended by about 200 people, 73-year-old Maya Miller said the case reminded her of the 1955 slaying of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old from Chicago who was murdered by a group of white men while visiting Mississippi. Till&quot;s killing galvanised the civil rights movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fifty-eight years and nothing&quot;s changed,&quot; Miller said, pausing to join a chant for &quot;Justice for Trayvon, not one more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York City, more than 1,000 people marched into Times Square on Sunday night, zigzagging through Manhattan&quot;s streets to avoid police lines. Sign-carrying marchers thronged the busy intersection, chanting &quot;Justice for! Trayvon&nbsp;Martin!&quot; as they made their way from downtown Union Square, blocking traffic for more than an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In San Francisco and in Los Angeles, where police dispersed an earlier protest with beanbag rounds, police closed streets Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama, Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson have urged calm. In Oakland, California, during protests that began late Saturday night, some angry demonstrators broke windows, burned US flags, vandalised a police squad car and spray-painted anti-police graffiti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti urged protesters to &quot;practice peace&quot; after rock- and bottle-throwing. Later, more than 100 officers in riot gear converged and ordered people to disperse. A handful of people were given citations, mostly for blocking a street or jaywalking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rand Powdrill, 41, of San Leandro, California, said he marched in San Francisco with about 400 others to &quot;protest the execution of an innocent black teenager&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If our voices can&quot;t be heard, then this is just going to keep going on,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, at Manhattan&quot;s Middle Collegiate Church, many congregants wore hooded sweatshirts similar to the one Martin was wearing the night he was shot. Hoodie-clad Jessica Nacinovich said she could only feel disappointment and sadness over the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I&quot;m sure jurors did what they felt was right in accordance with the law but maybe the law is wrong, maybe society is wrong; there&quot;s a lot that needs fixing,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a service in Sanford, Fla., where Zimmerman was tried, teens wearing shirts with Martin&quot;s picture wiped away tears during a church sermon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters also gathered in Atlanta, Miami, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Washington, DC, along with a host of other cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Miami, more than 200 people gathered. &quot;You can&quot;t justify murder,&quot; read one poster. Another read &quot;Don&quot;t worry about more riots. Worry about more Zimmermans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol Reitner, 76, of Miami, said she heard about the vigil through an announcement at her church Sunday morning. &quot;I was really devastated. It&quot;s really hard to believe that someone can take the life of someone else and walk out of court free,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Philadelphia, about 700 protesters marched through downtown to the Liberty Bell, alternating between chanting Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot;s name and &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope this will begin a movement to end discrimination against young black men,&quot; said Johnathan Cooper, one of the protest&quot;s organisers. &quot;And also to empower black people and get them involved in the system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Atlanta, about 75 protesters chanted and carried signs near Centennial Olympic Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I came out today because a great deal of injustice has been done and I&quot;m very disappointed at our justice system,&quot; said Tabatha Holley, 19, of Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I&quot;m just disappointed in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON (AP) When President Barack Obama first addressed the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last year, he did so passionately, declaring that if he had a son, he would look like the slain 17-year-old. His powerful and personal commentary marked a rare public reflection on race from the nation&quot;s first black president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, with the neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot Martin acquitted and the burden of filing any future charges squarely on his own administration, Obama is seeking to inject calm into a case that has inflamed passions, including his own. In a brief statement, the president called Martin&quot;s killing a &quot;tragedy&quot; but implored the public to respect a Florida jury&quot;s decision to clear George Zimmerman, the man charged in the death of the unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,&quot; Obama said Sunday. &quot;But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president&quot;s restrained response underscores the complicated calculus for the White House as it grapples with the fallout from the racially charged case. Obama faces inevitable questions about the verdict, given his previous statements on the matter and his own race. But as the head of a government considering levying federal charges against Zimmerman, he must also avoid the appearance of influencing an ongoing Justice Department investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is a lawyer and I think his legal sense is that he should do nothing that would interrupt or disrupt any future matters involving George Zimmerman,&quot; said Charles Ogletree, a law professor at Harvard University and longtime friend of the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the nation&quot;s first black president, Obama is frequently pressed about questions of race, though he often refrains from weighing in. And on the occasions where he did, he&quot;s had uneven results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama&quot;s speech on race as a presidential candidate in 2008 was widely praised as an honest and politically risky handling of the tricky topic. But his 2009 comments about the arrest of a black Harvard professor in his own home turned into a political firestorm and the president was forced to retract his statement that police had &quot;acted stupidly&quot; in detaining Henry Gates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the furor over the president&quot;s criticism of Gates&quot; arrest centered on the fact that his comments targeted law enforcement. Perhaps learning a lesson from that experience, the president and his advisers have purposefully avoided weighing in on the handling of the Zimmerman case by police, the courts and his own Justice Department, which is reviewing the prospect of filing criminal civil rights charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He will not comment on a Department of Justice investigation or on a decision that the Department of Justice will make on how to proceed, if to proceed,&quot; White House spokesman Jay Carney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Obama&quot;s comments both in the weeks after Martin&quot;s death and following the verdict have been more personal, focusing in part on his response as a father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon,&quot; Obama said when he first addressed the case in March 2012. &quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite White House efforts to carefully avoid weighing in on legal aspects of the case, Republicans have criticized the president for commenting at all, saying his words helped a local legal matter morph into a national spectacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama politicized this at the beginning of it, I believe, unfortunately, by injecting himself into it,&quot; said Karl Rove, former political adviser to President George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Republican Rep. Steve King said the president turned a law-and-order matter &quot;into a political issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rove and King both spoke Sunday on Fox News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was acquitted Saturday in the February shooting death of Martin, who was unarmed when he was killed. Martin&quot;s parents and civil rights leaders said Zimmerman racially profiled the teenager when he followed him through a gated community in Sanford, Florida, and shot him, but Zimmerman said he was physically assaulted by Martin and shot the teenager in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department can still launch criminal civil rights charges against Zimmerman. Attorney General Eric Holder is reviewing evidence to determine whether to proceed on such charges after stepping aside to allow the state prosecution to run its course. However, legal experts say there are major hurdles to federal prosecution, including the burden of proving that Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch leader, was motivated by racial animosity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder, the nation&quot;s first black attorney general, said Monday that Martin&quot;s killing was a &quot;tragic, unnecessary shooting.&quot; The Justice Department, he said, will follow &quot;the facts and the law&quot; as it reviews evidence to see whether federal criminal charges are warranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and other civil rights organizations dismayed by the Florida jury&quot;s verdict are calling on the Justice Department to open a case against Zimmerman. As of Monday evening, more than 17,000 people had signed a White House petition supporting Department of Justice charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior White House officials have discussed the case with NAACP leaders in recent days, the organization said. But the White House insisted Monday that the president would not personally be involved in the decision to levy charges nor would he weigh in personally on whether he supported that step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cases are brought on the merits,&quot; Carney said. &quot;The president expects, as in every case, that the process will be handled in the way it should be, at the Department of Justice, and certainly not here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI (AP) Three jurors in George Zimmerman&quot;s second-degree murder trial initially favored convicting him of that offense or manslaughter, but the six-woman jury ultimately voted to acquit him in the killing of an unarmed black teenager after more closely examining the law, a juror in the case said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch volunteer, was charged with second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last year, but the jury also was allowed to consider manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman, known as Juror B37, told CNN&quot;s Anderson Cooper that when the jury began deliberations Friday, they took an initial vote. Three jurors including B37 were in favor of acquittal, two supported manslaughter and one backed second-degree murder. She said the jury started going through all the evidence, listening to tapes multiple times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That&quot;s why it took us so long,&quot; said B37, who said she planned to write a book about the trial but later had a change of heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they started looking at the law, the person who initially wanted second-degree murder changed her vote to manslaughter, the juror said. Then they asked for clarification from the judge and went over it again and again. B37 said some jurors wanted to find Zimmerman guilty of something, but there was just no place to go based on the law,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B37 said jurors cried when they gave their final vote to the bailiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want people to know that we put everything into everything to get this verdict,&quot; said the juror, whose face was blacked out during the televised interview but who appeared to become choked up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interview came two days after the jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Martin in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, where the teenager was visiting family. Martin was black, and Zimmerman, whose mother is Peruvian, identifies himself as Hispanic. While prosecutors accused Zimmerman of profiling Martin, Zimmerman maintained he acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anger over Zimmerman&quot;s acquittal continued Monday, with civil rights leaders saying mostly peaceful protests will continue with vigils and rallies in 100 cities Saturday in front of federal buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Los Angeles, several hundred mostly peaceful protesters gathered Monday night at Leimert Park southwest of downtown, many of them chanting, praying and singing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a smaller group of about 100 people splintered off and began blocking traffic on nearby Crenshaw Boulevard, some of them jumping on cars and breaking windows. Several protesters ran into a Wal-Mart store, where they knocked down displays before store security chased them out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said it is looking into Martin&quot;s death to determine whether federal prosecutors will file criminal civil rights charges against Zimmerman, who is now a free man. His lawyer has told ABC News that Zimmerman will get his gun back and intends to arm himself again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday called the killing of Martin a &quot;tragic, unnecessary shooting,&quot; and said the Justice Department will follow &quot;the facts and the law&quot; as it reviews evidence to see whether federal criminal charges are warranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key to filing civil rights charges against Zimmerman lies in whether evidence exists that he was motivated by racial animosity to kill Martin. Zimmerman&quot;s parents, Gladys and Robert Zimmerman Sr., told ABC News that their son isn&quot;t racist and that they don&quot;t know if their son will ever be able to return to a normal life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesman Jay Carney on Monday said Obama would not involve himself in decisions by the Justice Department on whether to pursue civil rights charges against Zimmerman because it would inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department opened an investigation into Martin&quot;s death last year but stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The February 2012 shooting drew national attention when Zimmerman wasn&quot;t arrested for weeks, and the case has continued to raise questions over race and self-defense gun laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors were told that Zimmerman was allowed to use deadly force when he shot the teen not only if he actually faced death or bodily harm, but also if he merely thought he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37, the only juror to speak publicly about the case so far, said Monday that the actions of Zimmerman and Martin both led to the teenager&quot;s fatal shooting, but that Zimmerman didn&quot;t actually break the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zimmerman made some poor decisions leading up to the shooting, including leaving his car when police told him not to, Martin wasn&quot;t innocent either, the juror said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into,&quot; said the juror. &quot;I think they both could have walked away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror said she didn&quot;t think Martin&quot;s race was the reason that Zimmerman followed him on a dark, rainy night. She said she also believed Martin threw the first punch and that Zimmerman, whom she referred to as &quot;George,&quot; had a right to defend himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have no doubt George feared for his life in the situation he was in at the time,&quot; the juror said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror was not impressed by the testimony of Rachel Jeantel, who was talking with Martin by cellphone moments before he was fatally shot by Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn&quot;t think it was very credible, but I felt very sorry for her,&quot; the juror said. &quot;She didn&quot;t want to be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37 told CNN that it was a difficult process in reaching a verdict. She said the jury instructions from the judge weren&quot;t immediately clear and the evidence was in no order whatsoever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thought about it for hours and cried over it afterwards,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&quot;t think any of us could ever do anything like that ever again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Literary Management announced Monday that it was representing B37 and her husband, who is an attorney. The names of the jurors have not been released, but during jury selection it was disclosed that B37 works in an unspecified management position and has two adult children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But agency head Sharlene Martin released a statement late Monday saying she was no longer representing the juror and that the juror had dropped the book idea. It included a statement that she said was crafted in conjunction with the agency in which the juror explained that being sequestered had kept her shielded &quot;from the depth of pain that exists among the general public over every aspect of the case.&quot; The juror said that the book was meant to show that our justice system &quot;can get so complicated that it creates a conflict with our &quot;spirit&quot; of justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Associated Press was unable to reach the juror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate interview, Jeantel was asked by CNN&quot;s Piers Morgan whether she thought race was a factor in Zimmerman&quot;s decision to follow Martin prior to their fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was racial,&quot; she said. &quot;Let&quot;s be honest. Racial. If he were white, if Trayvon was white and he had a hoodie on, what would happen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morgan played back a recording of the juror&quot;s comments to CNN about Jeantel&quot;s education level and speech, and the witness said it made her sad and angry. Jeantel, who is black, said she also had a feeling that the jury would return a not-guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With many critics angry over Zimmerman&quot;s acquittal, his freedom may be limited. He may also face a civil lawsuit from Martin&quot;s family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He&quot;s going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,&quot; his brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr. told CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the racially charged nature of the case, race was barely mentioned at the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors portrayed Zimmerman as a vigilante who had grown frustrated by break-ins in his neighborhood committed primarily by young black men. Defense attorneys said Martin knocked Zimmerman down and was slamming the older man&quot;s head against the sidewalk when Zimmerman fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court did not release the racial and ethnic makeup of the six-person jury, but the panel appeared to reporters to be made up of five white women and a sixth who may be Hispanic.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 16--NEW HAVEN -- Sensing his parishioners would want to talk about Saturday's &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict in the George Zimmerman case, the Rev. Frederick Streets encouraged them Sunday morning to stand up and share during a service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure a lot of people didn't sleep last night,&quot; Streets said. &quot;There is still this perception of black men as threats. It is important to us to pause for a few moments and take an opportunity to share.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several parishioners at the Dixwell Avenue Congregational United Church of Christ, where the congregation is predominantly African American, did take that opportunity, taking the microphone to speak their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury in Florida on Saturday cleared Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, of all charges in the fatal shooting of teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, claimed he acted in self-defense. Prosecutors portrayed Zimmerman as a vigilante who assumed Martin, who was young and black, was up to something, and confronted him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's Stand Your Ground law allows for the use of deadly force if someone believes they are in danger of death or great bodily harm. It allows an individual to stand his or her ground, with no duty to retreat from a confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parishioner Jan Simmons said, &quot;Although the verdict is not unexpected, it still deeply saddens me -- justice is not something we experience as a people. There are policies that keep us oppressed, and the struggle continues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Police Chief Thaddeus Reddish called what took place in Florida &quot;a disgrace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every police officer is taught not to use deadly force unless it is absolutely necessary,&quot; Reddish said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Toni Harp, D-New Haven, a candidate for Mayor in New Haven, called gun violence &quot;a disease that has affected this entire country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can use the political system for change,&quot; Harp said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Audrey Tyson said she is &quot;devastated,&quot; and wants to know why this happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe in God, but can't understand why this continues to happen to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Toni Walker, D-New Haven, said people should talk about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This young man's life can't just be lost -- write to newspapers, to Congress, mobilize,&quot; she said. &quot;He wore a hoodie and went to a store, and he was targeted and profiled by this vigilante. Vigilantism has to stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let Florida know we are all watching -- it has to be all of us, not just one voice or two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parishioner Rodrick Muhammad said the black community needs to come together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know Trayvon is up in heaven, proud we didn't riot,&quot; he said. &quot;Pray harder, study the word of God harder. Let's rise up and become a family again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several parishioners shared stories of being racially profiled themselves, such as being pulled over -- and urged each other to speak up when it happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Streets told parishioners that he is sure there are many white people who are upset with the verdict also.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't feel you can't do anything -- move to change the Stand Your Ground law,&quot; Streets said. &quot;We have to pray and do the right thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. James Newman, who is president of the Greater New Haven Clergy Association and pastor of the New Freedom Missionary Baptist Church in New Haven, said many pastors may have had their sermons planned already, but in light of the verdict, he changed his to address the case Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did a sermon on justice and judgment and how people who do unjust things can always find a way out of feeling guilty,&quot; Newman said. &quot;They can always say that what they did was ok. God is the only judge and he wants us to do what is right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone I've talked to feels this was unjust,&quot; Newman said. &quot;Blacks still feel victimized by racism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newman noted there was a prison sentence in the case of an African American Florida woman who fired a warning shot in a domestic incident, without hitting anyone. He noted that Michael Vick also served time for his conviction in a dog-fighting case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yet someone who kills a black kid gets no time,&quot; Newman said. &quot;Police told (Zimmerman) not to follow that kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman had called police to report a suspicious person, and was told that officers were on their way and he shouldn't follow the individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel very strongly this was unfair,&quot; Newman said. &quot;It is a sad day. Everyone who wears a hoodie on their head isn't a criminal. There is so much stereotyping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to a service at the Dixwell Avenue Congregational United Church of Christ as a Mass.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My heart and prayers go out to the Martin family -- what a tragedy. I do not agree with the jury's decision to acquit George Zimmerman. He should have to pay; he took a life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also do not agree with the protests from the black community. When O.J. Simpson was acquitted of murder, black people were jubilant despite the fact that two families had lost children. The Los Angeles riots after the Rodney King incident, where a white truck driver was beaten senseless, were hardly noticed by the black community. I thought racism was on the decline. White people prove it's not by remaining silent when racism surfaces, and black people prove it's not by rioting and beating innocent white people. I had hoped this would change. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resist all forms of bigotry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am deeply offended by the cries of Jesse Jackson and the NAACP for civil action against George Zimmerman because a basic right of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin (i.e. life) has been denied. Where were these people when the basic rights of the two human beings O.J. Simpson was accused of killing were denied? If the outrage over Martin is due to perceptions of injustice, why now and not then?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passions rise on both sides of the argument when the subject touches even lightly on race. As is unfortunately necessary when discussing this subject, in particular when the argument does not follow &quot;politically correct&quot; opinion, the speaker (or writer, in this case) must defend himself against suspicions of bigotry. In that regard, I offer the following: My father was a strong supporter of civil rights, even in the 1940s when it more reflected conscience than conformity to a trendy movement. I was thus immersed in the concept of civil rights from birth, at times too willing to forgive errant behavior once I learned of the perpetrator's dark skin. My final maturity came after the O.J. Simpson trial. There the verdict more reflected resentment of police errors (and bigotry) than revulsion at the brutal slaughter of two human beings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our fear of attaching nasty brands to ourselves makes us ineffective in tackling the problem. Racism of any kind is wrong. When someone makes a decision, good or bad, based on the color of one's skin rather than the content of one's character, they are racist. This applies to all races, including those suffering more than their share of injustice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was taught to hate racism, but that to me meant hating it wherever I found it, and regardless of the race, religion, color or sexual preference of the person practicing it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blame the prosecutors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those calling for the heads of the jury in the Zimmerman/Martin trial should put the blame where it belongs -- on the backs of the bad performance by the state of Florida. The prosecution put on the worst trial possible, leaving the jury with mounds of conflicting and inconsequential information. National Public Radio interviewed a University of Florida law professor who gave the prosecution very low grades in performance, and concluded the state became the defense and the defense became the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race relations in this country need dialogue, but using the jury as a hatchet is not the way to obtain this objective. Dialogue and mutual understanding are the only way we will come together as a united nation, and church and civic leaders should be working toward this goal; not uttering self-serving and inflammatory statements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deaths go unnoticed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the U.S. Department of Justice may pursue George Zimmerman for a hate crime. If that doesn't work, they can always try to take it to the International Criminal Court in The Hague and have him prosecuted for crimes against humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, 18 black male 17-year-olds have been shot and killed in Chicago since February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jury acted properly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only person in this whole mess who seems to be right from the very beginning is the former Sanford police chief. Still, they fired him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the trial is finally over I feel huge comfort knowing the women of the jury stayed strong and were able to wade through the piles of, uh, mud, the prosecution slung about all over the place. These women listened, understood and followed the letter of the law. They held evidence high, and applied the law without stirring in measures of &quot;what ifs&quot; and over-the top suggestions. No easy job. There are not enough words available to praise them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman made the mistake of using poor judgment by leaving his vehicle. That error cost him dearly. Yes, he's alive to tell about it. But does he have or will he ever have a life? Probably not for a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the uproar continues. Hundreds display despicable behavior because they feel justice was not served. In my heart I believe they don't give a damn about justice. They don't bother to camouflage their need for revenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, we all feel sadness for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and his family. It's a shame. Truly a shame. But it's over and done with. If society's relationships are to be improved then educate, educate, educate. Nothing will ever get better unless people learn. Those spouting off, like the Rev. Al Sharpton, only fuel a vicious fire. That rampage of dimly disguised hate only makes matters worse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD: US President Barack Obama has appealed to Americans for restraint amid anger from civil rights activists and public protests against the acquittal of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury of six women -- reportedly five white and one Hispanic --on the weekend found neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, after a long and racially charged trial that transfixed much of the US for weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second-degree murder, having pursued Trayvon, 17, through a gated community in the town of Sanford, eventually shooting him during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial aroused strong passions and divided those who believed that Mr Zimmerman -- whose father is white and mother is Peruvian -- had racially profiled Trayvon, and those who believed he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spontaneous protests broke out in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta overnight, following the verdict, though they were mostly peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, a large demonstration in New York attracted several thousand people, with placards that read: ``Jail racist killers, not black youth'' and ``We are all Trayvon. The whole damn system is guilty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the marchers in lower Manhattan wore a T-shirt proclaiming: ``I'm black. Please don't shoot?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr Obama, the first black US president, urged people to accept the trial verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,'' Mr Obama said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in Oakland, California, protesters had smashed windows and spray-painted cars after the verdict was announced live</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama had spoken sombrely on Trayvon before, noting that if he had a son he would ``look like Trayvon''.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman unrest continues. Police in Oakland and Los Angeles had to breakup demonstrations involving those who disagreed with the not-guilty verdict Saturday in the George Zimmerman trial in Florida. Demonstrators knocked over displays in a Walmart in L.A. before guards ran them off. Meanwhile, a white man jogging on U.S. 51 near the northwest Mississippi town of Senatobia claims he was beaten up by several black males, one of who said, &quot;This is for Trayvon [Martin].&quot; The jogger was later found by a sheriff's deputy.</SPAN></P>

The Cuban-born outfielder hit 32 homers for the night; he'll be the first Derby winner to not qualify for the Midsummer Classic the following night. Speaking of which, the All-Star Game gets under way at New York's Citi Field tonight at 7, broadcast on Fox 6... Football: Pinson Valley standout Earnest Robinson will not be headed to Auburn after all, at least not for two more years. The wide receiver failed to improve his grades enough in summer school and instead is enrolling at East Mississippi Community College in Scooba, about halfway between Meridian and Columbus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: As Americans mourn the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, one thing is clear: race and politics trumped gun control in the trial of George Zimmerman, William Marsden writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moment neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old white Latino, shot black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin dead in February 2012 as he walked innocently to his father's home in Sanford, Fla., race and politics took centre stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing reverberated throughout the nation's black communities, whose members know only too well the harsh reality of racial profiling and that the justice system is rife with racial bias, as many studies have shown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these two ingredients were mixed into the judicial process, two other elements in the case retreated into the shadows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those ingredients, however, would prove pivotal: gun control and Florida's socalled &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, plus its related statutes on self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essentially, Zimmerman was able to shoot Martin because Florida law - and the law in most states - permits him to carry a concealed weapon and gave him the right to use that weapon to defend himself against grave bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem, however, is people can get it wrong. They can misinterpret the danger. Luckily for these shooters, the law also protects against that eventuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chaos of such defensive-force situations means that people commonly make mistakes,&quot; Paul Robinson, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal. &quot;The law does not require that a person get it exactly right. It may be enough that the person honestly believed his force was necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman said he followed Martin because he thought he was a robber. When an angry Martin turned on him and began beating him up, Zimmerman shot him in self-defence. That's his story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police declared the shooting was indeed self-defence, civil rights activists organized mass protests. The dark hoodie Martin wore that fateful night became a civil rights emblem. Federal and state politicians met with prosecutors and urged Zimmerman's arrest and prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing was hashed out in America's newsrooms. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and MSNBC host, travelled to Florida where he led protest marches. CNN and MSNBC claimed the tape of a 911 call made by Zimmerman &quot;clearly&quot; recorded him calling Martin a &quot;coon.&quot; NBC host Joe O'Donnell said the tape &quot;constitutes obvious evidence of hateful intent.&quot; CNN later retracted its statement, admitting that the tape did not contain any racial slur but rather the word &quot;cold.&quot; O'Donnell said nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.' U.S. President Barack ObamaEven U.S. President Barack Obama joined the fray. He announced to the nation, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Justice Department sent FBI investigators to gather evidence for possible prosecution of Zimmerman for federal civil rights violations. No case was filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was finally charged about two months after the shooting with second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial did not go well for the prosecution. A witness said he saw a person in dark clothing (Martin wore a dark hoodie) holding a man to the ground and beating him, which confirmed Zimmerman's story. A policeman testified that he believed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's account that he shot Trayvon in self-defence. Photos of Zimmerman taken immediately after the killing showed him with a broken nose and wounds on the back of his head where he claimed Trayvon had slammed his head against the concrete sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no evidence at trial that Zimmerman had voiced racial slurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a jury of six women - five white and one Hispanic - found him not guilty of either charge, protests swept across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerned about possible violence, akin to the riots that inflamed the streets of Los Angeles following the acquittal of the policemen who beat Rodney King in 1991, Obama issued a statement, saying: &quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP produced a petition with 450,000 names urging the justice department to reopen a civil rights investigation against Zimmerman, claiming he killed Trayvon because he was black. The justice department agreed to reopen the file.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Zimmerman has the right to get his gun back.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous fought back tears as he lamented George Zimmerman's not guilty verdict and said that the issues surrounding the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last year -- gun violence and racial profiling -- would be the next front on the battle over civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It took us 60 years to end the scourge of lynch mob violence, but we did,&quot; Jealous told reporters Monday at the NAACP's annual convention here. &quot;If it takes us 60 years to end this bloodletting in the streets by the bad guys and the good guys, we will take that time and we will end it, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other speakers used even stronger terms in urging the organization to use the shooting death of the unarmed black teenager as a call to action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's killing was nothing more than a modern-day lynching. George Zimmerman became the judge, the jury and the executioner of an innocent child,&quot; said Joe Madison, a former board member of the NAACP. Madison, known as &quot;The Black Eagle,&quot; hosts &quot;The Urban View&quot; Sirius/XM morning radio show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't let Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death just be a moment. It has to become a movement,&quot; Madison continued, comparing Martin to civil rights martyrs Medgar Evers and Emmett Till and promising to remember him on the 50th anniversary of the &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech at a march in Washington on Aug. 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is (Martin's) blood and their sacrifice that you shouldn't forget,&quot; Madison said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evers was a civil rights activist in Mississippi who was shot in the back on June 12, 1963, as he stood in his driveway after a day of trying to get black Mississippi voters registered. Byron de la Beckwith, a member of the White Citizens' Council, was charged with Evers' murder that month, but juries composed solely of white men deadlocked in the case twice that year. Thirty-one years later, de la Beckwith was brought to trial on new evidence and convicted of murder; he died in prison in 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Till was a 14-year-old from Chicago visiting relatives in Mississippi in August 1955 when he was beaten and shot, allegedly for whistling at a white woman. After he was pulled from the Tallahatchie River, his mother held an open-casket funeral, and photographs of his mutilated body, published in Jet magazine, shocked blacks and whites across America. Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam were tried and acquitted by an all-white jury in 1955. In June 2004, the U.S. Justice Department reopened the case, but it declined to file new charges in 2006, as did a Mississippi grand jury in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was shot in the chest on a rainy night as he walked from a convenience story to his father's house in a gated townhome community in Sanford on Feb. 26, 2012. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, called police to report a suspicious person, then got out of his vehicle to follow Martin, though a dispatcher told him, &quot;We don't need you to do that.&quot; Zimmerman's attorneys argued Zimmerman shot Martin in self-defense after Martin attacked him, and a jury of five white women and one black Hispanic woman decided the prosecution failed to prove Zimmerman guilty of second-degree murder or manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, a Tallahassee lawyer who represents Martin's family, accused Zimmerman of profiling Martin because he was black and told the NAACP audience Monday that it was another civil rights battle to be fought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the neighborhood watch volunteer was allowed to profile, get out of his car and pursue any 'suspicious looking person' based on what he was wearing and how he looked. That is a scary proposition. The U.S. Supreme Court has said that the police cannot profile people. So are we going to let ordinary citizens profile our children?&quot; Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged the audience to maintain pressure on the U.S. Justice Department as it reviews the case. &quot;It seems like we're still fighting the fight that we fought so many years ago that we thought we won, yet here we are again crying out for equal justice,&quot; Crump said. &quot;If we're not vocal and vigilant then Trayvon's death is going to be swept under the rug.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP and MoveOn.org have amassed nearly 1 million signatures demanding that the Justice Department charge Zimmerman with a federal hate crime in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, activists are focused on the petition and intend to discuss it with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who will appear at the convention today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a chance to really push, especially if we meet the 1 million signature mark before then, to put the pressure on him to ensure that the Department of Justice acts swiftly,&quot; said Sean Dugar, an NAACP regional director from Oakland, Calif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young NAACP leaders also have started &quot;A Child Was Shot Yesterday&quot; campaign modeled after another campaign decades ago in which flags bearing the words, &quot;A Man Was Lynched Yesterday,&quot; were flown above the NAACP's New York office. Dugar was among those distributing yellow rubber bracelets imprinted with the message to conventioneers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activists are also using the Zimmerman case to combat gun violence. Changing the state's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law is mentioned as an issue in an email promoting a &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; rally planned today in Tallahassee by a coalition of left-leaning groups, including the Florida New Majority and Dream Defenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 24-year-old NAACP Midwestern Regional Director Kameron Middlebrooks of Des Moines, who called Martin &quot;our generation's Emmett Till,&quot; urged a push for legislative action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rallies are fine. Those are good,&quot; Middlebrooks said. &quot;But it's really about, how do we push people to action? Some of the action we want folks to take is dealing with racial profiling within their states and their local districts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reducing gun violence, including changing &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws, was one of three priorities for the NAACP, along with voting rights and restoration of voting rights for felons, said Jealous, who took over as head of the organization in 2008. In Florida, one of a handful states where felons who have completed their prison time do not automatically have their rights restored, felons must wait five years before applying to get their rights back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jealous' predecessor Julian Bond, a leader of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, said activists need to keep doing what they been doing for the past 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Coalition, litigation and agitation, which are the things we've always done,&quot; Bond said. &quot;In January of next year, somebody is going to say x, y, z is the new civil rights. And somebody else will say no, x, y, z is the new civil rights. There is no new civil rights. It's all the same thing. We need to keep doing more of what we've done.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race still has enormous power to divide Americans. In the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, there is deep disagreement over whether race played a role and, if it did, how it affected events from the time George Zimmerman spotted Mr. Martin on Feb. 26 of last year to Saturday's acquittal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one has proved that Mr. Zimmerman targeted Mr. Martin because of race. No one has proved that Seminole County prosecutors were reluctant to charge Mr. Zimmerman because the death of a black youth by a white man was of less concern than the shooting of a white victim would have been. No one has proved that the sloppy initial police investigation resulted from disregard for a black victim. No one has shown that Florida's misguided &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which at first gave police and prosecutors cover to do nothing, is more likely to be invoked when the shooter is white and the victim is black. No one has proved that the six jurors have stereotypical views about young black males who wear hoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if such issues did not dominate during testimony, they have made a strong circumstantial case from the start. They show that the debate about race in America continues to be intense. They show that Americans, even after re-electing a black president, must face this issue. Racism, real or perceived, can undermine faith in justice. In the worst case, it can subvert justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Internet seethes with comments on Mr. Zimmerman's acquittal. He can't be a racist because he's part Hispanic. He can't be innocent because he's white and killed a black child. The state suppressed evidence that would show Mr. Zimmerman used racial epithets to describe Mr. Martin. The state charged Mr. Zimmerman only because of undue pressure from black agitators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all such comments are from anonymous, online posts. Zimmerman defense attorney Mark O'Mara claimed, ludicrously, that his client &quot;never would have been charged with a crime&quot; if he were black. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Martin family, compared this case to the 1955 lynching in Mississippi of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black boy whose murderers said he had whistled at a white woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if it is impossible to say with certainty that racism triggered any single link in the chain of events that ended with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin dead and George Zimmerman acquitted, we think the conclusion is inescapable that race played a role. Put yourself in the place of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents. What if it had been your child, unarmed and walking home from the store? Would you believe that justice has been achieved if the armed man who provoked the fatal confrontation had gotten off?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, his family and defense team hope his days as a defendant are over. Perhaps they will be. That will depend on whether Mr. Martin's family decides to file a civil suit and whether the Justice Department decides to pursue a civil rights prosecution. It is certain that the debate about race must not be over. Shouting about race won't help close the divide. Talking about race might.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Monday's editorial, &quot;No definition of justice,&quot; The Post joined the chorus clamoring for George Zimmerman to be brought up on charges of civil rights violations. In this, The Post joins with those champions of American justice, the Revs. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America has been steadily climbing out of the &quot;old days,&quot; when civil rights violations were abundant and obvious. This is not one of those cases. To repeat the results of the fair and proper trial would do no good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post is saying, along with the above-mentioned black leaders and NAACP Chairman Benjamin Jealous, that since Mr. Zimmerman was found not guilty, we need to punish him for something. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was black, George Zimmerman was white. Ipso facto, there was a violation of Trayvon's civil rights. That kind of reasoning fails the common- sense test. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution brought all its resources to bear to convict George Zimmerman. A jury of six women, most of whom are mothers, found him not guilty. Nobody accused this jury of &quot;nullification,&quot; as happened in the O.J. Simpson murder case. George Zimmerman was a local activist trying to help protect his small community. Whatever evidence was presented supported the idea that, if anything, he is not a racist. It will be interesting to see how U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder responds to the facts on the grounds of this case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the Zimmerman verdict, Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat tweeted, &quot;What do I tell my sons?&quot; Mr. Wade, I recommend you tell your two wonderful sons: &quot;In your lifetime, boys, you will encounter a few white, misinformed people who will wrongly and negatively profile you. To defuse a situation, politely and articulately explain your situation. That will teach the 'creepy white dude' a much better lesson than a sucker punch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outrage doesn't trump self-defense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The George Zimmerman case was flawed in that the rage portion was not decoupled from the self-defense portion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, the 17-year-old might have been enraged about being followed, and George Zimmerman might have been overzealous in doing so. However, that does not give the person enraged the right to attack the person against whom his rage is directed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the rage portion ended and the attack portion started, it was an entirely different circumstance. It became a matter of self-defense, regardless of whether the rage was justified. Therefore, George Zimmerman had every right to defend himself against serious bodily harm or death, so the jury reached the right decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the charges against George Zimmerman should never have been brought. It resulted in unjust expenses and a ruining of George Zimmerman's life because he did what was reasonably necessary to protect his life. We do not need unjust &quot;show trials.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The much-publicized George Zimmerman case has finally come to a conclusion, and I've been appalled by this racially charged case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman has a racially mixed bloodline, and should be the last person to be accused of racial prejudice. Unfortunately, there has been added to this mix Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, two men who could never be compared to Dr. Martin Luther King. These two men are professional blacks who have capitalized on their race and have muddied the waters of the Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am glad the Zimmerman case is over. It never should have started. I can only hope that our media will get back to reporting the news instead of shaping it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a difference 20 years make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two decades ago, when two police officers were found not guilty of beating Rodney King (two others were found guilty), south-central Los Angeles went up in flames. Rioting spread to nearby Compton and Watts, and finally to Long Beach, where I lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just blocks from my house, scared shop owners spent nights on their rooftops with guns in hand to protect their property. We weren't allowed out after 9 p.m. The experience made clear what a thin veneer civil order is, and how easily it can break down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were similar fears when the Zimmerman verdict was announced. I held my breath, but what happened? Almost nothing but peaceful demonstrations nationwide protesting what millions of people consider a gross injustice. Why the measured reaction? Perhaps the joint news conference by the African-American police chief of Sanford and the white Seminole County sheriff had a calming effect. Or perhaps it was because in the past 20 years, African-Americans have taken their full, rightful place in America's political life, culminating in the election of the first African-American president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or maybe it was the collective memory of south-central Los Angeles on fire and the desire not to repeat that horror. Whatever the reason, America has taken a huge step forward in political maturity and today I'm very proud of my country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope the &quot;wannabe cop&quot; George Zimmerman never becomes a law enforcement officer. Neighborhood watch volunteers are not supposed to carry a weapon, yet Mr. Zimmerman carried a concealed weapon. He called to report and was told not to follow the person in question. He knew the police were on their way. How would you feel if you were being followed by a stranger when you were walking home?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can understand the jury feeling reasonable doubt about Mr. Zimmerman's guilt, but whose fault is it that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin does not have a life to live?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can defend myself with a gun if I feel my life is threatened. So I am walking along a dark street, someone steps out of the dark to confront me and I feel threatened. My life is in danger (?) so I shoot. After the fact, I find that the person only wanted directions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the law say that I must justify my feeling of being threatened? With this law in effect, I can't see how Mr. Zimmerman could have been found guilty, even if we believe the law to be stupid. This kind of thing was bound to happen with &quot;stand your ground.&quot; But the Florida Legislature is not thinking about the impact of the law. It is just a matter of time until this happens again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call me foolhardy, but I am glad not to live in a community &quot;protected&quot; by a watch volunteer who does not obey orders and who carries a loaded, concealed weapon. Perhaps what he did does not fit the legal definitions of second-degree murder or manslaughter, but dead is dead. Just keep him away from me.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Scottish Verdict' more appropriate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not guilty and don't do it again&quot; is how the locals jokingly characterize what is elsewhere known as the &quot;Scottish Verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Scotland, there are three possible verdicts in a criminal case: &quot;guilty,&quot; &quot;not guilty&quot; and &quot;not proven,&quot; the last being the unique &quot;Scottish Verdict.&quot; Although there are problems with this verdict, since it implies guilt with no subsequent option for the accused to clear his or her name, the &quot;not proven&quot; verdict would seem to have been appropriate in the George Zimmerman case, and would have led to less dissatisfaction than the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the Zimmerman verdict: The jurors were technically correct in their finding. They followed the law to the letter, and are to be congratulated and exonerated on all counts. I offer my gratitude for their effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personally, I believe George Zimmerman knows that what he did was ugly and wrong. May he suffer for the rest of his days for taking the life of an innocent boy to satisfy his skewed sense of justice. He won the battle, but lost the war. Ugly is just plain ugly, no matter how your lawyers present it. And the &quot;Lord&quot; whom George claims to follow is surely disgusted with him as well. He has no reason to be proud of his verdict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a miscarriage of justice that the jury didn't convict George Zimmerman of at least manslaughter (&quot;Zimmerman is acquitted in killing of Florida teen,&quot; Sunday). Part of the problem was the way the Florida law is written. But still it was the wrong verdict. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is dead and Zimmerman doesn't have to spend a day in jail. It's not at all right or just.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The jury discounted or ignored several inconsistencies in the story that Zimmerman told about the event. If Zimmerman was being held down by Martin, how could Zimmerman have had the ability to reach around to his back, pull out the gun, disengage the safety, and, finally, shoot Martin? If the safety was disengaged before the scuffle, then that means to me that Zimmerman intended to kill Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The day of the murder was a sad, sad day, as was the day of Zimmerman's acquittal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andrew C. Mills, Lower Gwynedd</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wrong to try Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the death of a young man is tragic, the only positive outcome of George Zimmerman's trial is that justice was done. This case should never have come to court. The original Sanford, Fla., chief of police refused to arrest Zimmerman, and for that lost his job. The whole affair then changed from seeking justice to bowing to political pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prosecution tried a cocktail of charges. Couple this with the prosecutors' histrionics and blatant attempts to inflame the jury - all but one of whom were mothers - by repeatedly referring to 17-year-old Martin as a &quot;child,&quot; and you could see that they knew they had no real case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fortunately, the jury based its verdict on the evidence and the law. Martin, who was taller and had an athletic build, though he weighed less than Zimmerman, could have disclosed that he lived in one of the houses in the complex. That would have been the end of the matter. Instead, clearly he intended to teach this &quot;cracker&quot; a lesson. As the jury concluded, Zimmerman acted within the law by using deadly force only when he reasonably felt that he was about to be killed or seriously injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nick O'Dell, Phoenixville, nickodell16@yahoo.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Should fear young black men</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our sons are in far more danger from their black brothers than they are from a white Latino vigilante. The vast majority of all blacks murdered are killed by black assailants. Chicago had several shootings of black residents on the Fourth of July by black attackers. Tell me, are the press and Al Sharpton there yet?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Philadelphia, every year, hundreds of young black men murder hundreds of young black men. It is important to be afraid of young black men in Philadelphia. Before spending so much energy on the afraid-of-black-people syndrome, we must solve the blacks-killing-blacks problem. Surely, that will produce the greatest gain and save the most lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maynard Honesty, Chesterbrook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman was doing his job</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I could not help but notice that your editorial Monday (&quot;Zimmerman's acquittal shouldn't lead to riches&quot;) said George Zimmerman was &quot;looking for trouble.&quot; Isn't anyone involved in a neighborhood watch program looking to prevent trouble?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tim Byrne, Wayne</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Verdict came out of the 1950s</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, the Voting Rights Act is dismantled, and now this. It feels as if we've gone back to the 1950s, when black people had to fight for the right to vote and white men who murdered an innocent black child for whistling at a white woman were found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case is about so many things. It's about laws that let anyone carry guns. It's about a Florida law that let's people shoot to kill if they feel threatened. It's about a court that was allowed to use that law to exonerate a man who was in the safety of his car, got out, stalked an innocent black child, and then claimed that he felt threatened. Needless to say, it's about racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a country where there's no money to educate children in cities like Philadelphia and Chicago, but plenty of money to build prisons where the majority of the inmates are young black and Latino men who did not commit violent crimes and never had the chance for a solid education, the justice system cannot convict a man who murdered an innocent child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sixty years after Emmett Till, this is where we are. But Emmett Till's murder mobilized people all over the country, and helped it to change some laws and face some ugly truths about itself. Let's hope that we as citizens can work toward making that happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Karen Falcon, Philadelphia, jubilleschool@verizon.net</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Real problem is jury trials</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My comments on the George Zimmerman case would be the same regardless of the verdict. Why is our jury system better than, for example, a panel of professional judges (perhaps three)? Chances are that the jurors know very little about the relevant law. Yes, the judge instructs them, but the law under review is often very complicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, jurors are not necessarily used to the pressure involved in some of these cases, and that stress may influence their judgment. The lawyers play to the emotions of the jurors. The game goes to the higher-priced lawyers, who know how to manipulate an inexperienced jury regardless of guilt or innocence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I fail to see any advantage in being judged by a jury of my peers. If I'm innocent of the charge, I would much rather take my chances with a panel of professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richard McFadden Sr., Plymouth Meeting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guilty of walking while black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In my day, if you had a fist fight, you took your licks and walked away. Now, if someone gets the upper hand, you shoot him and tell the law you were afraid the guy was going to beat you to death. So what if you provoked the whole situation by confronting a kid who was walking home and minding his own business?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was &quot;walking while black,&quot; wearing a hoodie, in the rain, through a white neighborhood already terrified by other black men. When in doubt, shoot first and ask questions later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> George Zimmerman didn't stand his ground. He stood on Martin's ground and provoked the confrontation. Neither all the slickest lawyers in the world or the dumbest sitting juries will ever convince me that this innocent kid should be six feet under.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anthony Frascino, Swedesboro</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sidewalks are deadly weapons?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As if I ever really felt safe from any gun-toting yahoo who might choose to harass me, the acquittal of George Zimmerman, and the absurd arguments used to support that result, will only make me more paranoid. Nobody can feel safe knowing that he may be considered dangerous just for walking on a public sidewalk, which is now considered a deadly weapon that is worthy of retaliation with firearms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE JURY followed the law in the George Zimmerman trial, so the defendant is now free to pick up his gun and invisible badge and start following more kids around the neighborhood on dark and rainy nights.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trayvon Martin case, and Saturday's verdict, sticks in the craw of many Americans - many for reasons of race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(In fact, Attorney General Eric Holder may be pursuing separate federal civil-rights charges.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman still hasn't provided a reasonable explanation for why he regarded Martin as a threat. Defense witnesses testified that Zimmerman sometimes helped black people. So, yes, when he wasn't shooting unarmed black teens, it seems he was a pretty good guy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's useful to remember that Zimmerman wouldn't have been in a position to kill anybody, for any reason, had he not been running around with a loaded gun - a gun with no safety, and a round already in the chamber, which should tell you something about his state of mind and his competence as a self-appointed town watchman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, the Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms. But the Second Amendment isn't the only amendment. And a gun is not a magic wand that, when brandished, deprives other people of their rights. Martin, minding his own business in front of his father's house, had a right to life and liberty, and gun-slingin' Zimmerman took those things from Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the trial, Zimmerman sat dumbly and watched as his attorneys further savaged Martin by attacking the dead young man's character. Often ludicrously. Martin, we learned, smoked dope. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which made us wonder: If everyone in America exchanged his gun for an ounce of marijuana, would we be a more dangerous country, or a less dangerous country? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's loaded, ready-to-fire gun didn't make him safer. It emboldened him, fed his law-enforcement fantasies, led him to pursue a blameless boy even after police dispatchers told him not to. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And allowed him to kill the only other witness to the incident. And so a message is sent: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can arm yourself, follow whom you please, kill them if things get out of hand, and, so long as there are no witnesses, you can provide your own self-exonerating version of events. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a folksy admonition in America that's been around as long as guns: Don't go off half-cocked. Yet, that's what Zimmerman did, running into the night after a teenager, his safetyless 9 mm fully loaded and ready to fire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The words of the dispatcher linger: &quot;Are you following him? We don't need you to do that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman did anyway, and when things didn't go his way, when life exposed the gap between his Steven Seagal fantasies and reality, when he realized that he was a &quot;soft&quot; fat little busybody on the wrong end of a beat-down, he pulled a gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law says he's not guilty. The law stinks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because everybody knows, or should know, that getting your ass kicked in a confrontation that you initiate is not a good enough reason for killing someone. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'M WHITE. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was black. George Zimmerman, a ringer for many of my immigration clients, is Latino. These should all be irrelevant factors. But of course, they're not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We kid ourselves if we truly believe that America is a melting pot that creates a benign and savory stew that nourishes the pilgrim soul in each of us. America's story has been written by different hands with different perspectives and different desires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sometimes, on July 4 for example, we can pretend that this great land of ours is unified and impervious to fracture. We just celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, a crucible in which the blood of patriots guaranteed the political survival of &quot;The United States.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But we have always been blessed and cursed by living side by side with &quot;the other,&quot; and it is futile to expect that we will ever fully escape the demanding, sometimes brutal requirements of diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president, in a fit of eloquence, once told us that there is no red America and no blue America. That is debatable. But what he could never deny is that there </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">is</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a white America and a black America. That single dividing line is greater than the chasm separating man from woman, Catholic from Jew, gay from straight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Race will never be irrelevant. The epidermal Rashomon will be perpetuated, with blacks seeing the world one way and whites seeing it another, well into the next century, and the next. It is naive to believe otherwise, even as we pray for a post-racial society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just look at the letter to the editor that appeared on these pages yesterday, penned by a black reader who chastised my favorite columnist, Stu Bykofsky, for unrealistically believing that white parents could raise a minority child. As a white woman, I fully believe that I could give love and a sense of purpose to a black child. I am offended at the suggestion that I couldn't, or wouldn't want to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And yet this reader had his or her reasons to suggest that someone with my skin color and experience would be incapable of fortifying a dark-skinned boy against the dangers and challenges of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of those who are protesting the verdict in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case obviously feel the same way. For them, the only reason that a 17-year-old is dead is because he was targeted by a &quot;white&quot; man (someone as &quot;white&quot; as our president, by the way).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many others who praised the verdict acquitting George Zimmerman of murder do so, I suspect, because they resent the fact that they themselves have been called racist for worrying about their safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Who is to blame either group for bringing their personal experiences, grievances and expectations to this tragic event?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And yet, while divided, there is something that unites us and has - not perfectly but well - protected us for more than 200 centuries. That is the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A jury has rendered its decision, finding that under the law as explained to them by experts, Zimmerman was not guilty of murder or manslaughter. We may disagree, as I bitterly disagreed when O.J. Simpson was acquitted and when a woman I still consider a murderer, Casey Anthony, walked free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But we are obligated to respect the decision of those jurors, because it is only this tenuous legal thread that keeps us from dissolving into a land of Babel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Contrary to what the race baiters like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton are saying whenever they can steal a microphone from a legitimate commentator, we are not a country that hunts young black men. We are a country where the conditions of society make life considerably riskier for black youth, where economics and history combine to place them in jeopardy, where their own willingness to self-destruct renders them potential statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this does not mean that Zimmerman should pay for that. It is only the law and its proper application that would have had the right to condemn Zimmerman to a prison cell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few weeks ago, I wrote about my father, who went down south to Mississippi during the civil-rights movement and faced a KKK roadblock. A black woman sent me an email saying that she admired dad for &quot;choosing&quot; to do the right thing for racial equality, but that her own father had no &quot;choice&quot; in facing the men in white sheets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When I read that, I realized that we will never fully be able to get into the minds and hearts of those with different histories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's only human.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the law is different. She must be blind so that the rest of us can see clearly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is over. Eric Holder and the people who continue to protest and demand &quot;justice&quot; need to realize that it's staring us in the face. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE DAILY NEWS is one of the &quot;mad scientists,&quot; described by George Zimmerman's defense attorney, who went to work on Zimmerman without knowing all the facts. Elmer Smith does a decent job of at least allowing the other side to be mentioned in his column. But if you are going to take the prosecution's case and say that it portrayed Zimmerman as a &quot;hate-filled racist,&quot; then that needs to be backed up. Of course, you then claim it was &quot;over the top,&quot; but the prosecutors never alluded to Zimmerman being a racist. When, Mr. Smith, did either prosecutor portray George Zimmerman as racist? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer is, they did not. The answer is, the prosecutors did a fantastic job of putting on a trial with little facts to support their accusations. I understand the racial-divide components here, but if white people were all so racist, wouldn't we be pulling for Zimmerman, a Hispanic, to be arrested? One dead black kid and a Hispanic in jail for 20 years sounds like a racist's birthday wish.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no, in almost every interview of any protesters anywhere in the country, you hear Zimmerman described as white. President Obama is white then, too. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ridley Park, Pa. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's sad that a young man is dead. But to hear the Rev. Jesse Jackson say that this wasn't a jury of his peers because it was all women and not a black man on it . . . didn't the state have a say in who sits on the jury? I think so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's sad to hear CNN speak about how happy people are that there is no violence - there isn't supposed to be any! That would be acting like animals. Just because it didn't go their way, OK, let's destroy property. Duh! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White people didn't do that when O.J. got off. Everybody knows he did it! I would like to see Jackson and the Rev. Al Sharpton go to high-crime areas and stay there for a week, not just one day for a photo shoot. Then maybe they can make a difference in those areas where there is a lot of black-on-black crime. Why isn't there a national march on that? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is a disgrace. There are killings everyday in the 'hood. No one death is more important than another. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just ask any mother, who has lost a child. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philadelphia </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find it ironic that Judge Debra Nelson, in her judicial wisdom, deemed it plausible to consider, in charging the jury in the George Zimmerman case, with the charge of manslaughter when at the trial's inception the prosecution sought the crime to be second-degree murder. I've followed the trial from a print standpoint and also on nightly news broadcasts, and I believe that the prosecution's case has been weak and the defense case has been overwhelmingly presented in a manner that portrays George Zimmerman as a concerned &quot;neighborhood watchman&quot; and not the vigilante that the prosecution has attempted to portray. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, as a retired Philadelphia police officer, it appears to me that the media has been trying to foster the notion that the entire trial was a racial issue. The fear of racial violence, should a not-guilty verdict have been handed down, should not have clouded the jury's decision to decide guilt or innocence on the evidence presented by the prosecution or defense. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philadelphia </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is with great sadness that a man killed another man and got away with it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plain and simple, George Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon Martin. He got out of his car and got into a fistfight with the young man. He probably was losing the fight and shot the young man. Rightfully so, he should have been locked up, but those six jurors just did not want to stay there any longer and examine the facts. They pretended that they were examining, but I assume their minds were already made up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department needs to redo that case and this time pick jurors who are sincere. I think a law-enforcement officer should have been one of the jurors, and if they did not know the law or were not sure, he could have answered any of their questions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last thing we need is to have people walking around carrying guns because they are afraid the same thing might happen to them or for some stupid reason. We do not need people thinking that they can get away with shooting another person and use Zimmerman's trial as an example. We need to let our law-enforcement officers do their job. They are trained professionals who are very good. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emotions are running very high, and rightfully so, but by the same token we need lots of patience, and not react too fast to anger - to pause for 10-20 seconds, take deep breaths and, most of all, pray. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'M REMINDED of Vince Lombardi's quote, &quot;Leaders are made, they are not born,&quot; when I think of how a local entrepreneur was drafted into leading Sunday's protest in Center City against George Zimmerman's acquittal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Norris, 26, had no intention of doing anything. After hearing the heart-wrenching news that Zimmerman had been found not guilty of second-degree murder for shooting unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, he took himself off the grid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Norris turned off his phone. Unplugged from social media, he holed up in his South Philly rowhouse. It was only when he tried to order pizza that the 2004 graduate of University City High School discovered he was being inundated with texts and phone messages. One of them was from Mannwell Glenn of the Philadelphia Unemployment Project, who told him, &quot;Listen, man, you're a leader. . . . Chris, you've got to do something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That got Norris going. He jumped on social media to spread the word about Sunday afternoon's protest. Hours later, he was at LOVE Park giving media interviews and watching as similarly outraged Philadelphians flooded the iconic park, many carrying signs blasting the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This could have been any of us,&quot; Norris told Clear Channel's Loraine Ballard Morrill during a videotaped interview before the rally. &quot;I've been in the situation where Trayvon was. I know people who have been in the situations where Trayvon was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trayvon had gone out for candy the night he was killed. Zimmerman's acquittal after a three-week trial sparked nationwide outrage and protests in cities around the country. Locally, demonstrators were fired up but peaceful. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It didn't hurt that this was something of a repeat performance for Norris, who in 2012 organized a similar demonstration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's when I first noticed Norris, a professional drummer who performs under the stage name Flood the Drummer. He's also the founder of Techbook Online, which he describes as a socially conscious news organization. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The next time I found myself watching him was this past spring after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Philadelphia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> magazine's publication of an offensive article, &quot;Being White in Philly.&quot; Instead of just being annoyed by a piece that allowed anonymous sources to cast aspersions against black residents, Norris marched into the offices of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Philadelphia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People were upset,&quot; Norris recalled. &quot;I thought, why not go and talk to David Lipson, who was the president of the company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's Norris. He's not afraid to raise his hand and say, &quot;I'll do it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I tell the guy all the time, you are the next wave,&quot; said Glenn, 50. &quot;His heart is in the right place. He's not governed by money or any kind of exposure. He doesn't want to be the main guy at the microphone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was clear Sunday as Glenn urged the crowd to boycott Florida, where the verdict went down. Protesters milled around applauding. Meanwhile, Norris, who was the man of the hour, was nowhere near the stage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, July 16 -- A Florida jury's acquittal of George Zimmerman, a white-Hispanic neighbourhood watch volunteer, in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin has sparked off protests in cities across America, triggering a renewed national debate over racial profiling and use of guns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large crowds took to the streets in New York, Washington, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta and several other cities, decrying the verdict as a miscarriage of justice. They chanted and carried placards, demanding: &quot;Jail racist killers, not black youth,&quot; &quot;Justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin: It's not over&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With passions running high, the Department of Justice has begun a review of the case to determine if criminal civil rights charges can be brought against Zimmerman, who was accused of profiling Martin before the altercation that led to the fatal shooting in a gated community in Sanford, Florida on February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confirming the federal move, the department said in a statement that its civil rights division will review the evidence from the FBI and the Florida trial. &quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, there is a possibility of the Martin family coming up with a civil suit against Zimmerman, who was acquitted of the charges of second-degree murder as well as the lesser charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growing anger prompted President Barack Obama to issue an appeal for calm. Terming Martin's death a tragedy not just for his family and one community, but for the whole of America, Obama said: &quot;But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities. We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People) is spearheading the protests, with support from a host of civil rights groups. In a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, the NAACP said that with the acquittal of Zimmerman, it was now time for his department to act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department says it's considering criminal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman in the aftermath of his acquittal in the shooting of Trayvon Martin. But its resources, and those of the public, would be far better spent investigating prosecutory misconduct for a political prosecution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, 29, a Hispanic, was found not guilty late Saturday in the February 2012 death of Mr. Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old, in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman claimed self-defense. The jury obviously found enough reasonable doubt - the legal standard - that it could not abide the prosecution's second-degree murder charge or even a lesser charge of manslaughter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this case was a political prosecution from the start. The local police chief who, based on the facts declined to file charges, was forced from office. The Seminole-Broward County state's attorney said Zimmerman acted in self-defense. But that wasn't good enough for those calling for Zimmerman's head. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under pressure, Gov. Rick Scott appointed a special prosecutor, Angela Cory. And there are credible allegations that she did not disclose pertinent evidence that, exculpatory to Zimmerman, appears to affirm earlier decisions not to charge him. (A staffer in her office was fired for disclosing some of that information.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are allegations that the Justice Department aided in anti-Zimmerman protests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America's system of criminal justice is seriously broken,&quot; F.H. Buckley, a law professor at George Mason University, writes about the case in The American Spectator. But certainly not for the reasons that post-verdict protesters have been citing. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a society still fractured along lines of black and white, Americans knew, going into the murder trial of George Zimmerman, that the eventual verdict would infuriate someone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so the acquittal Saturday of the Sanford, Fla., crime watch volunteer, whose father is white and whose mother is Hispanic, in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager, was followed by rallies the next day in various cities, including Pittsburgh. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of those who took to the streets were orderly, yet outraged over a case in which a 17-year-old carrying nothing more than Skittles and a can of iced tea could be fatally shot without his killer being found guilty of a crime. The jury of six women, all but one of them white, did not beyond a reasonable doubt convict Mr. Zimmerman of second-degree murder or a lesser charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case stemming from the February 2012 shooting was infused with racial politics, but there was more to this tragedy than that. It also turned on how far a gun-toting crime watch member should go in monitoring an unknown person in the neighborhood, and it raised the question yet again of how to keep innocent citizens safe from a growing culture of guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, who was on patrol that night in a community that had seen a rash of break-ins, told a police dispatcher during a 911 call that he spotted a teenager who looked suspicious. The dispatcher advised Mr. Zimmerman not to confront or follow the youth and that police would be on the scene. Instead, Mr. Zimmerman got into a scuffle with Mr. Martin and said later that he shot him in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors' assignment was to uphold the laws of Florida, through the prism of the case that unfolded in the courtroom -- not the one seen on the nation's TV screens or framed by the endless parade of talking heads. Without sitting through every minute of the trial, it is not fair for the public to take issue with how the judge and jury did their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the shooting, President Barack Obama injected himself into the case when he said, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot; Yet on Sunday he offered perhaps the wisest counsel on the trial's outcome -- &quot;we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some have said the verdict calls for more conversation in this country. The president challenged Americans to ask &quot;if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding&quot; and &quot;if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We question whether &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws like the one in Florida and &quot;castle&quot; laws like the one in Pennsylvania, which expand protections for gun use, invite unnecessary violence and unexpected tragedy. We are concerned about crime in all neighborhoods, whether the victims or the perpetrators are black or white, young or old, rich or poor. And we are impatient for the day when the opportunities of good education and family-sustaining jobs will be truly available to all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the conversation America should be having after the verdict on George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When in 1992 a California jury acquitted the four officers who beat Rodney King, the result was a race riot of a kind not seen since the late 1960s -- followed by a federal civil-rights prosecution that convicted two of the officers. The acquittal of George Zimmerman for killing Trayvon Martin hasn't produced rioting, but it has spawned a growing demand, led by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, for a federal trial to re-charge Mr. Zimmerman with violating Mr. Martin's civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laws have changed since 1992 to make bringing such a prosecution easier than it would once have been. Yet the likelihood of getting a conviction would be extremely small -- and instead of placating people who feel aggrieved by the first trial, another failed prosecution might make race relations in America worse, not better. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In years past, it would have been difficult if not impossible to bring a federal civil-rights charge against a private citizen such as Mr. Zimmerman who attacked another citizen on the street. Civil rights crimes then extended to government officials acting under color of law or to private citizens who injured other citizens who were engaged in a set of federally protected activities. These included going to school, registering to vote or trying to make use of a public accommodation such as a lunch counter or soda fountain. The federal laws, in other words, were designed to cover the classic civil rights situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That changed in 2009, when Congress passed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. The law is often called the Matthew Shepard Act for short, and is best known for making it a crime to injure someone because of sexual orientation. But Mr. Byrd was an African-American murdered by white supremacists in Texas in 1998, and the law actually began by removing the requirement of a federally protected activity for racially motivated crimes. Under the act, bodily injury is a federal crime if &quot;committed because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin of any person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the surface, this clearly phrased law would seem to make conviction relatively straightforward. All the prosecution would have to do is show that Mr. Zimmerman's attack on Mr. Martin was racially motivated. There is no need to prove that Mr. Martin was on a public street or that Mr. Zimmerman was trying to deprive him of a civil right. Passed pursuant to Congress's authority under the 13th Amendment to remove all incidents and badges of slavery, the law also doesn't require the prosecution to show any awkward link to Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet how, exactly, would the federal government prove Mr. Zimmerman's motivation? Testimony from a former co-worker who claims that Mr. Zimmerman made racist, anti-Arab comments on the job would likely not be admissible. Mr. Zimmerman's possible racial slur on the tape of his conversation with the 911 operator while following Mr. Martin (arguably, &quot;coon&quot;) might conceivably be admitted as probative. But a single phrase that is difficult to interpret on the tape is unlikely to be enough to convince a jury that Mr. Martin's race was the cause for the attack. Even if a jury accepted that Mr. Zimmerman suspected Martin and pursued him because of his race, the defense attorneys would argue that the actual shooting was motivated by self-defense, not race. And one jury already apparently bought some version of the self-defense story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could be argued, with some force, that the Justice Department should bring federal charges even if the odds of success are slim. The fact of a federal prosecution would show that the government takes hate crimes seriously. Even with scant chances of success, the fact of prosecution might vindicate federal interest in preserving the right of everyone to walk the streets without being attacked, regardless of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trouble would arise when another jury -- as it probably would -- acquitted Mr. Zimmerman. Instead of the bottom-line message being that the government wants to protect all its citizens from hate crimes, events might underscore that in 2013, a white-appearing American can still shoot an unarmed African-American teenager and get away with it not once but twice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One acquittal could perhaps be explained away by the vagaries of the jury system or the particularities of the culture of self-defense as symbolized by Florida's stand-your-ground law. A second acquittal would mean something different. Because the charge would be that Mr. Zimmerman acted with racial animus, the verdict might be perceived as saying that the public didn't believe race was in issue here at all -- or worse, that the public didn't care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights laws are made to be used, and there's no escaping that they have a symbolic value alongside their practical effects. If you believe that Mr. Zimmerman killed Mr. Martin because of his race, it's easy to understand the appeal of the civil rights charge. The question for advocates, then, is simple: Would you still support bringing charges even if you believed Mr. Zimmerman would get off again? For the NAACP, the answer may be yes. But for the government, the decision to prosecute must also take account of the odds of success. The consequences of failure here are serious. This time, prudence might counsel letting the coin flip of the Florida jury verdict -- however outrageous -- stand as the last word.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six jurors rendering a verdict at George Zimmerman's trial weren't mind readers. They had no idea whether the doughy man who sat at the defendant's table mastering a vacant expression throughout the trial was guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All they knew for sure was that he was a killer -- that much wasn't in dispute. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question before them was whether the defendant, the admitted killer of an unarmed 17-year-old boy, was guilty of &quot;depraved indifference&quot; when he shot and killed Trayvon Benjamin Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was it self-defense that prompted George Zimmerman to pull the trigger -- or was it some darker impulse? Because the defendant chose not to testify on his own behalf, the inconsistencies in his previous accounts of what happened that night were a nettlesome abstraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Trayvon&nbsp;Martin dead and gone for more than 17 months, the only other person who could say what happened that evening chose to speak through legal surrogates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several weeks of hearing from neighbors on the periphery of the killing, the contradictory expert witnesses and defense and prosecution attorneys with their never-ending primers about what constituted reasonable doubt, the jury was ready to exercise its civic duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they received the judge's instructions about how to calculate various degrees of murder, the jurors were confronted with an unacknowledged moral conundrum -- how to weigh reasonable doubt without direct testimony from the killer about what he was feeling at the time of the shooting. They would have to content themselves with his testimony as mediated through the funhouse mirror of his lawyers' account of that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Zimmerman's lawyers, the now Buddha-like defendant was not the initial aggressor -- Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was. What had originally been a straightforward tale of an armed and overzealous neighborhood watch vigilante following and confronting a hoodie-wearing stranger in the apartment complex was turned on its head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the defense lawyers' hands, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin became a Skittles-wielding, Arizona Tea-swigging gangsta thug who, contrary to &quot;lies&quot; concocted in the media, stalked and violently accosted Mr. Zimmerman, who was purportedly the only one minding his own business that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant, who had studied mixed martial arts extensively, was allegedly such an inept fighter that the unarmed teenager demolished his defenses within seconds and had him on the ground, banging his head into concrete with ferocity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense team portrayed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as an urban Terminator -- a lanky, muscular, indefatigable hood warrior who made George Zimmerman cry while unloading haymakers to his face and head. In this scenario, the teenager reached for the defendant's gun. Only the beaten and humiliated man's quick shooting prevented him from being murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was up to the jury to determine whether the sophistry of the defense lawyers provided enough reasonable doubt to make the difference between sentencing their client to many decades in prison or granting his freedom. Would the lawyers' scenario overwhelm the jury's own sense of how the world works?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury knew George Zimmerman was a killer when they began their deliberations, but it was their duty to determine whether the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was justified under Florida law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They had the judge's instructions. They were swimming in a sea of law, legalese and the case's ugly, unstated subtext. It was a case about race, class and irrational fear of black men, but neither side dealt with those issues openly, only in code. It was a case that was more remarkable because of what was not said by either side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would it be easier for the jurors, with their own decades of biases and experiences, to put themselves in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's shoes or the defendant's? Which story was less preposterous to six women, given their own experience in the world? And with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin unable to testify and the defendant unwilling to, could they imagine a scenario in which the guy who emerged from the conflict alive was actually guilty? Could their imagination become an act of empathetic justice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense began the trial with a knock-knock joke that baffled everyone and insulted the jury's intelligence. Given the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict the jurors came to on Saturday night, it may have been weirdly prophetic:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Knock, knock. Who's there? George Zimmerman. George Zimmerman who? ... Alright good, you're on the jury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome to George Zimmerman's world, America. You're on the jury.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES -- Protesters ran through Los Angeles streets Monday night, breaking windows, attacking people on sidewalks and at one point raiding a Wal-Mart store, while others blocked a major freeway in the San Francisco Bay Area in the third night of demonstrations in California over George Zimmerman's Florida acquittal in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirteen people were arrested after multiple acts of vandalism and several assaults in Los Angeles' Crenshaw District, Mayor Eric Garcetti and Police Chief Charlie Beck said at a news conference. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They didn't elaborate on the assaults or any injuries, but at least one man could be seen in the street with a head injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 300 officers were called to the scene and were at first slow to directly engage protesters in an attempt to allow a peaceful end to the demonstration, Chief Beck said. But the chief said police would take a much stricter posture in the coming nights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, dozens of demonstrators briefly blocked all lanes of Interstate 880 at the tail end of rush hour, stopping traffic in both directions for several minutes before lanes were cleared by authorities. Several protesters left their bicycles on the ground in front of stopped cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The freeway protesters broke off from a larger group organized via social media that gathered at Oakland City Hall about an hour earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police made nine arrests for crimes including assault with a deadly weapon and vandalism, police spokeswoman Johnna Watson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman jurors initially split</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI -- As they began deliberating in George Zimmerman's murder trial, three of the six jurors wanted to acquit him while the other three wanted to convict him of either murder or manslaughter, one of the jurors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-woman jury ultimately voted to acquit Mr. Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman, known as Juror B37, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday that when the jury began deliberations Friday, they took an initial vote. Three jurors-- including B37 -- were in favor of acquittal, two supported manslaughter and one backed second-degree murder. She said the jury started going through all the evidence, listening to tapes multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why it took us so long,&quot; said B37, who said she planned to write a book about the trial but later had a change of heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they started looking at the law, the person who initially wanted second-degree murder changed her vote to manslaughter, the juror said. Then they asked for clarification from the judge and went over it again and again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B37 said some jurors wanted to find Mr. Zimmerman guilty of something, but there was just no place to go based on the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homebuilders optimistic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homebuilders are feeling more optimistic about their home sales prospects than they have in more than seven years, a trend that suggests home construction will accelerate in coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Association of Home Builders Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released today jumped to 57 this month from 51 in June. It was the third consecutive monthly gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reading above 50 indicates more builders view sales conditions as good, rather than poor. The index hasn't been that high since January 2006, well before the housing market crashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other economic reports released today:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Higher gasoline costs pushed a measure of consumer prices up in June. But the overall trend in inflation stayed tame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labor Department said that the consumer price index increased 0.5 percent in June from May. Two-thirds of the increase came from a 6.3 percent jump in gas prices, the largest since February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Factories cranked out more business equipment, home electronics and autos in June, boosting manufacturing output for the second straight month. The gains suggest factories may be starting to recover from a slow start this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve said that manufacturing production rose 0.3 percent in June from May. That followed a 0.2 percent gain the previous month. Still, the two consecutive gains barely offset production declines in March and April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall industrial production, which includes factories, mines and utilities, also rose 0.3 percent in June.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty years after federal prosecutors won prison sentences against two white Los Angeles police officers who beat motorist Rodney King, NAACP leaders and others Monday pushed for a similar effort following the Saturday acquittal in Florida court of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we're requesting is that the federal government comes in [and handles the Martin youth's death] as a civil rights issue,&quot; said Constance Parker, president of the Pittsburgh unit of the NAACP, in a telephone interview from Orlando, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was attending the organization's national convention not far from the Sanford courtroom in which six women acquitted Mr. Zimmerman, 29. &quot;We're asking that the federal government come in and look at the tragic death of this 17-year-old,&quot; Ms. Parker said. &quot;That's the only due process of the law that can handle this and take it further.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as cries for federal intervention resounded, though, experts said there are high hurdles federal officials have to overcome if they are to charge someone in conduct for which they have been acquitted at the state level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If a full and fair process occurred in the state, even if the result was an acquittal, then usually the presumption is you do not bring another case,&quot; said former U.S. attorney Harry Litman, who worked on the team that prosecuted King's assailants before he took the top Justice Department job in Pittsburgh. &quot;Based on past experience and the extremely rare instances in which the federal government comes in following a [state] trial of a non-governmental defendant, I think you'd have to see a federal prosecution here as a long shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman shot the unarmed Martin youth in the heart in February 2012. His legal team claimed self-defense, and the jury, apprised of Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, acquitted him of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The jury found that no one is guilty of the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. I find that to be a joke,&quot; said Ms. Parker, who added that her NAACP unit is planning a public event in Pittsburgh related to the case, likely late this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On what basis should the federal government prosecute Mr. Zimmerman? The Martin youth &quot;was profiled, and that violates his civil rights,&quot; Ms. Parker said. &quot;He was profiled as a young man, a black man, with a hoodie on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department issued a statement Sunday saying that the Criminal Section of its Civil Rights Division, along with the U.S. attorney for central Florida and the FBI, is evaluating the trial. Officials will &quot;determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes,&quot; according to the statement, and make a decision on prosecution based on the department's &quot;policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Double jeopardy doesn't bar federal prosecution of Mr. Zimmerman, because state and federal governments have separate sovereignty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the department's policy says that, generally, federal prosecutors don't charge people with things for which they have been acquitted at the state level. Exceptions, like the King case, occur when there's a &quot;substantial federal interest&quot; that was &quot;demonstrably unvindicated&quot; and where conviction is likely, according to the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy says state court's &quot;incompetence, corruption, intimidation or undue influence&quot; can justify the filing of federal charges following an acquittal, as can a jury's disregard for the evidence or the emergence of new information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, Attorney General Eric Holder would have to personally sign off on any federal prosecution of Mr. Zimmerman, according to the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorneys could not remember a local case in roughly a quarter-century in which a federal prosecutor second-guessed a state jury's decision. None of the attorneys interviewed, all of whom kept an eye on Mr. Zimmerman's trial on television or through other media, thought he would face federal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the nature of the case, the publicity that surrounded that case, the fact that it was talked about from one end of this country to the other ... that leads me to believe that all of the bases were probably covered by the prosecution,&quot; said Almon Burke, who was an assistant U.S. attorney for 23 years before he went into private practice last year. &quot;It wouldn't surprise me if the department decides not to pursue civil rights charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The King case involved accusations of racial animosity, and after a California jury found the police not guilty, the Justice Department filed federal civil rights charges. That case, though, included elements that weren't factors in the Martin youth's death, said Mr. Litman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Rodney King case, the civil right [involved] was the right to be free from an unlawful search and seizure,&quot; Mr. Litman said. In the Martin case, he said, the &quot;only plausible theory [of a civil rights violation] would be that it was an intentional killing because of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very rare for any reprosecution to happen. It's doubly rare for it to be on a civil rights charge that doesn't involve government actors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The King and Martin cases are similar in that they inspired heated public reactions, but Mr. Holder has to set that aside, according to Bruce Antkowiak, a former federal prosecutor and defense attorney who's now a professor of law at Saint Vincent College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're not supposed to make [a decision] on the basis of public opinion,&quot; he said. Prosecutors &quot;understand the devastating impact on any person of just being indicted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Could public opinion have an effect? Sure it could,&quot; said defense lawyer J. Alan Johnson, hastening to add that he did not make prosecutorial decisions based on outside pressure when he was the U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, was found not guilty of second-degree murder or manslaughter for shooting and killing black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. The decision by the all-female, six-person jury came more than a year after the incident, which triggered a strong response and led to a national dialogue on race and &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Event </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Feb. 26, 2012: Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, is shot and killed during a confrontation with neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, now 29, in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., a suburb of Orlando.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zimmerman calls 911 to report Martin, and the police dispatcher tells him there was no need to follow the Martin youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zimmerman follows Martin, and a fight ensues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Neighbors called 911 after hearing an altercation and a gunshot, and Zimmerman was taken into custody but was not arrested because he claimed self-defense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excluded evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Text messages taken from Martin's phone and an animation purporting to show the fight cannot be used. However, the Defense could use the animation as a demonstrative exhibit in their closings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Testimony from two audio experts for the prosecution about audio recording of a 911 call are excluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Martin's marijuana use, history of fights or high school suspension cannot be brought up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Judge Nelson tossed out Florida police detective Chris Serino's statement that he found Mr. Zimmerman credible in his description of fighting with Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence for Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The defense showed photos of Zimmerman's bruised head and face, which were taken after his fight with Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* John Good, who lived at the housing complex where Martin was killed, testified he saw someone in dark clothes straddling someone wearing white or red who was lying on the ground. (Zimmerman was wearing a red jacket that night.) The person on top, he said, used repeated arm motions moving downward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Public safety consultant Dennis Root testified that Martin was in better shape than Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Forensics expert Vincent DiMaio testified that the trajectory of the bullet and gun powder on Martin's body support Zimmerman's account that Martin was on top of him when he fatally shot the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, passed in 2005, allows Zimmerman to defend himself and meet force with force (including deadly force) if he felt it was necessary to prevent bodily harm, death or an imminent felony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Anthony Gorgone, a crime lab analyst with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, testified that he found no traces of Zimmerman's DNA in scrapings taken from Martin's fingernails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence against Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zimmerman used a 9 mm handgun to kill Martin, and the prosecution questioned why a volunteer would carry a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zimmerman did not have to put himself in the situation he did, as a 911 dispatcher told him there was no need to follow Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rachel Jeantel, 19, a friend of Martin's, spoke on the phone with Martin moments before he was killed and told the jury that Martin said he was being followed and tried to get away from the man pursuing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Florida Department of Law Enforcement analyst and firearms expert Amy Siewert testified that tearing and residue on Martin's clothing showed the gun was positioned directly against him when it fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Prosecutors said Zimmerman profiled Martin because of appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Prosecutors questioned how Zimmerman's skull have hit concrete 25 times, as he said, and sustained so few injuries and how Martin could have grabbed the gun and not left any DNA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial points</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Florida Supreme Court defines reasonable doubt as not merely possible doubt, speculative, imaginary or forced doubt. Jurors are told that if ? after carefully considering, comparing and weighing all the evidence, they do not have a stable, unwavering conviction of guilt, then the charge is not proved beyond every reasonable doubt and they must find the defendant not guilty because the doubt is reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Under the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guaranteed trial by a 12-member jury until the 1970 case Williams v. Florida, when it was decided that the Constitution did not require 12 jurors. Additionally, a Florida statute says &quot;twelve persons shall constitute a jury to try all capital cases, and six persons shall constitute a jury to try all other criminal cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aftermath</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* July 14, 2013: Protests planned in Boston, Detroit, Baltimore, San Francisco and other cities. At least one protest in California hours after the verdict late Saturday ended with vandalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama called the death of Martin a tragedy for the country and urged calm reflection, a message shared by religious and civil rights leaders hoping to ensure peaceful demonstrations in the wake of a case that became an emotional flash point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two rallies in Pittsburgh merged at the Hill Distict's Freedom Corner to speak out against the verdict, culminating with a sit-in that blocked Centre Avenue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 16--Pocono residents upset with George Zimmerman's acquittal are planning a peaceful vigil for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on Saturday in East Stroudsburg. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we really want to do is have the community come together. I know people have different opinions, but we want people who have different opinions to come together,&quot; said Cassie Tucker, who is organizing the vigil with her friend Akila Hayden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We just thought that justice wasn't served and instead of doing it violently by protesting, we wanted to do something that would bring peace to the whole community,&quot; Hayden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vigil will be held at 7 p.m. Saturday in front of the Bargain Book Warehouse across from Wal-Mart in East Stroudsburg and will include a balloon release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event is being called Justus (Justice) for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Balloon Release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The name of the event is a play on words, &quot;like 'just us' coming together,&quot; Tucker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hayden's sister, the Rev. Romanay Maureen Lashley of The Upper Room Anointed Word Ministry in Tobyhanna, will also say a few words at the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think my focal point will be to promote as much peace and prayer as possible,&quot; Lashley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's important for Trayvon's family, which is why I said peace and prayer -- keeping his family in our prayers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 16--A Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and of manslaughter in the shooting death of the black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Such a verdict seems inevitable now. There were no eyewitnesses, and a bullet to the chest silenced Trayvon forever. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the law, reasonable doubt exonerated Zimmerman, a self-appointed neighborhood watch type. Whether he learned anything from this exhausting and very public quest for justice is unknown. What's more important is whether the millions of people who followed the troubling case grasp the crux of the case: Vigilantism invites tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By all accounts, including his own, on Feb. 26, 2012, Zimmerman was out in his truck in his gated neighborhood in Sanford when he spotted Trayvon, a 17-year-old black youth, walking back from a convenience store where he had bought Skittles. Zimmerman reported this &quot;suspicious&quot; sighting to the Sanford Police Department on the non-emergency number, where the dispatcher told him not to get out of his car or follow the suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five minutes later, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was dead. Zimmerman immediately admitted he had shot the teen, saying that Trayvon had attacked him and he fired in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman ultimately faced charges of murder and manslaughter, but the jury found reasonable doubt and acquitted him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no reasonable doubt, though, that by carrying a gun that night, by following the unarmed youth, by disregarding the dispatcher's clear direction to stay in his vehicle, George Zimmerman brought about the death of a young person who, until they crossed paths, was simply walking along a street and minding his own business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a world of difference between being found not guilty and being innocent. George Zimmerman will have to live with that difference for the rest of his life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working together as a group called &quot;Idle No More,&quot; there were local labor activists, members of the Colorado Progressive Coalition, AIM and others at the rally. They carried signs calling for justice and declaring Zimmerman guilty of killing black teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today we're focusing on the Zimmerman verdict and joining with groups across the nation who are outraged,&quot; said Rita Martinez. &quot;A (federal) civil rights charge has to be brought against Zimmerman. No one thought he would be completely acquitted in what was a clear case of racial profiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arellano said the aftershocks of the Zimmerman case is an opportunity for Pueblo residents to push for changes in local policing. Along with Martinez and others at the rally, she told City Council last week the community needs a citizen review board to investigate complaints of police misconduct and abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She ticked off several recent cases in the community where she called the police response inadequate, including cases of sexual assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an ongoing issue in our community and it has to change,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Regarding &quot;Zimmerman acquittal; Verdict stirs North Jersey,&quot; (Page  A-1, July 15):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    With the jury's decision in the George Zimmerman case, justice and  order came to an end in America. Now any man with a gun can claim  the protection of the law without the inconvenience of adhering to  it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    When Zimmerman brushed off the lawful command to leave his concerns  to the authorities, and instead stalked his prey with deadly  intent, somehow, according to this jury, it was the unknowing prey  that lost the protection of the law and not the grim predator.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The gun, not the cross or the Constitution, has become the symbol  of righteousness in America.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Ron Greenberg  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Glen Rock, July 15  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Regarding &quot;Zimmerman acquittal; Verdict stirs North Jersey&quot; (Page  A-1, July 15):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    No matter if you agree or disagree with the George Zimmerman  verdict, there can be no disagreement over the reason why Trayvon  Martin is dead. Zimmerman had a gun that night, and the state of  Florida allowed him to carry it virtually anywhere despite a  violent history.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Stand Your Ground law, also known as &quot;Shoot First,&quot; has created  a slippery slope where you can literally stalk someone, start a  fight, and, if you are losing that fight, pull out a gun and shoot  that person and get away with it. Stand Your Ground says you have  no duty to retreat and that you can use lethal force if you  perceive or imagine there to be a threat.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Zimmerman was emboldened to get out of that car and confront Martin  because he had a concealed handgun and he knew how the law worked.  We know states that have such laws have had increases in homicide  rates, so why does the National Rifle Association keep promoting  them?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Whatever the reason, more needs to be done to end senseless gun  violence in this country. Just since the Newtown, Conn., massacre  last December, at least 119 children and 308 teenagers have been  shot and killed in the United States.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    This case was about more than just racial injustice or the politics  of gun violence. It was about a kid who was just trying to get  home. The death of Martin was a tragedy for all of us. Ask  yourself: Are you doing all that you can to prevent gun violence?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    You can start by encouraging Governor Christie to sign the  gun-violence prevention bills the Legislature has passed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Regarding &quot;Paramus C. on the clock&quot; (Page S-1, July 15):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    As if seeing the &quot;Back to School&quot; advertisement in the middle of a  flier at the beginning of the summer weren't enough to remind me  how much today's kids are robbed of their youth, then certainly the  article on Paramus Catholic's high school football team putting in  full-pad practices in 90-plus-degree July heat was more than enough  to confirm what I already know: I'm really very happy to have  played high school football in another era.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    That era was when pride still mattered. Running my own personal  wind sprints in July after some weightlifting at a friend's garage,  not at school with a personal trainer, was a joy since we did it  because we wanted to, not because we had to.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Knowing that August meant &quot;captain's practice,&quot; which is when we  came together as a group and began to forge that common goal of  working as a team, we looked forward to Sept. 1, when serious  two-a-day workouts with the coaches began.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    We were striving for unbeaten seasons and team championships as the  players still do today. However, we got to enjoy the full benefits  of summer as teenagers, not as just football players. I wish all  these athletes well as they work towards the same goals I did 40  years ago. I just wish today's high school players understood how  much they are being asked to sacrifice. You only get one shot at  being a teenager.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Keep LG tower away from the Palisades  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The New York-New Jersey Palisades is a unique area visually and  geologically. Years ago it was threatened by rock quarrying of the  front face in a number of areas.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Rockefellers and others saved this visual beauty at  considerable expense by buying out the quarries and other lands and  creating the Palisades Interstate Park. While crossing westward on  the George Washington Bridge, I have often enjoyed this wonderful  vista, especially when compared with views south of the bridge.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Now LG Electronics USA wants to construct a building in Englewood  Cliffs with a tower that stands well above the surrounding area and  that will mar this beautiful site. This should not be permitted; it  will be the first step in making the Palisades north of the bridge  look identical to that of Fort Lee south of the bridge.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Why does LG need a tower? There is sufficient area to construct the  building where proposed in a manner that blends with the present  surroundings by eliminating the tower. If LG needs a tower so much,  it can build its proposed building at another location. Let us keep  our great and unique vista.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The borough of Englewood Cliffs should do some soul searching as  well. It used very poor judgment in approving zoning changes for  this proposal.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    *  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    With the abundance of empty office space in Bergen County, cannot  LG Electronics USA consider building where they would be more  welcome? Certainly we have learned that corporate egos needing  personal satisfaction are short-term and do not last forever.  Millions of years were necessary in creating the awe and  inspiration of the Palisades.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Will LG be serving history by compromising a landmark, over which  our American eagle proudly soars once again?  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Poor hospice care is very troubling  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Regarding &quot;Hospice care is not always the best&quot; (Your Views, July  12):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    I also understand how hospice care can fail a person.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    My mother was diagnosed with a 12-pound tumor that had attached  itself to her stomach, liver and colon. She was then diagnosed with  cancer and operated on within a three-week period. The operation  was not a success, the cancer metastasized, and she died in 2010.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    She spent her last few days in one local facility where she was so  miserable she begged my father to rescue her. No one was taking  care of her; her roommate moaned and wailed incessantly. My father  brought her home, but she took a turn for the worse and promptly  returned to the hospital.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Her second hospice stay was for palliative care. The day before she  went in, she was sitting up with grace and lucidity. The day after,  she was writhing in agony and unconscious. She died within four  days.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The morning she died, we made the heart-wrenching trip to collect  her belongings. Nobody greeted us. We wandered the halls  unescorted. Her bed had been stripped, and her few possessions had  been stuffed in a garbage bag and dumped on it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    No one bid us goodbye, either. However, before my mother had been  dead for three days, my father had already received several bills  and calls demanding payment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    I'm sure there are people who make others' lives bearable before  they die, people who make sure that there are blankets, sips of  water, warm hands and soft words. I'm just not sure where those  people are.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yelling and speaking through bullhorns Monday evening while blocking traffic in downtown Stockton, about 50 men, women and children protested the not-guilty verdict delivered Saturday in the nationally watched trial charging George Zimmerman with the murder of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters, many of them crime victims themselves or family members of people killed by law enforcement, want Stockton's voice to be added to the growing cry for a different outcome. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrying a sign that read, &quot;Who do you call when cops murder?&quot; Dionne Smith Downs, the mother of James Earl Rivera Jr. -- a 16-year-old boy who was shot to death by police while evading capture in July 2010 -- helped organize Monday's protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peaceful demonstrators started in front of Stockton City Hall about 5:30 p.m. and moved out to one of the city's busiest thoroughfares, El Dorado Street, periodically standing for three to four minutes in the crosswalk that connects De Carli Waterfront Plaza with the City Centre Cinemas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are here to challenge our justice system. Trayvon was murdered. He had a right to go to the store. African-Americans are being profiled. Who speaks for us?&quot; asked Smith Downs, who is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to come together. We have hardworking people here that have to commute out of town to support their families. Who's watching their children? We want to stop black-on-black crime,&quot; she said, listing a number of issues Stockton's poor and working class must deal with on a daily basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are families here trying to educate Stockton. I want the world to hear that these small towns have a voice. Don't exclude us from the conversation. The only time they put the world spotlight on us is when we declared bankruptcy,&quot; Smith Downs said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven-year-old Isaiah Andrews, wearing a sign on the back of his sweatshirt that read, &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; said he was participating in his first protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When somebody tries to attack you and it's not right, you fight back. I think this is good for Trayvon, because he was murdered,&quot; Isaiah said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motorist Arron Williamson of Stockton, whose car was stopped by the protesters blocking the street, was at first surprised by people yelling around him and car horns honking in support before he realized what was going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I disagree with the verdict. I believe in justice from God. It's not justice for my kids,&quot; Williamson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a 30-minute period, the majority of blocked motorists appeared to support the protesters. Despite acts of civil disobedience, there was no visible police presence at the scene during the early evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our department balances public safety with the right to assemble and freedom of speech and, as time permitted, officers went by and monitored the lawful gathering and reminded the group that they needed to obey all laws and not go into the street,&quot; police spokesman Officer Joe Silva said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A candlelight vigil to remember Martin and other victims was expected to follow the protest later in the evening.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Feb. 26, 2012, George Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon Martin. This much is certain. The competing and contentious reactions to the incident and its aftermath have played out according to form. Saturday's acquittal of Zimmerman does not salve the wounds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury concluded that Zimmerman acted in self-defense. Its verdict does not surprise. Although observations from outside the courtroom cannot equal the experience of being there, reports from the trial suggested the defense made a more compelling case. Do verdicts automatically convey truth?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the fateful night, Zimmerman notified authorities that he had seen a suspicious person. His active engagement should have ended with the call. His shadowy presence might have led Martin to fear for his safety. Zimmerman erred in taking the law into his own hands. Would this have played out as it has if Martin had been a white teen clad in a crew neck Florida Gators sweatshirt? The color line persists. Each of us is the sum of centuries, and homeward looks reveal few angels. And to say that race influences perceptions, perspectives and behavior is not to say that certain actors belong to the Klan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighborhood watches make valuable contributions. Civilian participants do not serve in police departments, however. The lesson says, &quot;Call the police but do not act in their stead.&quot; The jury might have reached an appropriate decision and jury decisions command respect, yet Zimmerman bears the moral burden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One human being is dead. Another, despite his acquittal, is destined for a life of notoriety. Individuals and nations have much to overcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as Richmonders ponder events in Florida, may they also pause to remember Jett Higham, the 18-year-old who was shot to death in Jackson Ward while walking to a store to buy a snack. The circumstances of his killing do not resemble the circumstances of Martin's killing, yet Higham's death reminds a weary community of the violence that tears the nation's heart.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our flight -- from, of all places, Florida -- had just taxied to the gate at Richmond International Airport when my obligatory check of the cellphone announced the George Zimmerman trial verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social media outrage amassed within minutes, followed by petitions to boycott Florida tourism until it repealed a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law that transforms self-defense into something that seems a lot like shoot-first paranoia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were dismayed but hardly surprised. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was clear from the bits of trial coverage we consumed during our vacation that the prosecution of Zimmerman was not going well. The deceased seemed to be more on trial than the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin and Zimmerman, in the eyes of their defenders and detractors, had become more symbolic than real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old with no criminal record, became the posthumous stand-in for black predators real and imagined. Zimmerman, the 29-year-old neighborhood watch coordinator, became the embodiment of law and order, despite past brushes with the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury was composed of six women -- five white, one vaguely described as multiethnic. The judge, prosecutors and defense attorneys were white. The prosecution appeared out of its depth when not hamstrung by inarticulate witnesses and a set of Florida self-defense laws weighted in the defendant's favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's rainy-night attire, a hoodie, became the proverbial ski mask. A teen of unimposing stature -- 5-foot-11, 158 pounds, according to his autopsy -- was inflated into a fearless aggressor who uttered lines last heard in Hollywood. (&quot;You're going to die tonight&quot; before the shooting and &quot;You got me&quot; afterward.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less plausible, apparently, was the notion of a kid truly frightened by his pursuit by a stranger who turned out to be armed and dangerous. One of the most revealing bits of testimony -- Martin describing Zimmerman as a &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot; -- was parsed for its racist intent instead of its more significant meaning: creepy -- &quot;causing fear or unease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You keep hoping and praying for change, and it comes in fits and starts. But each generation comes with its hard truth that progress is incremental, struggle is perpetual and old habits die hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My nephew and his cousin were profiled in the mid-1990s, while attending a dance at Lloyd C. Bird High School in Chesterfield County. They came at the invitation of my nephew's then-girlfriend, a Bird student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boys, Richmond residents and students at Benedictine High, were grilled by a faculty member. What school do you boys go to? Can you name some of your teachers? What school would you attend if you didn't attend Benedictine? Duly assessed as inner-city threats, they were told that a condition of their admission would be their submission to a pat-down search by a Chesterfield police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such indignities drive home why Martin's death and Zimmerman's acquittal resonated so powerfully among the parents of young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman should have stopped following Martin when so instructed by the dispatcher. But somehow, the case became less about the tragic result of his heedless pursuit than about who was on top shortly before he pulled the trigger of his 9 mm handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver Hill Jr., son of the iconic civil rights lawyer, was asked what his father would say about the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he would have been upset about it, and I think he would be encouraging further scrutiny of some of these kinds of laws,&quot; said Hill, a psychology professor at Virginia State University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob Corcoran, national director of the Richmond-based Initiatives of Change USA, lamented that the Zimmerman verdict is &quot;clearly going to feed the widely held assumptions that some people's lives are less valid than others -- that somehow, a person of color's life is of less value.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He'd like to see an honest conversation on the issues surrounding the case. Front and center in such a dialogue should be the heartbreaking vulnerability of young African-American men, a sad reality punctuated by the recent slaying in Jackson Ward of a promising 18-year-old, Jett Higham, who -- not unlike Martin -- was slain in his quest for candy and a drink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Higham's alleged assailants were promptly arrested. Sanford police did not initially arrest Zimmerman because of Florida's stand-your-ground laws. The wheels of justice would never have turned without the national outcry that led to Zimmerman's arrest a month and a half after he killed Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a foreshadowing of the bizarre nature of Florida justice, a Jacksonville woman -- stand-your-ground defense notwithstanding -- was sentenced to 20 years in prison Friday for firing a warning shot in an effort to scare off her abusive husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another case,a stand-your-ground law aided and abetted misogyny, facilitating a Texas man's acquittal in the slaying case of a prostitute who refused to have sex with him or return his money. The man's lawyer said the shooting was authorized under a Texas law permitting deadly force to &quot;retrieve stolen property at night,&quot; according to the San Antonio Express-News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hopefully out of this we can have some more mature discussions of all these issues,&quot; Hill said. &quot;We tend to talk about this in the context of sensationalized trials where everyone's emotions are heightened and everyone feels like the aggrieved party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when, exactly, do we get there?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too often, we seem less like a nation than two parallel universes with inverse realities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to be optimistic about the prospects of a dead black teen being a catalyst for change when a classroom of slaughtered 6-year-olds in Newtown, Conn., failed to move the needle. But inaction is not an option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At some point, the cliche that 'guns don't kill people, people do' is going to fall apart,&quot; said Renee Hill, Oliver's wife and an associate professor of philosophy at VSU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we're going to come to a tipping point. I just hope that there aren't too many bodies on the ground before we get there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've got to resist the racial stereotyping stubbornly ingrained in our national DNA, topple the hegemony of the gun in American life, and dismantle the insidious laws that blur the line between predator and prey.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mood during the morning worship service at Calvary Baptist Church in Salt Lake City was hopeful and lively as Pastor France Davis preached about the Lord's goodness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin's name surfaced a few times in prayers for the murdered Florida teen's family. But no rage or call to action arose in this predominantly African American congregation in response to the not guilty verdict handed down to neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman the night before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're sadly disappointed, and we think that justice has not been served in this case,&quot; Pastor France Davis said after. &quot;An unarmed young man's life has been taken, and there's a family that misses him and is tragically affected by that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis, 67, participated in the tumultuous civil rights movement in the 1960s and was one of hundreds who marched from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., seeking equal voting rights. Blood was spilled and lives were lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm concerned that we haven't made any more progress in our society than this,&quot; Davis said. &quot;I would have thought that we would have stopped profiling and stereotyping and move forward -- but it seems we are still there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the freshly freed Zimmerman, Davis believes his first agenda item should be &quot;to go to that Martin family and offer his condolences and apology for taking the life of their son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he respected that the court had spoken, Calvary Baptist Associate Minister Anthony Bennett, who is black, worries that unless Americans bind together, racial struggles could eventually &quot;bring us down as a nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These issues of race, these miscarriages of justice, we can only go so far until they don't work for us anymore,&quot; Bennett said. &quot;They won't serve us well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa Novak, who leads the congregation at Ogden's Unitarian Universalist Church and is white, said Saturday's verdict came as no surprise, &quot;but I was horrified nonetheless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It says something about our culture,&quot; Novak said, &quot;and not good things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three shared concerns about Utah's Stand Your Ground law, which is similar to Florida's statute that allows individuals to meet force with force if they believe that their own or someone else's life is in danger. It took weeks of public outcry for police to arrest Zimmerman because of that law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what a black mother is going to tell her kid now -- don't go out, and if someone follows you, don't fight back?&quot; Novak said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People have been hopeful for more justice, equality and fairness in the world,&quot; Novak added.&quot;Then stuff like this happens and you know that things haven't changed that much -- which means we have to work harder.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- Already reeling from two nights of vandalism and violence, Oakland was mopping up Tuesday morning after a third night of protests downtown that left more smashed windows and storefronts, graffiti and scattered debris from demonstrators' clashes with police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd of several hundred were protesting Saturday's acquittal of George Zimmerman in Florida and briefly shut down traffic on Interstate 880 and blocked several streets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the protesters' marches and skirmishes with police downtown, more than a dozen businesses were vandalized, including some targeted during previous protests. City cleanup crews started at 6 a.m. &quot;to get a head start&quot; on the garbage and other debris, one worker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those targeted for the first time were Comerica Bank, 1200 Broadway, the Burger King restaurant at 13th and Broadway, Youth Radio, 1701 Broadway, and Men's Wearhouse, 300 Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. All had windows smashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those vandalized previously that were damaged again Monday night and early Tuesday included Sears Roebuck and Co., 1950 Broadway, which had additional windows smashed and paint splattered, and the restaurant Flora, 1900 Telegraph Ave., where a waiter was savagely attacked and windows were broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already boarded-up windows on some businesses became easels for graffiti, including the Oakland Tribune offices at 1900 Broadway, T-Mobile at 13th and Broadway, Foot Locker in the 1400 block of Broadway and the California Bank and Trust at 19th and Franklin streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business owners and others were concerned over the damage and were worried about when it would end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Golshami, manager of El Senor Burrito 3 at 430 13th St., said he was glad that no damage was done to his business, which had boarded up its windows in advance. He said he plans to keep them boarded up &quot;for the next few days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A security guard working his first day at the MASH building, 428 13th St., said he had not been told how long he would be there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ratha Kuch, 41, owner of the Buongiorno restaurant on Broadway, which just recently opened, felt fortunate that none of his windows were broken and had no plans to board them up. &quot;I'm frustrated and I hope this ends soon,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the night's protests, a restaurant worker at Flora in Oakland's Uptown area was injured when he was hit by a masked, hammer-wielding attacker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another injury was reported by witnesses who said a protester was injured and writhing in pain at Broadway and 16th Street after apparently being struck in the shoulder by a police projectile. Police are still investigating whether anyone was hit by an object, whether it came from police or from the crowd. Police have not been able to locate the person who was injured. At one point, a squad of officers making arrests of vandalism suspects was surrounded by protesters throwing rocks and bottles and they responded by firing one tear-gas round, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nine arrests made by police Tuesday night included suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, resisting arrest, vandalism and similar offenses. One replica firearm (BB gun) was recovered from a protester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland developer Phil Tagami said he watched vandals deface one of his own buildings last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oakland is a very progressive town and we're very understanding of different points of view and we'll continue to defend people's rights to peacefully assemble and protest. That's part of the DNA of Oakland,&quot; he said. &quot;What we don't appreciate is the lawlessness and the anarchy and the physical violence as well as the property damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw the crowd out there last night. When people are smashing out the windows of Youth Radio that's clearly someone who isn't from Oakland or even about what the issue is. They're anarchists. These are local businesses with local owners with local employees. These are not chained businesses. I don't get it. That's the disconnect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tagami, who in 2011 provided a one-man sentry for the Rotunda Building in Frank H. Ogawa Plaza that he oversaw a $50 million renovation on in years past, called for a zero-tolerance policy regarding the vandalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're doing that you're going to jail. If you're hitting someone with a hammer you're going to jail,&quot; he said. &quot;That person has to be found and held to account.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, remained in hiding on Tuesday after a jury of six anonymous women on Saturday found him not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter, ending a Florida state prosecution of a case that has captivated and polarized the U.S. public on issues of race, gun and self-defense laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former employee at the Florida State Attorney office is preparing a whistleblower lawsuit against Zimmerman's prosecutors after testifying that they failed to turn over evidence he obtained from Martin's cell phone to the defense, his attorney told Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting in the central Florida town of Sanford on February 26, 2012, prompted street demonstrations last year when police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman, and the verdict provoked renewed marches from critics saying Zimmerman racially profiled Martin as a criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's defense team have complained repeatedly that race was wrongly injected into the case and that Zimmerman acted in self-defense, accusing civil rights leaders of inflaming racial passions with their calls for a federal investigation of Zimmerman on civil rights grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In California, police and civic leaders braced for further unrest while appealing for calm on Tuesday after nearly two dozen protesters in Los Angeles and Oakland were arrested during a second night of civil disturbances sparked by the not-guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the six jurors, identified only as juror number B-37, told CNN on Monday she did not think Zimmerman racially profiled Martin and believed Martin attacked Zimmerman first. The entire panel - five white women and one Hispanic woman - believed race played no role in the case, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B-37's interview with CNN, her faced blacked out in silhouette, prompted extreme reactions including death threats on social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder, the chief U.S. prosecutor and an appointee of President Barack Obama, told the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Orlando on Tuesday that his office would continue its investigation of the case, which could possibly lead to federal charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I,&quot; he said emphatically, &quot;am concerned about this case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder called for a review of self-defense laws like the one in Florida that appeared to play a role in his acquittal. According to the jury's instructions, Zimmerman had &quot;no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force&quot; if he reasonably feared for his life or great bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder, who is black, also related personal stories about being racially profiled as a young adult and stopped by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon's death last spring caused me to sit down and have a conversation with my own 15-year-old son, like my dad did with me,&quot; Holder said. &quot;This was a father-son tradition I hoped would not need to be handed down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MORE PROTESTS PLANNED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader Al Sharpton called a &quot;Justice for Trayvon Day,&quot; planning a further 100 demonstrations in 100 cities on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People from all over the country will gather to show that we are not having a two- or three-day anger fit. This is a social movement for justice,&quot; Sharpton told reporters in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lead defense lawyer Mark O'Mara on Monday called the prosecution team a disgrace to the legal profession for holding back evidence that should have been promptly shared with the defense team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Kruidbos, a former director of information technology at State Attorney Angela Corey's Tallahassee-area prosecutor's office, is preparing a whistleblower lawsuit against the prosecutors after testifying that they failed to turn over evidence he obtained from Martin's cellphone while still employed by Corey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will be filing a whistleblower action in (Florida's Fourth Judicial District) Circuit Court,&quot; said Kruidbos' attorney Wesley White, himself a former prosecutor who was hired by Corey but resigned in December because he disagreed with her prosecutorial priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Corey nor lead prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda immediately responded to requests for comment on White's charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Corey referred Reuters to Kruidbos' termination letter, previously made public, in which Corey's office accused him of hacking confidential information from state computers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kruidbos testified last month in a pretrial hearing that he found embarrassing photos on Martin's phone that included pictures of a clump of jewelry on a bed, underage nude females, marijuana plants and a hand holding a semiautomatic pistol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us give the jury the benefit of the doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us assume that, within the narrow constraints of the evidence at hand and Florida's bizarre gun laws, six good women rendered the only verdict they could Saturday night in acquitting George Zimmerman of murder and manslaughter in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Even so, the problem remains. Whatever legal closure it gives, this verdict does not satisfy, any more than a guilty verdict would have, the central moral question here:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why did Zimmerman regard Trayvon as suspicious when all he did was wear a hooded sweatshirt while walking in the rain? Why did initial police reports designate Trayvon the suspect when he was actually the unarmed victim? Why was his assailant able to go home that same night?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents have consistently rejected any notion that race played a role in his death. It was a smart position, reflecting a recognition that when race enters the conversation, reason often exits, compassion following close behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But truth is, race has been there at every turn. If man and boy had both been black or white, we would never have heard of either. There likely would not even have been a shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many of us as African-Americans, that night was a recurring nightmare driven to a horrific conclusion. It was the driving-while-black traffic stops, the &quot;born suspect&quot; joke that isn't, the cost of being black in a nation that considers black the natural color of criminality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people -- most of them white and on the furthest right of the political spectrum -- will disagree. For them, Zimmerman is the victim here, a man who acted justifiably to defend himself. Race, they will say, did not enter the picture except afterward, when he was thrown to the mob because of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And you wonder: What color is the sky on their world?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years ago, &quot;What Would You Do?&quot; an ABC-TV hidden-camera show, set up a situation where two actors posed as bike thieves in a public park, using bolt cutters and hacksaws to cut a bike chain. The results were instructive. Over the course of an hour, a hundred people passed the white &quot;thief&quot; by with barely a glance. The black one had hardly gotten to work before a crowd of whites gathered around him, interrogating him, lecturing him, calling 911, even shooting cellphone video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did race explain the disparity? &quot;Not at all,&quot; a white man who had harassed the black actor assured the cameras. &quot;He could've been any color, it wouldn't have mattered to me.&quot; He doubtless believed what he said. For some of us, though, it has a tired, heard-before quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, after all, the kind of thing some people always say when you complain of voter ID laws that will peel black voters off the rolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or when you condemn Republican presidential candidates for using &quot;welfare&quot; as a dog-whistle word of racial acrimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or when an unarmed boy is killed and the man who did the killing doesn't even spend the night in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the answer to the moral questions that killing raises is not mysterious to some of us. We know how America is. We know, for instance, that it regards black men as inherently criminal, jails them disproportionately because of that belief, then points to the fact that they are disproportionately jailed as proof of that belief. We know, in other words, that where people who look like Trayvon are concerned, America is a little nuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we know what stalked Trayvon down that street last year. We know what killed him. And we know why the people who were paid to give a damn about that, didn't. You see, we have not the luxury of self-delusion. We have sons and grandsons and nephews, and we must teach them, too, how America is. They are cocky and invincible in the way boys always are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they all look like Trayvon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some $71,000 a year to be a &quot;station agent&quot; who does not sell tickets and does not handle any money? How much training do you need for this? Why do you deserve more money?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am an angry BART rider. I'm sure I am not that much different from many other riders. I have not had a raise in more than 10 years. I do not have a pension. I pay my own medical. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have a college degree and make less than a train operator or a station agent -- and I am grateful to have a job. BART employees do not deserve a 15 or 20 percent pay increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BART unions' demands are absurd. It is inexcusable to hold the public hostage to unreasonable demands. This is a great example of a public employees union out of reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART should be hiring and training replacement workers as quickly as possible and lawmakers should be supporting the public they supposedly serve, not the deep-pocket labor union campaign contributors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plastic recycling is putting that small percent of plastic into machinery that grinds it, adding unregulated chemicals -- regulation reduces profit -- to make it malleable, then constructing it into couches, textiles, shoes, and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plastic lasts longer than nuclear waste. It will bury us. Please understand we are lied to by our &quot;owners&quot; so they can make profit off us. We're constantly in the position of finding how best to accommodate the lives we're forced to lead, constrained by &quot;their&quot; profit, instead of enrichment of our lives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why not protest the murders here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As shocking as George Zimmerman's acquittal may seem to most of us, let's keep in mind that there are so many murder victims whose killers slip through the cracks of the justice system or are simply never brought to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find it more shocking that Oakland residents would protest Zimmerman's acquittal when the city of Oakland itself has had more than 50 homicides in just this year alone and includes a former student of mine, Aya Nakano, who was murdered in a senseless manner last month and whose killers have yet to be found. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that the national media has an odd way of selecting stories to cover and Oakland residents will wreak havoc on their own city based on anything they feel has racial implications even if it happened 3,000 miles away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think about murder victims in your own city and let's be more sensible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thugs come out again in Oakland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find it extremely disconcerting that when racially charged events occur, either locally or nationally, that thugs come out in Oakland and show blatant disregard for property and the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday evening's events in downtown Oakland were reminiscent of those several years ago after the Oscar Grant verdict and the civil disobedience that ensued. Do these perpetrators understand that they are damaging the property of innocent people and their actions serve no good purpose?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What may be worse in the midst of all this destruction is that the Oakland police made no arrests. It is almost as if the police condoned the actions of an angry mob. The mayor and other city officials need to enforce the rule of law and encourage peaceful protests or Oakland will always have a negative national reputation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who are the white radicals in masks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My impression was that conscious human beings, whether black or white, reacted naturally to the George Zimmerman verdict Saturday with shock and numbness, and by Sunday we experienced a personal meditative reverence inspired by and honoring the behavior of the noble and nonviolent Trayvon&nbsp;Martin family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A loud outcry is understandable, and yet must be a feeble echo of what speaks most loudly, on a worldwide scale -- the unjust murder of Martin calling attention to the unjust fate of so many thousands more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so who are these white radicals in masks, with no love for our town, and no knowledge of our urgent causes or feelings, who come to use Oakland as an experimental laboratory where they may act out their adolescent ignorance, undoubtedly in loud denial of their own unexamined participation in American violence?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was the one who was on trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The George Zimmerman &quot;trial&quot; was a complete sham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was never really on trial: Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clyde E. Albert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hayward</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verdict in the Martin case was shameful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case is a disgrace. There have been times I've been really proud of our country, such as the recent Supreme Court decisions on the Defense of Marriage Act and Proposition 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this made me feel that we have not made an inch of progress on racial equality, and I am profoundly sad to live in a country where such things are possible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone knows that the state of Texas has a 19th-century outlook on human executions. Last week we discovered, despite Wendy Davis' valiant efforts, that Texas stubbornly clings to a 19th-century outlook toward women's health. Now Craig Carpenter (Letters, July 15) suggests California emulate Texas' 19th-century &quot;drill, baby, drill&quot; fossil fuel energy policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luckily for us, progressive California lives in the 21st century and we'll leave our big hats and Confederate flags in the history books and focus on clean, future-oriented energy technologies, thanks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is exactly what I was afraid of after Zimmerman verdict: Every misguided vigilante like Randall Fullner (Letters, July 16) now thinks it is their right to hunt down any shady character loitering in their neighborhood.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randall Fullner (Letters, July 16) writes that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's actions were suspicious, and George Zimmerman had the right to protect his life. By suspicious I guess he means being a black teen walking through a white neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We live in a gated, mostly white Los Gatos community. My kids are half Filipino, so they have darker skin, and occasionally wear sweatshirts with hoodies when it's cold. Their friends who come to visit are of many different races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If everyone here practiced what Zimmerman did and Fullner advocates, we would have our neighbors shooting at them just for being what they are -- nonwhites in a white neighborhood.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police, city government, and judicial system in Florida gave George Zimmerman a &quot;fair and legal&quot; trial. If you want to change the culture that approves hunting down and killing unarmed black youths, take a lesson from South Africa. There an effective boycott changed long-term apartheid policies and led to a freer society. Visitors seeking entertainment should avoid Florida. Snowbirds and vacationers, seek sun and sandy beaches elsewhere. If you are appalled at the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, march and cry, &quot;Boycott, Boycott, Boycott.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many innocent South Africans were hurt by the worldwide boycott organized to bring down its former, racist government. A Florida boycott can work to avoid another such pitiful event in our country. Pray and march.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wayne Gulledge didn't join a protest or vigil this week. But like so many African-American men, Gulledge views the acquittal of a Florida neighborhood watch volunteer for killing an unarmed black teenager through the prism of injustices experienced in his own life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is left with this unsettling thought: Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At one point, every black male -- whether you're from the hood, whether you're from the middle class -- has been profiled,&quot; said Gulledge, 33, of San Leandro. &quot;It's just the way it is. It's sad, but you have to expect it, no matter what you do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of George Zimmerman continues to reverberate around the country, and nowhere has the conversation and outrage been louder than in the Bay Area. Nearly 3,000 miles away from the trial in Sanford, Fla., the symbolism of the case has far overshadowed the courtroom proceedings that resulted in a not-guilty verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reaction is not just playing out in the streets of downtown Oakland, where peaceful daylight protests have descended into nighttime chaos and vandalism. Across the region, people continue to wrestle with the stark reality that a 17-year-old African-American who was walking home from a store is dead, and they see no one being held accountable for his lost life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are just so very hurt,&quot; said Pastor Oscar Dace, whose Bible Way Christian Center held a town hall Tuesday night so San Jose congregation members could vent. &quot;It feels like in our country, where there is supposed to be justice for all, there's really only justice for some. This is just another example of a black life not being valued like a white life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For youths angered by the verdicts, several Oakland community centers, art studios and churches have opened their doors. On the Cal State East Bay campus in Hayward, the school's diversity center has a forum planned for Thursday so students and faculty can sort through their feelings about a trial that has provoked such disparate perspectives, many of them falling on racial, generational or ideological lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is one of those stories like the O.J. Simpson trial, where everybody was paying attention,&quot; said Jonathan Stoll, the diversity center manager. &quot;Maybe people were surprised at the verdict, but when they began to look at the larger picture, they realized that it fits a pattern that leaves us with a feeling of hopelessness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, a Florida jury found Zimmerman, 29, not guilty on murder charges in the Feb. 26, 2012, shooting death of Martin, who was returning home from a convenience store where he had bought candy and an ice tea drink. Defense attorneys argued Martin provoked the attack, inciting Zimmerman, the only surviving eyewitness, to shoot him in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unnamed juror who was a member of the six-woman panel told CNN that &quot;all of us thought race did not play a role&quot; in the case. But that statement has been met with the same kind of widespread disbelief among African-Americans and many others as the verdict itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watching the news Saturday was Andre V. Chapman, founder and CEO of the Unity Care Group, a San Jose-based nonprofit that helps guide foster youth into adulthood. With him were his 18-year-old son and five friends, who quickly took to Twitter to comment on the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a rainbow coalition of kids of all ethnicities, and they were all asking, 'How is this even possible?'&quot; said Chapman, a father of three. &quot;These kids watch this and then draw the parallels in their own lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict only reinforces societal perceptions that do little to help how Americans view each other, said Margalynne Armstrong, a Santa Clara University associate professor of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, she said, there is the idea that there are places where you're not supposed to be if you're an African-American. Another is that young black males must carefully &quot;toe the line&quot; in how they dress and act, or they risk being viewed as a threat by others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can't walk with their hood up or be aggressive in any way,&quot; added Armstrong, who teaches a course on race and the law. &quot;Well, that's a heavy burden to carry that other teenagers don't have to deal with just because they're not African-American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The specter of urban violence and &quot;all these images of black-on-black crime&quot; in the media only feed into stereotypes, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's complicated,&quot; Armstrong added. &quot;Those often are in neighborhoods of low income, low services and low opportunity. People move from those places for a better life for their families. But clearly they aren't always moving to places safer for young black males.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrations have been particularly tense in Oakland, where Oscar Grant was shot and killed by a BART officer in 2009. While many protesters are young white activists with no firsthand experience at the brunt of racism, for others, the experience was more personal. One 16-year-old black teen, wearing a symbolic white hoodie such as the one Martin was pictured wearing, told the crowd Tuesday night near Oakland's Lake Merritt he had to sneak out of his house to join the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My mama is fearful for my life because I'm out here at night,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend -- only adding to the resonance -- marked the national premiere of &quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; the film that recounts the final day in Grant's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was at the cinema that Gulledge found a place to reflect, joining crowds that lined up Monday at Oakland's Grand Lake Theater even as protesters were beginning to gather downtown for the third consecutive night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What bothered Gulledge most about the shooting trials of Zimmerman and the BART officer, Johannes Mehserle, was how the character of each victim was tarnished in order to justify why they were shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was more like Trayvon was on trial,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growing up in a middle-class family, Gulledge remembers how he and his dad were pulled over after a soccer game just for driving through the affluent Oakland hills, and that the profiling continued when he moved to Danville in his 20s. He even went to the town's police station to announce his presence, saying, &quot;Hey, this is who I am, I'm a black man living in this neighborhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dace's congregation in San Jose is about half African-American. And when kids had a discussion Sunday of their feelings about the Martin case, there was emotion and some fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are good kids here,&quot; Dace said. &quot;Some wear baggy jeans and hoodies. But they are our children. They are loved. And it's hurtful that other people don't see them that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- With police facing intensifying criticism from city leaders for again failing to prevent a small number of agitators from vandalizing downtown businesses during the tail end of mass protests, Chief Sean Whent gave no assurances Tuesday that he would get tougher on vandals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our focus in all these things is about safety of people over property,&quot; Whent said on KQED's Forum program. &quot;That includes the safety of citizens and police officers.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To illustrate the risks faced by police, Whent said that officers who raced across Broadway late last night to arrest vandals smashing windows at a Men's Warehouse were attacked by the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why we ended up deploying gas to basically rescue the officers out of there,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whent's comments contrasted sharply with those of Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck, whose force also has faced off with violent protesters following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beck warned the agitators Tuesday that &quot;if you come here again tonight, you will go to jail,&quot; the L.A. Times reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Jean Quan told KQED that police must do better but that the vandals are a slippery foe for an understaffed police department. &quot;It's a fine line to honor the tradition of protest in the city and on the other hand to get enough resources out to do the violence prevention,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's protests in Oakland were the largest and most violent since Saturday's jury verdict in a case that has sparked a national debate about racial profiling. Hundreds of protesters briefly took over a section of Interstate 880 early in the evening. Shortly after 11 p.m. a much smaller group of masked vandals began smashing windows downtown. One waiter at a downtown restaurant was hit in the face while trying to stop a hammer-wielding vandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I was a retailer thinking about coming to downtown Oakland, I wouldn't do it given what's transpired the last few nights,&quot; Councilman Larry Reid said. &quot;My business couldn't be protected, and my employees couldn't be protected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reid and other city leaders fear that after years of being accused of acting too aggressively against protesters -- and paying out tens of millions of dollars in police misconduct lawsuits -- officers now are showing too much restraint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department currently is under federal supervision after failing to satisfy court-mandated reforms. The court-appointed federal overseer, former Baltimore Police Commissioner Thomas Frazier, had previously excoriated the department's handling of the 2011 Occupy Oakland protests that resulted in 44 officers facing disciplinary charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Councilman Ignacio De La Fuente said police are being reigned in by outside powers calling the shots. &quot;The result is that they're not doing what they are supposed to do when they see people committing a crime or violating the law,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frazier could not be reached for comment Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whent said he didn't think the fallout from the Occupy protests or recent million-dollar settlements awarded to protesters had made officers shy away from conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it's in the back of their minds, that could be a possibility, but I don't think that is the case,&quot; he said during an afternoon news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whent said that police were caught off-guard by the size and intensity of Monday's protest. After hundreds of demonstrators marched onto the freeway, police reassigned officers from elsewhere in the city and received additional help from nine outside police agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With their numbers augmented, police were able to flank protesters, which put them in a better position to target troublemakers, Whent said. Police made nine arrests Monday, after making just one the previous two nights of protests. Whent said that might not seem like much but added that there were relatively few agitators interspersed among the protesters. &quot;It's very difficult to march into a crowd of several hundred people to grab a few who are breaking windows,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilman Dan Kalb wouldn't criticize police but said the only way to stop the vandals was to bring them to justice. &quot;We need to arrest people who are breaking windows and committing violent acts,&quot; he said. &quot;And we need to arrest as many of them as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: I recently declined an offer to sign a referendum petition opposing an affordable senior housing development on Maybell Avenue. This development offers Palo Alto what looks to be an appropriate and relatively low-impact use of an available property. I've studied and worked in the affordable housing arena, and it is well established that senior apartment complexes of this type generate lower parking and traffic impacts than other types of housing. Seniors at this site won't drive as much -- certainly not at peak times -- and in fact some won't own a car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financing and development of affordable housing is complicated, and appropriate properties are extraordinarily hard to come by. And because of the complexities of tax-credit applications, nonprofit developers often receive loans from cities in advance of approval, though these loan commitments do not bind the cities to approve the projects. The professionals with the stamina to successfully put the pieces together and earn the unanimous approval of a project like this from the city council should receive our support. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're skeptical that we need affordable housing for seniors in Palo Alto, consider the South Palo Alto Food Closet where I volunteer a few hours a week. Some of the folks who pick up food here are your senior neighbors and friends, and they need more options to remain living here. And they could be you some day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rancho San Antonio Park</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: Neither the Santa Clara Valley Water District nor the Committee for Green Foothills cares about wasting $7 million in taxpayer money on a proposed flood basin in Rancho San Antonio Park, one of the largest open spaces in Santa Clara County. A half-million residents enjoy Rancho annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed 15-acre Rancho flood basin will remove more than 100 trees and 200,000 cubic yards of soil. It will destroy the existing wetland basin, something that would never be permitted if proposed by the private sector. The water district cannot defend its hydrology calculations, which independent local engineers Richard Moll and Mike Hayden say are exaggerated by at least 200 percent. Both Moll and Hayden contend the proposed Rancho basin will not have any meaningful flow. Do we have a different standard for the water district, here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In planning the Rancho basin, water district engineers have ignored the U.S. Geological Survey's 1986 report, 89-4130, which warns that altering the existing Rancho basin may destroy the natural wetland meadow and drop the natural, historic water table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 25, I telephoned the Committee for Green Foothills asking for support in the form of a letter to the water district questioning its plans for a basin at Rancho San Antonio Park, then followed up with environmental impact and hydrology reports from local experts. So far, no one has responded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: I am really concerned that the Palo Alto City Council has decided to move forward with establishing a ban on people sleeping in their vehicles. Most people will not choose to live out of their cars if they have a better place to live. Besides, it does not even make economic sense. Have they considered how much time and effort will have to be directed at going after these vehicle dwellers to issue warnings, then citations? And if they do not leave, or cannot pay the fines, then even more resources will be devoted to their arrests, court proceedings and perhaps even incarceration. Most of these car dwellers are just law-abiding citizens struggling to find jobs that pay enough for real housing. Turning them into criminals will make it that much harder to find employment. This is a vicious cycle that pushes more people deeper into homelessness.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin-Zimmerman case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: Since when does the aggressor of a fight have the right to plead self-defense? George Zimmerman stalked that 17-year-old kid who had not committed any crime. Zimmerman had no right to stop him and no right to question him. He intentionally provoked a defensive reaction out of the kid and committed an assault that forfeited his right to claim self-defense; only the kid had that right then, and Zimmerman was responsible for any ensuing result. If the kid beat him to death, he had the right of self-defense. If Zimmerman killed the kid while committing a crime, he was guilty of either murder or manslaughter. It then boiled down to &quot;intent.&quot; If the jury can infer from all the facts such as Zimmerman's racial statements, his carrying a gun, his disregard of the 911 dispatch that police were on their way, and his intent to kill or commit bodily harm, then the verdict should have been first-degree murder. Juries make mistake all the time. Remember the O.J. Simpson case, the Rodney King case and resulting riots, the Oscar Grant case? These juries have to live with consequences as we all do, until we find a better system.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: It all could have been so simple. Clearly, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin correctly believed that he was profiled as a potential criminal by a neighborhood watch volunteer. All Trayvon had to do was use his cellphone to record the evidence of this act and call police to diffuse any potential violent confrontation. With that evidence and a police report in hand, he could have then submitted a formal complaint of a violation of his civil rights through the many legal firms that pursue such cases for free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had he done so, had he availed himself of the protections afforded to him by our legal system and still lost his case, only then would our black community have had the right to call our legal system racist. Given the evidence and the proceedings of a fair trial, the jury could not believe that George Zimmerman pursued Trayvon with the intention of provoking a physical confrontation with the ultimate goal of killing him. On the contrary, the jury was convinced that Trayvon chose the path of violent confrontation instead of de-escalating the situation with the means provided to him by his cellphone and our legal system.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: Many people believe race had everything to do with the verdict in George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. I have another way of looking at it, though. I believe that Mr. Zimmerman also represents the law enforcement community, being what his role was that evening, and in what took place. If this had been a case involving a white man who was not highly placed in society, but someone who was from a poor family or had a record of involvement in the criminal justice system, there would definitely have been a different outcome. Also, if Zimmerman was in any way not a part of the status quo, meaning if he was not charged with protecting the property of a wealthy condominium community and possessing a clearance to carry a gun, he would have been treated differently by the law. It is so easy in America for members of minority groups to believe that all white people are treated the same and get the same breaks, or that all white people are rich and enjoy privileged lives. One must remember people like George Zimmerman, the Los Angeles Police Department and Johannes Mehserle were all tied in with the brotherhood of law enforcement officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The larger question is not the shooting to death of a young black man like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, but why there are so many young black men like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin wasting their lives away in the prison system who don't really need to be there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In closing, there have been a lot of homeless and mentally ill people who have been brutally beaten and killed by police, as well as members of the general public, and their cases have never even been heard in court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor: I wasn't too surprised to see the not-guilty verdict in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case. I am concerned about the follow-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If peaceful protests result in a federal trial for George Zimmerman having violated Martin's civil rights by killing him, I could accept that. I do believe it violates our double jeopardy rule, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if another trial is the result of mob rule similar to the Rodney King case, I will lose whatever remaining respect I have for our criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who wanted a guilty verdict for George Zimmerman are entitled to peacefully express disappointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not really sure what there is to protest regarding that verdict, though, even for people convinced Zimmerman belongs in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesting implies jurors did wrong, as if having doubts about guilt is a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protest made sense, and achieved its aim, back when it was about the decision that Zimmerman would not be charged despite evidence that he had racially profiled and then fatally shot a teenage visitor in Sanford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after those successful protests, a murder charge was filed and it has now been prosecuted vigorously. More evidence came out, too. Some gave limited support to Zimmerman's claim that while he strongly had suspected and followed Trayvon Martin for no valid reason, he did nothing else to provoke an attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unarmed Martin, he said, suddenly charged and knocked him down and pounded his head on the pavement. I suspect Zimmerman omitted part of the sequence of events. But as that was never proven, and Zimmerman had wounds to show that his head was pounded, I find no fault with the jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I mean aside from their failure to have psychic powers that would have told them certainly and exactly what happened before Zimmerman pulled his concealed gun and fired. But many other people do have psychic powers, at least when inspired by political and racial insights, or pro- or anti-gun attitudes or the like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those people know for sure that Zimmerman really was innocent, or that he should have been convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not me. I have doubts I think are reasonable. I think we must now accept the tragic fact that none of us really knows what Zimmerman did or didn't do in the moments before he grappled with and shot that unarmed teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some anti-verdict protesters are bringing up another Florida case that is very different. I don't see it quite as they do, but I much agree it resulted in flagrant injustice for a black woman who was sentenced to 20 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marissa Alexander was found guilty of aggravated assault with a firearm. The facts may or not justify the verdict, but that's not my complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander had never been arrested, and as a married mother with a master's degree had the trappings of a law-abiding life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she and her husband had been quarrelling bitterly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fear of him, she says, she went to the garage and came back with a gun to order him to leave. When he refused, she fired warning shots that perhaps could have hurt uninvolved people outside her walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They didn't. But jurors decided she had not fired in self-defense, and found her guilty of aggravated assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seems like probation or a short sentence would make sense. No one was hurt or even shot at. But Florida's stupidly inflexible 10-20-life law gave the judge no chance to be reasonable. Alexander got the mandatory 20 years, as is required when shots are fired during the commission of the crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not evidence of racial bias, or gender bias, or any bias at all, though I do wonder why Alexander's plea offer would have required a three-year sentence. No wonder she rolled the dice on a trial, insisting she did nothing but protect herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plea offer and the verdict are debatable. But even if Alexander went too far, what sane person believes 20 years isn't an extreme injustice when her shots hurt no one and were not intended to?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be great if those so publicly adamant that Zimmerman was unjustly prosecuted would now show commitment to equal justice by speaking just as strongly about this ridiculously cruel injustice for Alexander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any chance of that at all, I wonder?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One trial for George Zimmerman is over, but another one begins. Found not guilty in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Zimmerman is a free man today. But it's unlikely he will be able to resume a normal life anytime soon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions will dog Zimmerman for the rest of his days, including why he saw fit to tail a black teenager wearing a hoodie on a February 2012 night in Sanford, Fla. A licensed, gun-carrying member of a neighborhood-watch group, Zimmerman had called in a suspicious person's notice to a police dispatcher. Zimmerman was told to back off and wait for officers to arrive. He didn't take the advice and, eventually, there was a fatal confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday night, a jury of six women acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree-murder charges in Martin's death. So far, the verdict in this emotionally charged case has produced little violence -- a tribute to all parties, including Martin's family, for asking the public to remain calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But tensions remain high. No matter the verdict, it's still a tragedy. Nothing will bring back Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old black kid who was walking to his father's house when he encountered Zimmerman, 29, who is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Off the hook in his criminal trial, Zimmerman may now wind up in a federal court. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous has launched a petition calling for the U.S. Justice Department to open a civil-rights case against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this what the country needs -- more divisiveness concerning racial attitudes? Maybe it does, just to find the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are not blaming the Florida jury for this verdict. Based on the insufficient prosecutorial evidence presented in court, the jury was compelled to decide that Zimmerman was acting in self-defense under the state's Stand Your Ground Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, justice leaves a bitter taste. After a two-week trial, we still don't know who was the aggressor leading up to the fatal moment in the confrontation. And while Martin, who was unarmed, had gained the upper hand in the fight, according to a witness, it remains questionable as to whether Zimmerman's life was in extreme danger when he fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Zimmerman doesn't have any regrets about that February night, shame on him. He should. He acted irresponsibly. Even police encountering a threatening situation are urged to call for backup; Zimmerman was told to stand down, and he didn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What fears preyed on Zimmerman to do what he did? Was he purely thinking about public safety, or was there something more ominous in his pursuit of Martin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy doesn't end with the Florida verdict. Zimmerman is a free man, but he will never be free from his conscience and the circumstances surrounding Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama's administration pledged Monday to continue a yearlong investigation into Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death and determine whether to file federal charges following a state jury's acquittal of George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Obama took the unusual step of speaking publicly about a case in a state court, he stopped short of criticizing the Florida jury that handed down its verdict late Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, he used the case to push for a series of gun control measures that were defeated earlier this year after an elementary school shooting in Connecticut. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The president wanted to convey that he felt that the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a tragedy for his family, for a community, but also for the country,&quot; said White House spokesman Jay Carney. &quot;And he wanted to express his view that we should ask ourselves if we are doing all that we can to foster compassion and understanding in our communities and to stem the tide of gun violence, as well as how we can prevent future tragedies like this from happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman, 29, who has a white father and a Latina mother, argued that he was defending himself when he shot Martin, 17, as the black teen was walking home through a Sanford, Fla., gated community in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday thatthe case provides an opportunity for the nation todiscuss &quot;complicated and emotionally charged issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are resolved to combat violence involving or directed at young people, to prevent future tragedies and to deal with the underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs and stereotypes that serve as the basis for these too common incidents,&quot;he said at the anniversary celebration of the predominantly African-American sorority Delta Sigma Theta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman's acquittal has led to demonstrations across the nation and questions from civil rights organizations. Hundreds of thousands of people have signed an NAACP petition calling on the Justice Department to launch a civil rights investigation while thousands have signed a White House petition asking Holder to file charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carney said Obama would not get involved in the Justice Department investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a decision made by the Justice Department, by career prosecutors, and all questions about how that process is undertaken should be directed there,&quot; he said. &quot;And that is not something the president involves himself in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIDEBAR:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUROR B37 SPEAKS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MIAMI - Three of the six jurors in George Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial initially favored convicting him of that offense or manslaughter,a juror in the case said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last year, but the jury also was allowed to consider manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The woman known as Juror B37 told CNN's Anderson Cooper that when the jury began deliberations Friday, they took an initial vote. Three jurors - including B37 - were in favor of acquittal, two supported manslaughter and one backed second-degree murder. She said the jury started going through all the evidence, listening to tapes multiple times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That's why it took us so long,&quot; said B37, who plans to write a book on the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When they started looking at the law, the person who initially wanted second-degree murder changed her vote to manslaughter, the juror said. Then they asked for clarification from the judge and went over it again and again. B37 said some jurors wanted to find Zimmerman guilty of something, but there was just no place to go based on the law,</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day after the George Zimmerman verdict was announced, I was at the supermarket. As always, Americans of all races went about their business. An elderly Asian lady got help from a tall Caucasian kid reaching an item on an upper shelf. A black cashier shared a joke with a white customer. A manager who might be Hispanic helped a patron of indeterminate ethnicity with a return. All was calm and composed. Let's call that supermarket America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There's another America that exists on the TV, radio and the cellphone screen. There the race baiters, provocateurs, rumormongers and ratings-mad self-promoters hold court. It's the dark underside of the nation. Let's call it Id America. Those little computers we all carry in our pockets are in some respects the wonder of the age, but there's a dark underside to the wired era. In addition to the profusion and normalization of pornography, the Internet has also served as a vehicle for political pornography. When an emotional story like the Martin/Zimmerman tragedy presents itself for exploitation, the complexities and nuances are buried in an avalanche of deliberate racial incitement. The Internet serves more to inflame than to inform. Rumor is in the saddle and it rides America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Snopes.com, one widely credited story that made the rounds suggested that George Zimmerman's legal bills were being paid by Koch Industries. A much-forwarded email read in part, &quot;The company ... is paying for Zimmerman's legal fees because they feel he had legal right to bear arms and shoot Trayvon. ... We are asking that ... people not buy any of the following items ... Angel Soft toilet paper, Brawny paper towels, Mardi Gras napkins and towels, Quilted Northern toilet paper, Soft and gentile (sic) toilet paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever the merits of avoiding &quot;gentile&quot; toilet paper, which probably isn't kosher under any circumstances, the rumor was false. Koch had nothing to do with Zimmerman's defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the tone of the email, the assertion that a conservative company believes Zimmerman had the &quot;right&quot; to shoot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, was consistent with much of the commentary to be found on MSNBC, CNN and dozens of websites throughout this episode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was wall-to-wall incitement. NBC may be facing a defamation suit for selectively editing a 911 tape to imply that Zimmerman was racially profiling Martin. An MSNBC host called Zimmerman a &quot;murderer.&quot; Commentators like Tavis Smiley summed up the case: &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a child who was racially profiled and gunned down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other side, a photo purporting to be a more recent shot of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin made the rounds. It showed a muscular 6'2&quot; black youth lifting his middle fingers to the camera. But it wasn't Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tavis Smiley insists that &quot;race will get you killed in America.&quot; Advocates for a guilty verdict sport T-shirts saying &quot;Enoughis Enough.&quot; In the alternate universe that the commentators and hustlers like Al Sharpton invent, America is in the grip of an epidemic of violent crimes committed against young black men by white people. That just isn't true. According to the FBI, most blacks are killed by other blacks. The same goes for whites. Blacks are less likely to be killed by whites than whites are to be killed by blacks, but, for the most part, murderers kill fellow members of their melanin class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In supermarket America, no one wants to see anyone's innocent child killed. Among normal Americans there is a common-sense understanding that, based on what we know, it looks like both Martin and Zimmerman (both of whom have had brushes with the law in their pasts) showed poor judgment. That a jury could not say that Zimmerman, his face and head bloodied, acted &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; in a &quot;depraved&quot; state of &quot;ill will, hatred or spite&quot; was an understatement. There was abundant evidence that he was defending himself in the course of a fight. Was he too rash? It's possible, but that wasn't for the jury to say. They were asked only whether his conduct could not by any stretch be considered self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's a terrible tragedy that Martin's life was cut short. It's also a tragedy that our race-baiting provocateurs never tire of waving the bloody shirt in hopes of stirring even more interracial violence and bitterness.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for Rod Blagojevich filed an appeal Monday challenging the imprisoned former Illinois governor's corruption conviction and stiff, 14-year prison term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lengthy filing with the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago comes more than two years after the Chicago Democrat's retrial and 16 months after he entered a federal prison in Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors convicted Blagojevich, 56, of engaging in wide-ranging corruption, including that the two-term governor sought to profit from his power to appoint someone to the U.S. Senate seat that Barack Obama vacated to become president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appeal cites a juror who allegedly expressed a bias against Blagojevich who was seated despite the objections of defense attorneys. It also raises longstanding claims that Judge James Zagel barred FBI wiretap evidence that might have aided the defense and argues the judge miscalculated the appropriate prison term. The appeal was filed about 30 minutes before a midnight deadline to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public to get information in Yahoo case o Yahoo has won a court fight that could help the public learn more about the government's efforts to obtain data from Internet users. The U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which reviews government requests to spy on individuals, ruled Monday that information should be made public about a 2008 case that ordered Yahoo Inc. to turn over customer data. The order requires the government to review which portions of the opinion, briefs and arguments can be declassified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petraeus to teach for $1 o Former CIA director David Petraeus is taking a big salary cut for his visiting professorship at the City University of New York's honors college after being criticized for how much he was getting paid. Petraeus, a hero of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars who quit the CIA in scandal last November after it was uncovered he'd had an affair with his biographer, will teach a seminar at Macaulay Honors College in the next academic year for $1, The New York Times reported Monday. That's down quite a bit from the $200,000 that Gawker.com first reported he was getting paid based on documents it obtained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Man wakes with amnesia, new language o Four months after he was found unconscious in a motel in Palm Springs, Calif., doctors are looking into the mystery of a Florida man who awoke with no memory of his past and speaking only Swedish. Michael Boatwright, 61, woke up with amnesia, calling himself Johan Ek, The Desert Sun reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospital officials said Boatwright may have been in town for a tennis tournament in the Coachella Valley. He was found with a duffel bag of exercise clothes, a backpack and tennis rackets. He also carried four forms of identification - a passport, a California identification card, a veteran's medical card and a Social Security card - all of which identified him as Michael Thomas Boatwright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California won't stop same-sex marriage o The California Supreme Court refused Monday to order the state to immediately stop issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. However, the court still plans to consider whether the governor and attorney general correctly instructed county clerks that a voter-approved ban on gay marriages had become legally invalid statewide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge weighs case pursuing damages for World Trade Center o A federal judge began Monday listening to testimony that will help him decide whether the owners of the World Trade Center buildings destroyed in the Sept. 11 attacks can pursue billions of dollars in damages from aviation companies linked to the hijacked planes. U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein in Manhattan plans to announce his decision as soon as several witnesses conclude testifying in the trial, expected to last about three days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Georgia execution is stayed o A judge has temporarily stayed a Georgia inmate's scheduled execution Monday, after attorneys raised questions involving the state's supply of execution drugs. A lawyer for Warren Lee Hill said the judge planned a hearing Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors picked in teen slaying in Milwaukee o Jurors were selected Monday in the case of a white man, 76, charged with gunning down a black boy, 13, last year on a Milwaukee sidewalk over a theft allegation. In the Milwaukee shooting, which has been compared to the Florida case of George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin, John Henry Spooner is charged with first-degree intentional homicide in the May 2012 death of his next-door neighbor, Darius Simmons, whom Spooner suspected of breaking into his home and stealing guns.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several thousand people carrying handmade signs and chanting &quot;No justice, no peace&quot; snaked through the streets of downtown Minneapolis on Monday evening contending that the acquittal of Florida teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's shooter is a sign of systemic racial injustice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd of diverse ages and races was peaceful but forceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a dozen speakers at the rally on the Hennepin County Government Center plaza demanded justice for Martin and Terrence Franklin, the man killed during a scuffle with Minneapolis police officers this spring. They called for people to urge authorities to use civil rights protections to pursue George Zimmerman, who shot Martin, and the Minneapolis police officers involved in Franklin's shooting. The investigation in the Franklin shooting has been turned over to the Hennepin County attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a young man myself, not much older than Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; said James Jones, 18, of Brooklyn Center. &quot;A lot of people are scared of us, and that's unfair. I'm not scary. I'm a young man trying to get an education. ... I wear a hoodie every day. I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers expected at least 2,500 people to show up to the rally, and the numbers appeared to exceed that prediction, as marchers walked down 6th Street, across Nicollet Mall and zigzagged back onto Hennepin Avenue, halting traffic and drawing attention and support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Brian Herron of Zion Baptist Church in Minneapolis told the crowd to harness the sense of injustice to make the changes they wish to see.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adrian Peterson has demonstrated once again that he's one of the NFL's gentlemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peterson was among the athletes who reacted, and responded appropriately on Twitter, to the not-guilty verdict in the Florida trial of George Zimmerman over the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USA Today reported that Giants star Victor Cruz tweeted, &quot;Zimmerman doesn't last a year before the hood catches up with him.&quot; Cruz later deleted that, explaining himself in tweets and at least one appearance on ESPN's &quot;Mike and Mike&quot; show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falcons wide receiver Roddy White was in an eye-for-an-eye mode, too, when he vented: &quot;All them jurors should go home tonight and kill themselves for letting a grown man get away with killing a kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peterson, the Vikings running back, tweeted this: &quot;My Heart goes out to the Martin Family! Keep the Faith! #God is in control, He's the one and only Judge!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others on Twitter tried to bait Peterson by belittling his tweets, but he stayed cool and logical: &quot;You don't go out looking for trouble!!! Neighborhood Watch means WATCH &amp; report! Not initiate &amp; take things into your own hands ... I'm different if i was in Zimmerman shoes that night. I stay in my car n watch especially known I'm safe with a loaded pistol on my waist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interesting to see that as far as I can tell, Twitter's Larry Fitzgerald has exercised his right not to comment on the verdict. I'm sure he's sent a private message to Trayvon's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One last tweet sent out with little thought came from repeat NBA Champion Dwyane Wade of the Heat: &quot;Wow! Stunned!! Saddened as a father!! Som1 make sense of this verdict for me right now please!!! ... How do I explain this to my boys?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dwyane Wade has been a black male all his life, so he should have no problem explaining that life's especially unfair to some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like a rock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Art Garfunkel treated me to the sounds of silence last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tipster thought he or she saw Garfunkel in the metro a few days after his sold-out &quot;acoustic rehearsal&quot; at the Cedar. To confirm he was here, I called the establishment where I was told Garfunkel was staying. Maybe he'll return my next call if I don't disclose his off-the-beaten-path place of lodging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no answer,&quot; said a woman whom I'm going to identify as Bonnie. &quot;Do you want me to leave a message for him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, please, I told Bonnie, who responded with &quot;Call Ms. C.J.&quot; Bonnie laughed when told that the initials would suffice, although the late Tiny Tim would address me only with the &quot;Ms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he knows you're calling?&quot; asked Bonnie. &quot;No?&quot; she said, laughing at my response. &quot;Do you think he's going to want to call you back?&quot; I told Bonnie she'd be surprised who'll call me back - sometimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;May I ask how you know that he's here?&quot; said Bonnie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Come on, disclosing that wouldn't make my tipster happy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm just sitting by the phone, waiting for Garfunkel to call me, although I think I have a better chance of hearing from Paul Simon, who can call me Al if he wants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was that Spiderman or CJ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MyTalk 107.1's Lori Barghini chickened out of rappelling the 214 feet down the 23-story Hyatt on Nicollet Mall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At media day last week for &quot;Over the Edge,&quot; a fundraiser of the National Youth Recovery Foundation, Barghini came to watch but wouldn't rappel because she didn't want to tempt fate on her birthday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breaking the hearts of some who stood around to watch various media daredevils, I survived the descent. The only reason I was mildly interested in attempting it was that I wanted to shoot a video for startribune.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weird camera angles are the result of the video being shot from what I've named &quot;My Left Ovary Cam,&quot; because the body harness stopped me from hanging the camera where it was originally designed to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C.J. can be reached at cj@startribune.com and seen on FOX 9's &quot;Buzz.&quot; E-mailers, please state a subject; &quot;Hello&quot; does not count. Attachments are not opened.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did the system work? Was justice served? We like to think of those questions as identical. After all, the point of a criminal justice system is to dispense justice. But with the acquittal of George Zimmerman on charges of murdering Trayvon Martin, the system worked yet justice fell short. &lt;0x000A&gt;     This outcome is simultaneously sad but healthy - sad because a 17-year-old boy is dead and his killer walks free; healthy because the verdict seems justified as a matter of law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an important place for emotion in criminal proceedings, both for mercy and for outrage. But the system cannot function if it consistently elevates emotion over rules.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides, naturally, see the Zimmerman verdict through the lens of their own preconceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This will confirm for many that the only problem with the New South is it occupies the same time and space as the Old South,&quot; said NAACP President Benjamin Jealous, invoking the memory of 14-year-old Emmett Till, killed in 1955 after supposedly flirting with a white woman and his murderers acquitted. &quot;Old South justice,&quot; thundered Jesse Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This comparison is unfair. No doubt that race played a role in Martin's death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman likely would not have called the police about a white teenager - even a white teenager wearing a hoodie - walking back from the 7-Eleven. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is no evidence that race played a role in Zimmerman's acquittal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anything, the racial undertones worked against Zimmerman, increasing public pressure on prosecutors to bring the most serious and, in hindsight, difficult to support, charges against him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrast the Zimmerman trial with that of Till's murderers. The courtroom was segregated. No hotel would rent rooms to black observers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local sheriff welcomed black spectators to the courtroom with what was described as a cheerful use of the vilest racial epithet. The New South is not perfect, but it is not the Old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overreaction from the left is mirrored by the overreaction from the right, and without the excuse of being swept away by emotion over a child's unnecessary death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative Roger L. Simon lamented on PJ Media that Zimmerman &quot;will never live a normal life&quot; and described the prosecution as &quot;quite literally, the first American Stalinist 'show trial.' &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is, quite literally, deranged. Of course no decent person responsible for killing an unarmed teenager could &quot;live a normal life.&quot; And the entire point of &quot;show trials&quot; was that the outcome, unlike Zimmerman's acquittal, was foreordained. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which brings us back to the uncomfortable divide between the criminal justice system and justice itself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way to understand that gap is to think of the episode as a video. The criminal justice system zooms in, and properly so, on one short segment, a snapshot in the larger narrative. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever preceded the fight between the two men, the central question, as a matter of criminal law, was precisely what occurred in the immediate moments before Zimmerman fired the fatal shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman instigated the tragic chain of events, but legally that was not relevant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder, prosecutors had to prove that he did something that he knew was &quot;reasonably certain&quot; to kill or seriously injure and acted with &quot;ill will, hatred, spite or an evil intent.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even for the lesser charge of manslaughter, they had to rebut his claim of self-defense, showing that he could not &quot;reasonably believe&quot; shooting Martin was &quot;necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice takes the longer time frame. Zimmerman may not be legally responsible for Martin's death but he remains morally culpable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another way to understand the divide is through the prism of legal rules, which may serve the broader ends of justice but produce unjust results in the short run. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus the exclusionary rule for illegally seized evidence, meaning that some criminals go free because the constable has blundered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, the law's requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt for criminal convictions presumes tolerance for a certain amount of unjust results. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We accept the bargain, in Blackstone's formulation, that it is &quot;better that ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal is not the end of this sad story. Because of the lower burden of proof, a civil lawsuit by Martin's family would have a better chance of success. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal prosecution on civil rights charges would be a mistake; the state trial failed to show adequate evidence of racial animus to sustain such a case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, society must accept: There is not always a perfect fit between a criminal justice system and justice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON | President Barack Obama's administration pledged Monday to continue a yearlong investigation into Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death and determine whether to file federal charges following a state jury's acquittal of George Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Obama took the unusual step of speaking publicly about a case in a state court, he stopped short of criticizing the jury that handed down its verdict late Saturday after a trial broadcast on national television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, he used the case to push for a series of gun control measures that were defeated earlier this year after an elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president wanted to convey that he felt that the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a tragedy for his family, for a community, but also for the country,&quot; White House spokesman Jay Carney said of the shooting death last year of the black teenager. &quot;And he wanted to express his view that we should ask ourselves if we are doing all that we can to foster compassion and understanding in our communities and to stem the tide of gun violence, as well as how we can prevent future tragedies like this from happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, who has a white father and a Latina mother, argued he was defending himself when he shot Martin, 17, as the teen was walking through a Sanford, Fla., gated community in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday that he is mindful of the &quot;pain felt by our nation surrounding the tragic, unnecessary shooting death&quot; of Martin and that the case provides an opportunity for the nation to speak honestly about &quot;complicated and emotionally charged issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are resolved to combat violence involving or directed at young people, to prevent future tragedies and to deal with the underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs and stereotypes that serve as the basis for these too common incidents,&quot; Holder said at the anniversary celebration of the predominantly African-American sorority Delta Sigma Theta. &quot;And we will never stop working to ensure that - in every case, in every circumstance, and in every community - justice must be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder and two other Cabinet members - Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan - will speak Tuesday at the NAACP conference in Orlando, Fla., not far from Sanford. They are expected to speak about gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal has led to scattered demonstrations across the nation and questions from civil rights organizations. On Capitol Hill, few lawmakers weighed in on the case beyond the head of the Congressional Black Caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, told MSNBC that she was &quot;disheartened and troubled&quot; by the verdict. &quot;They put a young black boy on trial for being in his own neighborhood, walking home from the store,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four leaders - House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio; House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.; Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.; and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. - have been uncharacteristically quiet. In answer to a question Sunday on NBC, Reid said he accepted the verdict but planned to take a closer look at Florida's gun laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Was it really self-defence?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That George Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was never in question. What motivated him to do so was. On the night of February 26 last year, Trayvon, 17, was walking through a gated community in Sanford, Florida, when he was spotted by Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer. Zimmerman called the police on a |non-emergency line, telling them he had spotted someone on the estate and telling the dispatcher: &quot;F****** punks. These a*******, they always get away.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Was Trayvon's race important?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This gets to the heart of the matter. Zimmerman's opponents believe he followed Trayvon only because he was |a young black man wearing a hooded top in a predominately white neighbourhood. Zimmerman was ruled to have shot Trayvon in self-defence - cuts and bruises on the back of his head were evidence that the pair had fought, and that was enough for the jury to clear him of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So is self-defence a plausible explanation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On recordings of a 911 call made by one of Zimmerman's neighbours as the pair were fighting, a voice can be heard pleading for help. The prosecution claimed this was Trayvon, begging Zimmerman not to shoot him. The defence said the voice on the tape was in fact their client's, that it was Zimmerman in trouble as Trayvon beat him. Neither side was able to prove who was speaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What about the witnesses?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution's case hinged on testimony from Trayvon's friend, Rachel Jeantel, who was on the phone with him not long before he died. She said Trayvon kept complaining that a man was watching him, and that she heard Trayvon tell someone to &quot;get off&quot; before the line went dead. Jeantel, 18, lied about her age when questioned by police, telling detectives that she was a minor because she &quot;didn't want to get involved&quot;. This, with her evident annoyance under cross-examination, appears to have been enough to discredit her, although the prosecution said attitudes towards her were influenced by the colour of her skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence called an expert witness who claimed the angle of the shot that killed Trayvon proved he was on top of Zimmerman, arguing that the hole in his top indicated that it was hanging away from his body, consistent with someone who was above the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: And the police?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police came in for heavy criticism throughout the trial. Sanford police chief Bill Lee allowed Zimmerman to walk free after he shot Trayvon, insisting there was no evidence to suggest he had not been acting in self-defence, and invoking the state's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which permits those |in fear for their lives to use deadly force. Zimmerman was eventually arrested six weeks after the shooting. - The Independent</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate has already fractured the US along familiar fault lines, with elements of the political left backing the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People's call for an investigation into possible civil rights violations, and the right accusing them of playing the race card. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department says it is restarting its investigation into the 2012 shooting of Martin to consider possible separate hate crime charges against Mr Zimmerman, The New York Times has reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tension is high and bleak memories of race riots that have plagued this country have been reawakened. In this context it is perhaps understandable that another crucial debate is being drowned out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People appear to have forgotten that when race first became a factor in this case it was because for six weeks after the shooting Mr Zimmerman was neither arrested nor charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In large part this was due to Florida's so-called stand-your-ground law, introduced in 2005, that made shooting people dead on that state's streets far more likely to be legal than it used to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is so often the case, Florida was an early adopter of a law being championed by conservative activists and, in this case, drafted by the National Rifle Association. Stand-your-ground laws, known by critics as shoot first laws, extend the so-called castle doctrine from the home to the street, making it legal to use lethal force against someone in public if you &quot;reasonably&quot; believe yourself to be at significant risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In doing so they reverse the onus of proof. Where once someone who killed a person had to prove they had acted in self-defence, under stand-your-ground laws the prosecution must prove the accused did not feel they were at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laws also expressly remove the requirement that once existed in the use of self-defence that a person retreat if given the opportunity. That is, under stand-your-ground laws, killing someone in a fight need not be the last option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, given that the sole witness to such incidents are often the accused and the person they have killed, stand-your-ground is proving quite a handy defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyer and former prosecutor Matt Mangino says that under stand-your-ground laws it could well be legal to get into a dispute with a neighbour, allow the quarrel to descend into a scuffle and, if you feared significant harm, to shoot him dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a case that is to be tried soon in the Florida town of Port St Joe, Walt Butler, a white man, is using stand-your-ground in his defence for shooting his neighbour Everett Gant, a coloured man who had confronted Mr Butler about a racial slur against a child in their apartment complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Butler shot Mr Gant between the eyes with a rifle, called police, then finished making his dinner, a local newspaper reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Maningo said he has come across cases in which drug dealers use stand-your-ground as a defence after shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Florida introduced its law, 30 other states - almost all of them conservative - have followed suit. Many simply copied Florida's legislation or used draft laws written by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group that seeds laws among the states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, Mr Zimmerman did not resort to the stand-your-ground argument in court, instead relying on straightforward self-defence. Nonetheless, the ease with which self-defence is invoked in murder cases is clearly on Floridians' minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than half an hour after the verdict on Mr Zimmerman was handed down, Florida's Senate's Democratic leader Chris Smith issued a statement calling for a re-examination of all self-defence laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that a child is dead and an armed man can now walk free without so much as a backward glance sends the wrong message to Florida and its citizens,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If someone makes the claim of self defence and the only other witness to the confrontation is dead, there needs to be a higher standard for proving that the use of deadly force was justified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little chance of any real debate in Florida, where the state legislature remains in the hands of the conservative Tea Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Columbia University law professor Jeffrey Fagan says stand-your-ground laws are perfectly suited to a conservative world view. They speak of mistrust of government and its agencies; they privatise public space and promote individualism at its most rugged, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He notes that they are an extension of a long history of American citizens using violence as self-help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lynchings, riots, civil disobedience and vigilantism are all expressions of individual or collective action that reject both legal norms and the authority of state actors,&quot; he has written.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murder rates have not risen in Florida since stand-your-ground laws were introduced, and supporters see this as evidence that they are working safely and as intended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man who has studied them more broadly, Texas A&amp;M University economist Mark Hoekstra, disagrees. &quot;These laws lower the cost of using lethal force,&quot; he told National Public Radio in January. &quot;Our study finds that homicides go up by 7 to 9 per cent in states that pass the laws, relative to states that didn't pass the laws, over the same time period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mr Zimmerman's case hinged on self-defence, stand-your-ground language still found its way into the court case, with instructions given to the jury declaring, &quot;If George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or another, or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As long as force meets deadly force, and as long as citizens are relieved of the &quot;duty to retreat&quot;, Professor Fagan expects more people to die as Trayvon&nbsp;Martin did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that Mr Zimmerman is eligible to have his handgun returned to him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GEORGE Zimmerman will now carry the same gun he used to kill Trayvon Martin -- and he's going to need it, his lawyer says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyer Mark O'Mara said Zimmerman's acquittal by a Florida jury means he'll get back the Kel Tec-9 pistol he used to fatally shoot Martin last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Zimmerman, 29, intends to alway carry the weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``(There's) even more reason now, isn't there? There are a lot of people out there who actually hate him, though they shouldn't,'' O'Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's brother, Robert Jr, said George had no regrets over the deadly confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Regret implies that your actions you have culpability in what you did for what happened. What you're asking is, `Does he share or accept the blame?' George, outside of the word blame, feels and has felt, very bad,'' he said. But he insisted his brother had nothing to apologise for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I don't think people who are forthcoming and forthright in what they do and believe they're doing the right thing should then go back,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Justice Department has responded to appeals to probe whether Zimmerman committed any civil rights violations in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, book agent Sharlene Martin confirmed today that one of the jurors is to write a book explaining the verdict, claiming she was contacted by juror B-37 the day after the verdict and signed her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The reader will learn why jurors had no option but to find Zimmerman not guilty due to the manner in which he was charged and the content of the jury instructions,'' Martin said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us give the jury the benefit of the doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us assume that, within the narrow constraints of the evidence at hand and Florida's bizarre gun laws, six good women rendered the only verdict they could Saturday night in acquitting George Zimmerman of murder and manslaughter in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Even so, the problem remains. Whatever legal closure it gives, this verdict does not satisfy, any more than a guilty verdict would have, the central moral question here:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why did Zimmerman regard Trayvon as suspicious when all he did was wear a hooded sweatshirt while walking in the rain? Why did initial police reports designate Trayvon the suspect when he was actually the unarmed victim? Why was his assailant able to go home that same night?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents have consistently rejected any notion that race played a role in his death. It was a smart position, reflecting a recognition that when race enters the conversation, reason often exits, compassion following close behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But truth is, race has been there at every turn. If man and boy had both been black or white, we would never have heard of either. There likely would not even have been a shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many of us as African-Americans, that night was a recurring nightmare driven to a horrific conclusion. It was the driving-while-black traffic stops, the born suspect joke that isn't, the cost of being black in a nation that considers black the natural color of criminality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people - most of them white and on the furthest right of the political spectrum - will disagree. For them, Zimmerman is the victim here, a man who acted justifiably to defend himself. Race, they will say, did not enter the picture except afterward, when he was thrown to the mob because of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And you wonder: What color is the sky in their world?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years ago, What Would You Do?, an ABC hidden-camera TV show, set up a situation in which two actors posed as bike thieves in a public park, using bolt cutters and hack saws to cut a bike chain. The results were instructive. Over the course of an hour, a hundred people passed the white thief by with barely a glance. The black one had hardly gotten to work before a crowd of whites gathered around him, interrogating him, lecturing him, calling 911, even shooting cellphone video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did race explain the disparity? Not at all, a white man who had harassed the black actor assured the cameras. He could've been any color, it wouldn't have mattered to me. He doubtless believed what he said. For some of us, though, it has a tired, heard-before quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, after all, the kind of thing some people always say when you complain of voter ID laws that will peel black voters off the rolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or when you condemn Republican presidential candidates for using welfare as a dog-whistle word of racial acrimony. Or when an unarmed boy is killed and the man who did the killing doesn't even spend the night in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the answer to the moral questions that killing raises is not mysterious to some of us. We know how America is. We know, for instance, that it regards black men as inherently criminal, jails them disproportionately because of that belief, then points to the fact that they are disproportionately jailed as proof of that belief. We know, in other words, that where people who look like Trayvon are concerned, America is a little nuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we know what stalked Trayvon down that street last year. We know what killed him. And we know why the people who were paid to give a damn about that, didn't. You see, we have not the luxury of self-delusion. We have sons and grandsons and nephews, and we must teach them, too, how America is. They are cocky and invincible in the way boys always are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they all look like Trayvon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights groups and even Democrat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  are urging the Justice Department to pursue a federal case against George Zimmerman, who was acquitted by a Florida jury in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Sanford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We see no purpose in the agency trying to prove Zimmerman committed a hate crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state trial did not reveal a racial motive. Contrary to early misleading media reports, Zimmerman described Martin as black only after being asked by a 911 operator. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman did think the teenager, who was returning from a convenience store, was up to no good in a neighborhood where a number of homes had been burglarized. But there has been no suggestion Zimmerman set out to shoot anyone, particularly because of their race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By following Martin against the instructions of the 911 official, Zimmerman precipitated a tragic encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But poor judgment is not a hate crime. Even Attorney General Eric Holder acknowledged as much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN reports that last year Holder said, For a federal hate crime we have to prove the highest standard in the law. Something that was reckless, that was negligent does not meet that standard. We have to show that there was specific intent to do the crime with requisite state of mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless there is evidence that was not revealed during the trial, it would be impossible for federal prosecutors to make such a case against Zimmerman. A trial would only waste tax dollars and inflame emotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the Justice Department's objectivity in the case is questionable. Last week legal watchdog Judicial Watch revealed documents it claimed showed an agency within the Justice Department was deployed to Sanford to help organize rallies seeking Zimmerman's prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice officials say its representatives simply sought to reduce tension. Still, the possibility the Justice Department was pressuring state and local officials to charge Zimmerman merits more scrutiny.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's  death was a tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the jury carefully weighed all the evidence and concluded that Zimmerman  committed no crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal trial won't change the evidence and is unlikely to produce a different outcome.</SPAN></P>

Tell them to watch out who they pick a fight with, and better still, it's probably not a good idea to settle differences by fighting. Tell them to direct all that anger and aggression toward bettering themselves at school, that with a good education the sky's the limit on what they can do. Tell them that this country offers boundless opportunity for those who work hard and obey the laws. And then give them a big hug!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is not equal justice in this country, and I say so as a white man who felt O.J. Simpson was guilty.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I grew up in Tampa and graduated from Hillsborough High School in the early 1970s. HHS was a naturally integrated high school. I am Hispanic. Every day I had classes with whites, Hispanics and black kids. I really never thought twice about who was sitting in class. I have tried to remember when I first started to become hyper-vigilant around black males I didn't know. I believe it was after the whole saggy pants, bad-ass image became a stereotype. I read every day about the sickening crime rates in urban cities like Chicago. This reinforces fear. When I see black males dressed in the stereotypical thug or urban style, I become hyper-vigilant (profile?). I hate it; however, it is human nature. I don't consider myself racist, but maybe some blacks would. I must admit I don't feel fear when I see black guys dressed in other styles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to be educated on how to work on changing my perception. Any ideas?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case not proved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the American press George Zimmerman was guilty; to most TV commentators he was guilty. Jesse Jackson said so. Al Sharpton said so. Most of those gathered outside the courthouse in Sanford had already convicted Zimmerman of something, and the Justice Department is contemplating filing federal civil rights charges. Why have a jury? Why not just a lynch mob?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Zimmerman had been convicted, would those who say the justice system is broken draw the same conclusion? It wasn't long ago when O.J. Simpson was on trial for murder. The verdict left the majority of African-Americans rejoicing and the majority of white Americans stunned with disbelief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fast forward to the Zimmerman trial. The prosecution didn't prove its case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tribune editorial of July 15, The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict, says it best: Yet the fact remains: A teenager is dead for no good reason. Zimmerman may not have committed a crime, but he caused a tragedy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict: Again, your paper is so biased. Zimmerman's life will never be the same. It is a tragedy for both Zimmerman and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family. He was the only one volunteering for the neighborhood watch that evening. Your audacity to insinuate reckless behavior is out of line, and you should abide by the verdict from Zimmerman's peers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'How can I help you?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You missed the point in your Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict conclusion, as have most other politically correct conclusions I have read and heard. The pivotal question is: At the critical point of visual and verbal contact between Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and George Zimmerman, why did that confrontation devolve so quickly  into a sucker punch and ground and pound? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer is that the media manipulates news toward controversy, sports glorify fighting and retaliation, and thinking takes a back seat to testosterone reactions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps when two strangers meet they should each assume that the other is armed, smile at each other and ask, How can I help you?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When in 1992 a California jury acquitted the four officers who beat Rodney King, the result was a race riot of a kind not seen since the late 1960s - followed by a federal civil-rights prosecution that convicted two of the officers. The acquittal of George Zimmerman for killing Trayvon Martin hasn't produced rioting, but it has spawned a growing demand, led by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, for a federal trial to re-charge Zimmerman with violating Martin's civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laws have changed since 1992 to make bringing such a prosecution easier than it would once have been. Yet the likelihood of getting a conviction would be extremely small - and instead of placating people who feel aggrieved by the first trial, another failed prosecution might make race relations in America worse, not better. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In years past, it would have been difficult if not impossible to bring a federal civil-rights charge against a private citizen such as Zimmerman who attacked another citizen on the street. Civil rights crimes then extended to government officials acting under color of law, or to private citizens who injured other citizens who were engaged in a set of federally protected activities. These included going to school, registering to vote or trying to make use of a public accommodation such as a lunch counter or soda fountain. The federal laws, in other words, were designed to cover the classic civil rights situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That changed in 2009 when Congress passed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. The law is often called the Matthew Shepard Act for short and is best known for making it a crime to injure someone because of sexual orientation. But Byrd was an African-American murdered by white supremacists in Texas in 1998, and the law actually began by removing the requirement of a federally protected activity for racially motivated crimes. Under the act, bodily injury is a federal crime if committed because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin of any person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the surface, this clearly phrased law would seem to make conviction relatively straightforward. All the prosecution would have to do is show that Zimmerman's attack on Martin was racially motivated. There is no need to prove that Martin was on a public street or that Zimmerman was trying to deprive him of a civil right. Passed pursuant to Congress' authority under the 13th Amendment to remove all incidents and badges of slavery, the law also doesn't require the prosecution to show any awkward link to Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet how, exactly, would the federal government prove Zimmerman's motivation? Testimony from a former co-worker who claims that Zimmerman made racist, anti-Arab comments on the job would likely not be admissible. Zimmerman's possible racial slur on the tape of his conversation with the 911 operator while after Martin (arguably, coon) might conceivably be admitted as probative. But a single phrase that is difficult to interpret on the tape is unlikely to be enough to convince a jury that Martin's race was the cause of the attack. Even if a jury accepted that Zimmerman suspected Martin and pursued him because of his race, the defense attorneys would argue that the actual shooting was motivated by self-defense, not race. And one jury already apparently bought some version of the self-defense story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could be argued, with some force, that the Justice Department should bring federal charges even if the odds of success are slim. The fact of a federal prosecution would show that the government takes hate crimes seriously. Even with scant chances of success, the fact of prosecution might vindicate federal interest in preserving the right of everyone to walk the streets without being attacked, regardless of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trouble would arise when another jury - as it probably would - acquits Zimmerman. Instead of the bottom-line message being that the government wants to protect all its citizens from hate crimes, events might underscore that in 2013, a white-appearing American can still shoot an unarmed African-American teenager and get away with it not once but twice. One acquittal could perhaps be explained away by the vagaries of the jury system or the particularities of the culture of self-defense as symbolized by Florida's stand your ground law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second acquittal would mean something different. Because the charge would be that Zimmerman acted with racial animus, the verdict might be perceived as saying that the public didn't believe race was in issue here at all - or worse, that the public didn't care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question for advocates then would be simple: Would you still support bringing charges even if you believed Zimmerman would get off again?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequences of failure here are serious. This time, prudence might counsel letting the coin flip of the Florida jury verdict - however outrageous - stand as the last word.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a difference between respecting the jury's verdict clearing George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin and acknowledging the essential injustice of a Florida law that all but encourages reckless behavior. The verdict Saturday says less about race in America than it does this nation's capacity for violence. Another innocent life has been lost, and the nation searches again for some meaning beyond that the tragedy was lawful. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury late Saturday cleared Zimmerman of second-degree murder and a lesser charge of manslaughter in the February 2012 fatal shooting of Martin in the Central Florida city of Sanford. The neighborhood watch volunteer had ignored a police dispatcher's advice and followed the 17-year-old as he walked home from a convenience store in a gated, suburban community. Zimmerman - concerned about burglaries in the area - confronted Martin, and claimed he shot the unarmed teen in self-defense after Martin knocked him to the ground and beat his head on the concrete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution presented an incoherent narrative at trial, but the case was hard from the start. Authorities initially sent mixed signals about whether a crime took place, and race (Martin was black, Zimmerman is Hispanic) interjected a sharp and polarizing emotion into the case. The jurors owe the nation some insight into what led to an acquittal; a fuller understanding of the verdict could ease public tensions. But a major factor was the Florida law that gives people wide latitude to use deadly force to defend themselves - even if they cause the confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zimmerman did not seek immunity from charges under &quot;stand your ground,&quot; he apparently benefited from a less-discussed part of the 2005 law that expanded protections for using force in self-defense. Before the law, defendants had to show that they used every reasonable means to avoid danger before using force. But &quot;stand your ground&quot; removed the obligation to retreat in most circumstances. Zimmerman not only had no legal duty to retreat, the judge said in jury instructions, but the right to stand his ground and meet force with force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the most comprehensive effort of its kind, the Tampa Bay Times last year examined 200 &quot;stand your ground&quot; cases and found that the law has worked to free killers and violent attackers whose self-defense claims seem questionable at best. In nearly a third of the cases examined by the Times, defendants initiated the fight - and still went free. A former Republican state senator who sponsored the bill said the law was never meant to protect defendants who put themselves in harm's way. But the criminal justice system has been blind to that intent, as defendants merely have to show reasonable cause to fear bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most productive way to channel the frustration with the verdict is to change Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law to recognize that individuals who initiate confrontations are not then immune from responsibility of the consequences. Legitimate self-defense cases would still be protected, but it would remove the near-amnesty that people have to act recklessly, putting themselves and others in harm's way. The law as it stands is an invitation to more bloodshed and heartache, and a society more divided.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the state had originally charged George Zimmerman with manslaughter instead of second-degree murder, the verdict could have very possibly been guilty. In Florida, the definition of manslaughter includes someone doing something on purpose that could cause someone to die without thinking of that possibility and someone dies. Also, doing something stupid or (failure to do something smart) and someone dies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury heard the complete trial based on second-degree murder with little understanding of manslaughter, allowed at the last minute. They questioned the court on manslaughter but only received a reply asking what more they wanted to know. They did not respond and found Zimmerman not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was the state at fault for not pursuing manslaughter in the first place? Was the court itself at fault for not giving full details of a manslaughter charge when jurors asked for it instead of asking what more they wanted to know?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They did their duty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I must disagree with Eric Deggans' call for jurors to explain themselves. I fervently hope that the judge will not reconsider her decision to keep jurors' names from the public. This case and the Casey Anthony case are exactly why TV cameras should be barred from courtrooms. Armchair jurors, prosecutors and defense attorneys hang on every word or implication and make their own decisions with no knowledge other than that of the so-called experts provided by cable television. Then when the actual verdict does not comport with their decision, there is chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;race card&quot; was played immediately after Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was killed, and it has continued to be played by cable TV, along with the &quot;he was only a kid&quot; card. As was pointed out in a New York Times article, &quot;Trials, for better or worse, are not morality plays.&quot; Prosecutors had a weak case from the start, and there were missteps by both them and the police. I disagreed with the juries in both this and the Casey Anthony case. However, I firmly agree with the president's statement: &quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increasing focus on charter and fundamental schools implies an interest in what school leaders and politicians have long been unwilling to grant - that education of our children requires the buy-in of the community, not just students and teachers. Aside from the rules and curriculum found in charter and fundamental schools, the big difference between those schools and regular schools is the buy-in from parents. Our daughter attended Academie Da Vinci elementary school in Dunedin (a public charter school) and Clearwater Fundamental Middle School (a public fundamental school). The quality of education at both schools is excellent, as are the staffs. Parents and children have to sign agreements to abide by rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any school can use the same formula. Are we willing to make these commitments to help our children? If not, all the testing, schemes, and hard work of teachers and students will not be enough.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;George Zimmerman's fear for his life, not Florida's controversial law, led to the verdict, experts say.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A juror in the George Zimmerman trial broke her silence Monday night on national TV to say Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws played a role in the decision to acquit the Sanford neighborhood watch captain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the woman, identified only as Juror B37, also said she had &quot;no doubt&quot; Zimmerman feared for his life in the final moments of his struggle with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, and that was the definitive factor in the verdict. The juror spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That matched the assessment of legal experts who earlier Monday were describing the verdict on Saturday as the result of successful, garden-variety self-defense arguments that could sway a jury in any state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though these observers said Florida's expanded self-defense law, which says citizens can &quot;stand their ground&quot; rather than retreat in the face of a deadly threat has emboldened citizens to take unnecessary risks and led to an increase in homicides, they detected little impact on the Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, waived his right for a pretrial immunity hearing, allowed under &quot;stand your ground&quot; law. Although the words &quot;stand your ground&quot; were seldom heard during the five-week trial, protesters have called for the repeal of &quot;stand your ground&quot; in light of the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experienced prosecutors and law professors agreed that they think jurors were swayed by basic self-defense arguments made by Zimmerman's attorneys: Regardless of who initiated the encounter, at the moment the deadly shot was fired, Zimmerman feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can see a similar outcome in jurisdictions without 'stand your ground' for the mere fact that the best eyewitness to counter the defense strategy was dead,&quot; said Darren Lenard Hutchinson, a professor of race and civil rights law at the University of Florida Levin College of Law. &quot;That's the terrible reality. The jurors saw a bloodied nose and that may have been enough for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors were also instructed by the judge that if they had &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; about the second-degree murder or manslaughter charges against Zimmerman, they had no choice but to find him not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Dekle, a retired prosecutor who also teaches at UF Law, said, &quot;'Stand your ground' turns out to have been a huge red herring (in the Zimmerman case.) The result very well could have been the same prior to enactment of the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dekle, a critic of &quot;stand your ground&quot; provisions, said that even if a person initiates a fight, they always have had the right to defend themselves if they're in fear of death or great bodily harm. &quot;You don't forfeit your right to do whatever you need to do to live simply because you've been a jerk,&quot; Dekle said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those comments are no surprise to Sen. Tom Lee, Republican from Brandon, who was president of the Florida Senate when stand your ground legislation was passed in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have yet to talk to anyone who believes the stand your ground provisions were remotely relevant to this case,&quot; said Lee, who believes the law is working the way it was intended. &quot;For me, this case centered on your right to defend yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee said that's why the Sanford police did not immediately arrest Zimmerman after he acknowledged killing Martin in February 2012 and why the prosecutor initially decided not to prosecute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But once the prosecution decided to try the case, the questions were:Did Zimmerman have a right to defend himself? Was there an environment that evening that gave a reasonable person belief he or she was in danger? That's traditional self-defense,&quot; Lee said. &quot;He still had a right to defend himself because he was in fear of his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stand your ground&quot; may have had little impact on the criminal case, but it might have repercussions if Martin's parents bring a civil suit against Zimmerman. If Zimmerman was granted immunity under the law by a civil court judge, the Martins would have to pay his legal fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can imagine protesters thinking a civil suit would be the next-best remedy, &quot; said Susan Rozelle, professor at Stetson University College of Law. &quot;But the family is unfairly burdened by the fear of having to pay costs if it loses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though there was some pressure to revamp the stand your ground laws when the Zimmerman case first became public, that pressure quickly dissipated. A task force created by Gov. Rick Scott to review the law included many of the statute's supporters and resulted in few meaningful proposals. Even those, however, failed to get a hearing during the last legislative session, as lawmakers cited the ongoing legal case against Zimmerman and more pressing issues as an excuse for shelving any discussion of the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Chris Smith, a Democrat from Fort Lauderdale, hopes the public outcry over the Zimmerman verdict will change that, especially if jurors say it had an impact on their deliberation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That statute was poorly written; any reasonable society would want it changed,&quot; Smith said. &quot;People are looking for action steps, they're shocked by the outcome. Now we need to push the Legislature to at least have this debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It feels wrong, this verdict of not guilty for George Zimmerman. It feels wrong to say that Mr. Zimmerman is guilty of no crime. If he hadn't approached 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, if he hadn't pulled his gun, Mr. Martin would be alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that doesn't mean Mr. Zimmerman was guilty of murder, not in the state of Florida. It doesn't even mean he was guilty of manslaughter, though that was the middle ground I hoped the jury would find its way toward. (And in fact, the jurors asked for a clarification on the manslaughter charge during its 16-and-a-half hours of deliberation.) Here's the problem: To convict Mr. Zimmerman of murder, the six women of the jury had to find that he killed Mr. Martin out of ill will, hatred, or spite, or with a depraved mind. The law didn't account for Mr. Zimmerman's fear or feeling of being physically threatened. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the physical evidence suggested that in the heat of the moment, Mr. Zimmerman could have felt both of those things. A forensics expert testified that from the angle of his wounds, it appeared that Mr. Martin was on top of Mr. Zimmerman when he was shot. The neighbour who came closest to being an eyewitness- there were none - said it looked to him like he saw a fight in which the person on top, straddling the person below, was wearing a red or a light-coloured shirt. That, too, suggested Mr. Martin was on top. Mr. Zimmerman did have injuries: lacerations to the back of his head from the pavement and a swollen bloody nose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true that there was also evidence on the other side: None of Mr. Zimmerman's DNA was found under Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's fingernails. None of Mr. Martin's DNA was found on the gun. These facts contradict key aspects of the account Mr. Zimmerman gave police. Why believe him about the rest of his account? And even if you do give him the benefit of that doubt, why did Mr. Zimmerman feel so very threatened? Why did he pull his gun and shoot to kill?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know. I don't think we ever will. Mr. Zimmerman didn't testify; he was never cross-examined. &quot;Zimmerman the man may remain as much an enigma as the events of the night in question,&quot; Jelani Cobb wrote in the New Yorker earlier this week. And all of this focus on the moment of the shooting telescopes this story in a way that feels misleading. It leaves out George Zimmerman's history of calling the cops on black people and his decision that night to follow Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. It leaves out his excruciatingly terrible, patently racist judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that doesn't mean the jury's verdict was racist. In Florida, a person &quot;who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked&quot; has no duty to retreat. He or she has the right to &quot;meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury could have faulted Mr. Zimmerman for starting the altercation with Mr. Martin and still believed him not guilty of murder, or even of manslaughter, which in Florida is a killing that has no legal justification. If the jury believed that once the physical fight began, Mr. Zimmerman reasonably feared he would suffer a grave bodily injury, then he gets off for self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe that is the wrong rule. Maybe people like George Zimmerman should be held responsible for provoking the fight that they then fear they'll lose. And maybe cuts to the back of the head and a bloody nose aren't enough to show reasonable fear of grave bodily harm. After all, as Adam Weinstein points out, the lesson right now for Floridians is this: &quot;in any altercation, however minor, the easiest way to avoid criminal liability is to kill the counterparty.&quot; But you can see the box the jurors might have felt they were in. Even if they didn't like George Zimmerman - even if they believed only part of what he told the police - they didn't have a charge under Florida law that was a clear fit for what he did that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what Slate's Justin Peters meant when he reminded us earlier this week that the state has to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. &quot;That hasn't happened,&quot; he wrote. &quot;And if the prosecution can't prove its case, then George Zimmerman should walk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is our legal system. It doesn't always deliver justice, and this case surely points to several ways in which Florida's version of law and police work should change. It may demonstrate that Mr. Zimmerman should face federal civil rights charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what matters most is that Mr. Zimmerman was charged with Mr. Martin's killing, even if he wasn't convicted. The state was late to indict him, yes, and acted only after a sorry spell of botched police work that may have affected the evidence presented at trial. But Florida did try to hold George Zimmerman liable fo r Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Martin's family and all his supporters get most of the credit. His father, Tracy Martin, wrote on Twitter tonight, &quot;God blessed Me &amp;Sybrina with Tray and even in his death I know my baby proud of the FIGHT we along with all of you put up for him GOD BLESS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, they did fight, and their battle meant something - meant a great deal - to so many parents of black boys in hoodies, and to the rest of the country, too. Tracy Martin is right to stress that fight for justice at this sorrowful, painful moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No ill-conceived law, and no verdict, can take that away.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida vigilante who killed the teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is to get his gun back because he has &quot;even more reason&quot; to carry it amid a wave of public anger over his murder acquittal, his lawyer says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kel-Tec PF9 semi-automatic pistol that fired the fatal bullet into the 17-year-old's heart will be handed over to George Zimmerman, 29, who is in hiding after Saturday's not guilty verdict by a jury in Sanford, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even more reason now, isn't there?&quot; said his lead lawyer, Mark O'Mara, when asked if his client would resume carrying the firearm. &quot;A lot more people out there actually hate him, though they shouldn't.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Neighbourhood Watch volunteer has been the subject of death threats since the incident in February last year, which came about after he wrongly identified the black hoodiewearing teenager as &quot;suspicious&quot;. Mr Zimmerman claims that after he started following Trayvon, the boy lashed out at him, slammed his head on the pavement and told him: &quot;You gonna die tonight.&quot; The trial was told that Mr Zimmerman was in reasonable fear for his life and fired in self-defence - justification under Florida law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He believes truly in his heart that if he didn't have that weapon that night, he might not be here,&quot; said Mr O'Mara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State prosecutors accused Mr Zimmerman of giving a false account of the fight and argued that he was a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; who acted out of ill-will. Public tensions over the case have pivoted on perceptions that Trayvon was shot because he was black, though the investigation did not find any hint of racism in Mr Zimmerman's past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protest rallies have been held in a number of US cities, calling for the Government to file civil rights charges against him. A prayer vigil was held in Sanford last night and demonstrations are being organised around the country on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, there has been vociferous backing from members of the public supporting Mr Zimmerman's legal right to use a weapon in selfdefence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the chance to relive the night all over again, Mr Zimmerman has said that he would do nothing differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wore a bulletproof vest for some of his three-week trial and always wears it when out in public, though he lives incognito at an undisclosed location, believed to be outside Florida. &quot;He has a legitimate fear, a legitimate concern,&quot; said Mr O'Mara. &quot;He will never be able to just walk down the street and not worry about who's looking at him or who's walking up behind him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comment drew derision from supporters of the dead teenager, who said that walking along a street without being followed was exactly what the teenager should have been able to expect himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jasmine Rand, an attorney for the Martin family, said: &quot;The words I've heard come from O'Mara and from George Zimmerman saying he would kill Trayvon&nbsp;Martin all over again - it's an extraordinary level of arrogance. Those words and those feelings have no place in my personal faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fear begets violence and violence begets fear. The more people we have carrying guns, the more violence we get.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Mantei, a state attorney in the case, said: &quot;The law allows an awful lot of people to carry guns. It doesn't mean they all should.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amonth or so after America elected its first non-white president I was in a gun shop in South Carolina. The term &quot;gun shop&quot; doesn't really do this place justice; it was a gun cathedral, a huge windowless warehouse whose walls were covered in rifles and knives and traps and - for wussies - pepper sprays and assorted less lethal paraphernalia. But the big guns were the pride and joy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The friendly owner had agreed to let the BBC come and film a few sequences for a longer piece about gun laws and gun ownership. He let us loose off a couple of rounds in the testing range at the back. The time came to leave. &quot;So just to check,&quot; I asked, &quot;if we wanted to buy this weapon [it was a semi-automatic rifle], you would let me?&quot; &quot;Well ...&quot; he looked genuinely crestfallen. &quot;I gotta say there's a problem. You could have the gun for sure, but see the thing is, I can't sell you no ammunition.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why not? &quot;Because we've run out ...&quot; Wow. The rest of the world was on a high. Much of America was on a high. But in rural South Carolina they spat out their chewing tobacco, cranked up the pickup truck and headed into town to get in line for ammo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of this has nothing to do with racism. Some rural Americans genuinely believed that this new president - who was not from these parts - might have designs on their guns. Although he had not campaigned for changes in gun laws he might still change his mind; best to err on the side of caution in the field of ammunition just as one might stock up on old-fashioned light bulbs or anything else that might soon be difficult to come by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many Americans - when I have told them that story - have winced. It reminds them of something dark, something buried but refusing to die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's division between black and white is not the same as the divisions that exist in British and other societies. In America there is a crucial added ingredient. A poison: slavery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is why the sense of injustice felt by many Americans over Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death at the hands of George Zimmerman is so profound. A black man (a boy really) was confronted and when he fought back he was killed. He was wronged and then punished. Remind you of anything? It reminds many Americans - black and white - of the crack of the slave-owner's whip. During the trail it was revealed that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had made a phone call minutes before he was killed in which he talked of being followed by &quot;a creepy-ass cracker&quot;. Cracker is a mild form of racial abuse black people can use about whites - its origins are disputed but some say the crack is the crack of that whip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That whip. Someone called it America's Original Sin. Like Original Sin, slavery in this narrative hovers in the background of American life, demanding eternal atonement, never capable of being quenched. Not by the constitutional amendment that ended it. Not by the end (many years later) of formal discrimination. Not by the election of President Obama. Not by anything Americans seem capable of doing or saying or thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is what depresses many of those who long for post-racial America to emerge. The whip, they believe, still oppresses blacks because (and this is the really important point) the whip is now the mental image that many white people have of their black fellow citizens: they are frightened of them. Deep down, they wish they'd go away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all Americans are so pessimistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed plenty think the racial aspect of the Martin case has been overdone; stoked by politicians and media people who want to tell a story that makes ears prick up and eyeballs stay on screens. If you look at the Florida law that allows self-defence - standing your ground - it simply says that victims of an attack can defend themselves when they think they are in great danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I remember when they passed the law; it was 2005 and social conservatives were on a roll. George W. Bush had just been re-elected and Florida Republicans, encouraged by the gun lobby, wanted to cash in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps they knew the old joke about the Miami tourist board slogan in the bad old days when crime was at its height: &quot;Come back to Miami, we weren't shooting at you!&quot; I think they genuinely believed it would reduce crime - and to this day some claim that it has. At any rate the &quot;stand your ground&quot; rules applied - and apply today - to all Floridians of any ethnicity. You can shoot someone who threatens you. Period, as the Americans say. Mr Zimmerman's defence team even claimed that their man would not have stood trial had he been black. The racial politics - the product of Original Sin - had been superimposed once again, they suggested, on modern American life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what does America do now? The big decision is this: Eric Holder, the Attorney-General, has to decide whether to take up federal civil rights charges against Mr Zimmerman, in a trial many would regard as proper justice, and many as a witch hunt. Plenty of ammunition for the race pessimists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And for the optimists, well, here's a glimmer, though it will not be much comfort to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents. Mr Holder, the man in the hot seat, is black - the first African-American to hold the post. Whatever he decides, the fact of him being the decider is, perhaps, just perhaps, progress.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman fatally shot the 17-year-old African-American while in Sanford, Florida in February last year. Prior to the shooting, Zimmerman had said he believed the 17-year-old was behaving in a suspicious manner though, according to the police report, there was no indication that Martin was engaged in criminal activity at the time. <BR> Zimmerman was found not guilty by a Florida jury on Saturday.<BR> The Hollywood Reporter stated that Beyonc&eacute; dedicated Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You and her own song, Halo, to Martin at a show in Nashville. <BR> Rihanna changed her Instagram profile picture to solid black, then posted a picture of the youngster with a message reading: &quot;A child was gunned down for no reason! And nothing about that sounds like murder? My baby brother is 17, this rocked my whole sh*t! #thesystemisandhasalways beenph**ked [sic].&quot; <BR> Vibe magazine reported that Wyclef Jean released a song called Justice (If You're 17) as a tribute to Martin. <BR> US President Barack Obama called for people to respect the verdict. <BR> Selected celebrity tweets:<BR> oNicki Minaj (@NICKI MINAJ): &quot;And our taxes paid for that trial. We just paid to see a murderer walk free after killing an innocent unarmed little boy. #GodBlessAmerica.&quot;<BR> oRick Ross (@Mastermind): &quot;My condolences continue go to the Martin family.&quot; <BR> oKim Kardashian (@Kim Kardashian): &quot;My heart goes out to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family &amp; loved ones.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first comments since the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the Martin case, the attorney general said the 17-year-old's death provides an opportunity for the nation to speak honestly about complicated and emotionally charged issues. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wal-Mart, the nation's largest private employer, is fuming about a &quot;living wage&quot; bill approved by the D.C. Council that has an unusual twist - it would apply only to certain large retailers, forcing them to pay employees at least $12.50 an hour.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With prospects shaky for passing an immigration overhaul in the House, the White House insisted Monday that to garner Obama's signature, any bill must satisfy the president's principles - the path to citizenship chief among them.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second-degree murder, having pursued Martin, 17, through a gated community in the town of Sanford, eventually shooting him during an altercation on February 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial divided those who believed that Zimmerman, whose father is white and mother is Peruvian, had racially-profiled Martin and those who believed he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My head hurts - and it's not because of the Trayvon Martin verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, that verdict cleared up a few things. For the first time, I understand the NRA and America's affinity for guns. Packing a firearm is essential to survival, especially in a state like Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, I've told my sons that if they relocate to the U.S., they should, at the earliest possibility, acquire a gun and the authority to carry it at all times. Then, when an aggressor stands his ground, so can they. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's transit that has my head pounding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly three decades on the file leads one to despair. Little gets done without a confluence of cosmic political forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when they collide, there is much heat and sparks but little light and truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By some political fluke, the Scarborough subway debate has been resurrected. Last year, council voted for an LRT instead of the more costly subway to replace the Scarborough RT. (Mayor Rob Ford refused to apply property taxes to the project so council balked.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford threatened to campaign against the Scarborough councillors who didn't back his unfunded subway plan. Then when two councillors revived the subway optioned, Ford again voted against the subway because a property tax increase was required. The matter seemed dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then a number of unexpected and strange things happened. The provincial Liberals, who are funding the project, found themselves needing to win an Aug. 1 byelection in Scarborough. Polls show high support for a subway there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then city council voted on a funding plan for transit in the GTA and rejected everything but a sales tax hike. Tacked onto that vote was a motion to consider a subway instead of LRT. It passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provincial Liberals saw an opening to move some Scarborough votes into their harbour and soon Scarborough councillors with ties to the Liberal government were arguing for the very thing they rejected not long ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final unlikely alignment came last week when Mayor Ford, realizing he would again be offside on an issue that is his to win, politically, agreed to a property tax hike for a Scarborough subway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Ford caved on the matter of taxes to set up a political win Tuesday at council - one he will use to fuel his re-election campaign next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subway plan may yet crash, once the political imperatives change. Till then, consider this a phenomenon fed by chutzpah, demagoguery, political opportunism, cynical vote-buying, blatant flip-floppery and outright lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the pro-subway crowd burst into paroxysms of applause and delight. They've always wanted a subway. They're getting a subway - maybe - if the political winds don't change quickly, inevitably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transportation Minister Glen Murray met Ford at city hall Monday and emerged into a news conference where he barely stopped to inhale. He's waiting on city council to vote for a subway to replace the planned LRT. Only then will he address the mayor's demands for $1.8 billion, not $1.4 billion on the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he wants a solid business plan. And an economic impact study. And where are the plans to increase densities and employment in the corridor so the line will pay for itself? And why is the corridor, today, so unfriendly to transit users?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those questions betray a problem and &quot;huge challenge bigger than the subways versus LRT debate,&quot; Murray said. The corridor needs new zoning, more people and more jobs because nearly 30 years of the RT line has &quot;not changed much&quot; to make it economically viable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All good, Mr. Minister. Where were those questions and concerns when the LRT was approved? And watch them disappear as soon as the political deal is signed to move to subways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councillor Janet Davis spoke another truth yesterday. &quot;The people of Scarborough have been hijacked once again because there's an obsession in (the mayor's) office with putting trains underground,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is only a partial truth. It's also what Scarborough residents want - damn the facts, studies, ridership figures, higher costs, longer construction time, lies and unfair fears about LRTs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, we get the transit we believe in - even if we delay the transit we need.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - The acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch coordinator cleared of Florida charges that he murdered black 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, spurred new calls for a federal civil rights prosecution and suggestions that the youth's family may bring a lawsuit. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is pushing U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to pursue a hate crimes case against Zimmerman, its head said Monday on CNN's &quot;State of the Union.&quot; A Martin family lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said Martin's parents would investigate filing a lawsuit outside Sanford, Fla., where the criminal trial was held. &quot;There is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young Trayvon&quot; Ben Jealous, the NAACP president, said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know there will be a state phase, there will be a civil phase almost assuredly, and then there will be a civil rights phase.&quot; The Justice Department on Monday reiterated a March 19, 2012, statement that it was investigating the &quot;facts and circumstances&quot; surrounding the shooting, and will take &quot;appropriate action&quot; at the probe's conclusion. &quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial,&quot; the department said in an emailed statement. Holder called the killing a ''tragic, unnecessary shooting'' and said the Justice Department will follow ''the facts and the law'' as it reviews evidence to see whether federal criminal charges are warranted. ''I hope that we will approach this necessarily difficult dialogue with the same dignity that those who have lost the most, Trayvon's parents, have demonstrated throughout the last year - and especially the past few days,'' Holder said. &quot;They suffered a pain that no parent should have to endure - and one that I, as a father, cannot begin to conceive.'' Holder's comments came in a speech to the 51st national convention of the Delta Sigma Theta, the nation's largest African American sorority. In a wrongful-death action against Zimmerman, Martin's family would need to show he was culpable only by a preponderance of the evidence, according to Peter Grenier, a personal-injury lawyer at Bode &amp; Grenier LLP in Washington. The criminal case and acquittal, decided on the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt, would be irrelevant to the civil case under Florida law, Grenier said. O.J. Simpson, who was acquitted of murder in the stabbing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman, was ordered to pay $33.5 million after losing a wrongful-death trial. Florida is a comparative-fault state, meaning jurors would weigh both Martin's and Zimmerman's culpability. In Florida, wrongful-death suits claiming negligence must be filed within two years. There is no time limit for suits alleging intentional death. Most cases claim negligence so damages can be covered by the defendant's homeowner's insurance, Grenier said. Individuals found to be justified in using deadly force may be immune from civil liability under Florida law. If the family sues and loses, it might be ordered to pay attorneys' fees and compensation to defendants, according to state law. Zimmerman would have to establish immunity in a separate proceeding, Tamara F. Lawson, a professor at the St. Thomas University School of Law, said in a phone interview. &quot;In any potential subsequent civil case, the court would have to rule if he's entitled to civil immunity,&quot; she said. Kendall Coffey, a former U.S. attorney in Miami, Fla., said Martin's family can sue because Zimmerman didn't seek a hearing under the state's self-defense law before he was tried. President Barack Obama said Monday that &quot;we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot; It would be inappropriate for the president to express an opinion on how the Justice Department deals with Zimmerman, White House press secretary Jay Carney said. The six-woman jury on Saturday found Zimmerman, 29, not guilty of murder or the lesser crime of manslaughter for shooting Martin through the heart during a struggle at the townhouse complex where Martin was staying at the home of his father's girlfriend. Prosecutors alleged Zimmerman, whose father is white and mother is Hispanic, profiled Martin as a criminal suspect, then followed and confronted him, leading to the altercation in which the unarmed youth was killed. Defense lawyers argued that Zimmerman acted in self-defense, fearing for his life after Martin punched him in the face, knocked him to the ground and then pounded his head against the pavement. Other organizations calling for a Justice Department prosecution include MoveOn.org, which said in a statement yesterday it has joined the NAACP in collecting signatures on a petition to push for a federal investigation. More than 270,000 people have already signed it, the group said Monday. Zimmerman could get life in prison if charged and convicted under federal hate crime laws. The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, calling for Justice Department action, said the trial was &quot;characterized by racial overtones from the beginning.&quot; Bringing a civil rights case wouldn't be double jeopardy because it would be prosecuted by the U.S. under federal law, Christina Swarns, director of criminal justice at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said. Such cases after a state prosecution are rare, she said. The Associated Press contributed to this report. SUBHEAD: There are calls for federal civil rights charges, and many expect Martin's family to file a civil suit. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials are fast-tracking results of an autopsy performed on Cory Monteith, star of Fox's &quot;Glee,&quot; to determine his cause of death. The actor was found dead in his Vancouver, British Columbia, hotel room by a staffer Saturday after he missed his checkout time. Results of toxicology reports should be available in several days. The cause of death was not immediately apparent, and there is no suspicion of foul play, officials said in a press conference over the weekend. They also reported he was apparently alone in his room when he died and had been deceased for several hours when found. The 31-year-old Monteith, who shot to fame as popular high school quarterback Finn Hudson on the teen drama, reportedly spent time with friends Friday night and returned to his hotel room alone in the early Saturday. Representatives of his girlfriend, Lea Michele, who starred with the Canadian native in &quot;Glee,&quot; is asking &quot;that everyone kindly respect Lea's privacy during this devastating time,&quot; a class=&quot;ArticleLink&quot; href=&quot;http://cnn.com&quot; cnn.com reported.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She and Monteith had played an on-again off-again couple on the show since 2009 and started dating in 2012. In April, the actor admitted himself to a 30-day rehab program for substance abuse with her full support. &quot;I love and support Cory and will stand by him through this,&quot; she told People magazine. &quot;I am grateful and proud that he made this decision.&quot; Monteith told &quot;Glee&quot; producer Adam Shankman in a phone conversation Friday that he was &quot;feeling fantastic again.&quot; Production for the new season of his series was scheduled to begin in two weeks with the show returning for its fifth season on Sept. 19. Verdict draws viewers More than 11 million television viewers watched cable TV as the verdict was read in the George Zimmerman murder trial Saturday. He was found not guilty in the shooting death of unarmed, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. According to deadline.com, Fox News Channel had the highest number of viewers at 3.682 million when the verdict was announced at 9 p.m. Saturday. Welcome aboard, Jenny Barbara Walters announced Monday that actress Jenny McCarthy is officially co-hosting &quot;The View&quot; starting Sept. 9. div style=&quot;float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; width:151px; font-size:.9em; border-right: 1px dashed; border-bottom: 1px dashed;&quot; McCarthy /div McCarthy, who is also a comedian, host, blogger and best-selling author, has made 17 appearances on the show, eight as a guest co-host. &quot;We are delighted that Jenny will be joining us as a permanent co-host on 'The View' starting in September,&quot; Walters said in a press release. &quot;Jenny brings us intelligence as well as warmth and humor. She can be serious and outrageous. She has connected with our audience and offers a fresh point of view.&quot; McCarthy said, &quot;I look forward to helping make hot topics a little bit hotter and showing my mom that my interrupting skills have finally paid off.&quot; Co-hosts Joy Behar, whose contract is up in August, and Elisabeth Hasselbeck, who is headed to Fox News Channel, won't be on the show, and Walters plans to retire at the end of the year. Low 'Sharknado' ratings Syfy's &quot;Sharknado&quot; may have been all the buzz on social media, but the so-bad-it-was-good TV movie pulled in relatively low ratings numbers for the cable channel. &quot;Sharknado,&quot; which starred Ian Ziering and Tara Reid in a made-for-TV film about a superstorm that sucked sharks from the seas and dropped them into the streets of Los Angeles, drew 1.4 million viewers in its Thursday airing on cable, EW.com reported. In contrast, talk about the campy film and its trailer drew more tweets than the &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; Red Wedding episode. In comparison, Syfy's similarly themed films &quot;Sharktopus&quot; (2010) was watched by 2.5 million viewers, and &quot;Mega Python vs. Gatoroid,&quot; (2011) was seen by 2.4 million viewers in its initial showing, the website reported. &quot;Sharknado&quot; did, however, draw many more viewers in the coveted to 18-49 age bracket, up 29 percent from the cable channel's movie average this year. For those who missed it, Syfy will re-air the film at 6 p.m. Thursday on cable 45. The &quot;success&quot; of the film caused EW.com to update its list &quot;Syfy's 17 most awesomely bad horror movie titles,&quot; and &quot;Sharknado&quot; moved to the top of the list. The list includes, in order: &quot;Sharktopus,&quot; &quot;Piranhaconda,&quot; &quot;Mansquito,&quot; &quot;Never Cry Werewolf,&quot; &quot;Mongolian Death Worm,&quot; &quot;Kaw,&quot; &quot;Jersey Shore Shark Attack,&quot; &quot;Monster Ark,&quot; and &quot;Ice Spiders.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after George Zimmerman was found not guilty of second-degree murder or manslaughter in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, President Obama released a statement in which he said &quot;we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those words from America's first black President effectively marginalized any other black leader who might have urged riots or vigilante justice. Obama deserves credit for his call for respect and reflection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course he could not leave it at that. He had to politicize the trial -- again -- this time by connecting it to his push for gun control. Moreover, the U.S. Justice Department continues to pursue a possible civil rights case against Zimmerman, contradicting the President's admonition to respect the jury verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a tragic event that never should have happened. Zimmerman should have listened to the police. He is free because the state failed to prove its case against him beyond a reasonable doubt. Whether that is justice is a matter of debate, but it was the correct application of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuing a federal civil rights case against Zimmerman would further undermine trust in our justice system by making clear that jury trials are merely preliminary rounds in legal contests between parties of different racial backgrounds, and that the real final say is to be had in Washington by whichever party has friends in the administration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long before a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon Martin, I'd given up on justice prevailing in this case. I was pessimistic even though the facts seemed clear: the armed, wannabe cop pursued the 17-year-old boy through the dark streets of a Sanford, Fla., neighborhood over the objection of a 911 operator because he believed the boy was one of those &quot;punks&quot; who &quot;always get away&quot; with a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, a white Hispanic who had a gun the night of his deadly encounter with the black teen, had Florida law --and the suppressed issue of race -- on his side. The state's self-defense statute favored this gun-toting man who pursued the frightened youngster. That law became Zimmerman's get-out-of-jail-free ticket the moment his lawyers argued their client shot Martin because he was losing a fistfight his actions precipitated. Justice makes no concession to such a whiplash notion of self-defense. But Florida law and this case's racial subplot did. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forgotten facts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget that Zimmerman wrongly profiled Martin as a boy up to no good as Martin made his way toward the house where  he was staying. Forget that Martin was armed with only a bag of Skittles and a can of iced tea while Zimmerman was packing a 9-mm handgun. Forget that Zimmerman got out of his SUV for no good reason and minutes later was in a fistfight with Martin. The judge told the jurors they could set Zimmerman free if they believed he feared for his life when the black youngster he pursued got the better of him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, in what seems a winning argument, Zimmerman's team accused Martin of being responsible for his own death because he didn't retreat when he had the chance. &quot;The person who decided that this was going to continue, was going to become a violent event, was the guy who didn't go home when he had the chance to. It was the guy who decided to lie in wait,&quot; defense attorney Mark O'Mara said in his closing argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time to get away?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin had four minutes to run away, O'Mara said. Instead, the defense attorney claimed, the boy lay in wait and jumped Zimmerman when he walked by his hiding place. This is where justice  took its worst beating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was Zimmerman doing in those four minutes?  Why didn't he get back into his car and drive off?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A juror in the George Zimmerman trial said Monday that the neighborhood watch volunteer never should have gotten out of his car the night last year when he shot and killed young Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first juror interview since Zimmerman was acquitted Saturday night, the juror also said the initial division among the six-woman panel when they began deliberating was three for acquittal, one for second-degree murder and two for manslaughter. As they reviewed the evidence, the jurors came to believe Zimmerman, 29, truly feared for his life when he pulled the trigger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror, who was not identified but known as B-37, was one of the three initially for acquittal. She is planning to write a book about the trial. She told CNN she wanted to remain &quot;cautious&quot; and that is why she didn't want her face shown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Zimmerman was &quot;a man whose heart was in the right place,&quot; but he went too far and did not use good judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that Zimmerman did have the right to carry his pistol. &quot;I think it's everyone's right to carry a gun&quot; as long as they use it responsibly, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror said she thought Trayvon, 17, threw the first punch, and she believed Zimmerman's recount of what happened that night. &quot;I think George was pretty consistent and told the truth basically,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also said she didn't think the attack was racially motivated. Instead, Zimmerman simply thought of Trayvon as a suspicious character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the laws they had to consider were &quot;very confusing,&quot; so they took their time to think through it all carefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, after they gave the bailiff their decision, they cried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was just hard thinking that someone had lost their life and nothing else could be done about it,&quot; she told CNN. &quot;It's a tragedy that this happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile in Washington, Attorney General Eric Holder called Trayvon's death &quot;unnecessary&quot; and vowed to proceed with a civil rights inquiry after Zimmerman's acquittal on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder told a convention of the nation's largest black sorority that the federal government is &quot;determined to meet division and confusion with understanding and compassion -- and also with truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Justice Department shares your concern. I share your concern,&quot; he told Delta Sigma Theta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised,&quot; Holder said. <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of George Zimmerman on second-degree murder in the shooting of Trayvon Martin has sent the U.S. into another round of angry debate over race and the law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida jury accepted that Zimmerman acted in self-defence but some African-Americans and their supporters see racism in the decision - that the case flows from a fear of young black men and a gun culture too quick to allow deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the racial elements of the case are less of an issue in Canada, confusion around what constitutes legal self-defence has been a problem. It's why the Conservatives brought in legislation that took effect in March to clarify when, and to what extent, citizens can use force to protect themselves, others and property. The Citizen's Arrest and Self-defence Act amended the self-defence sections of the Criminal Code, which were so confusing that judges had trouble explaining them to juries, leading to appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new simplified &quot;defence of the person&quot; has three key elements: a person reasonably believes that force is being used against them or another person or is threatened; that the act of self-defence is committed for the purpose of defending or protecting themselves or the other person; and that their act committed is reasonable in the circumstances. It lists nine &quot;factors&quot; for lawyers, juries and judges to consider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new act also allows reasonable steps to protect property. It will still be up to the Crown, in whether to lay charges, and the courts, in whether to convict, to determine reasonable force, but the intent of the law is now more clear, which is a good thing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moment neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old white Latino, shot black teenager Trayvon Martin dead in February 2012 as Martin walked to his father's home in Sanford, Fla., race and politics took centre stage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing reverberated throughout the nation's black communities, whose members know only too well the harsh reality of racial profiling and that the justice system is rife with racial bias, as many studies have shown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these two ingredients were mixed into the judicial process, two other elements in the case retreated into the shadows. Those ingredients, however, would prove pivotal: gun control and Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, plus its related statutes on self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essentially, Zimmerman was able to shoot Martin because Florida law - and the law in most states - permits him to carry a concealed weapon and gives him the right to use that weapon to defend himself against grave bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem, however, is people can get it wrong. They can misinterpret the danger. Luckily for these shooters, the law also protects against that eventuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chaos of such defensiveforce situations means that people commonly make mistakes,&quot; Paul Robinson, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal. &quot;The law does not require that a person get it exactly right. It may be enough that the person honestly believed his force was necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman said he followed Martin because he thought he was a robber. When an angry Martin turned on him and began beating him up, Zimmerman shot him in self-defence. That's his story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police declared the shooting was indeed selfdefence, civil rights activists organized mass protests. The dark hoodie Martin wore that fateful night became a civil rights emblem. Federal and state politicians met with prosecutors and urged Zimmerman's arrest and prosecution. The killing was hashed out in America's newsrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Justice Department sent FBI investigators to gather evidence for possible prosecution of Zimmerman for federal civil rights violations. No case was filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was charged about two months after the shooting with second-degree murder. (The prosecutor would, at the end of the trial, add the charge of manslaughter as a fallback in case the jury didn't accept the harsher allegation.) After a jury of six women - five white and one Hispanic - on Saturday found him not guilty of either charge, protests swept the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerned about possible violence, akin to the riots that inflamed the streets of Los Angeles following the acquittal of the policemen who beat Rodney King in 1991, U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement, saying: &quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions. And after the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis,&quot; he later added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP produced a petition with 450,000 names urging the justice department to reopen a civil rights investigation against Zimmerman, claiming he killed Martin because he was black. The justice department agreed to reopen the file. Meanwhile, Zimmerman has the right to get his gun back.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- More than 3,000 miles and 36 hours removed from the verdict that set off weekend protests marred by violence and vandalism, Oakland's battered downtown cleaned up on Monday, with merchants boarding up windows and city workers washing trashed streets and storefronts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida acquittal of George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who shot and killed Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager, prompted mostly peaceful weekend protests in San Jose, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, however -- the city where Oscar Grant was shot and killed by a BART police officer and where the Oakland Police Department is under federal supervision in part over a failure to stop racial profiling -- nightfall led to rowdy, chaotic protests that, in a few instances, turned violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A loosely organized protest of about 150 people late Saturday night resulted in widespread vandalism, and a few protesters beat one man in a Broadway doorway near Frank H. Ogawa Plaza until other protesters ended the skirmish. The man was helped to his feet and did not appear seriously injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group shattered numerous storefront windows, spray-painted buildings and a police car, and started several small fires in the streets. No arrests were reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's demonstration began peacefully with a two-hour afternoon march from downtown to West Oakland and back, ending with protesters sitting in the intersection of 14th Street and Broadway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours later, a small group of protesters started heading north on Telegraph Avenue and quickly turned violent, attacking a KTVU photographer and a Bay Area News Group photographer who suffered minor injuries when he was kicked on the ground and his camera was ripped from his shoulder. Police made only one arrest, of someone who refused to disperse and did not have identification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses along Telegraph Avenue and Broadway took the brunt of the damage, with 61 windows broken or shattered at 14 buildings, according to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interim Police Chief Sean Whent, who surveyed the damage on Monday afternoon, said his department was not aware jurors in the Zimmerman trial were deliberating over the weekend, so it had only eight to 10 officers immediately available on Saturday to police an increasingly unruly crowd of about 150 protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked if he was happy about the staffing level, Whent said: &quot;No, not at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interim chief said his department is reviewing surveillance footage in an attempt to make additional arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, duct tape was holding together windows at Awaken Cafe on Broadway. A flier was taped next to it: &quot;This window will be fixed later today. When will the U.S. justice system?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the 1400 block of Broadway, which has been hit hard by vandalism during protests over the years, all six ground floor windows were boarded up at Foot Locker, and a few doors down, four windows were damaged at the Oaklandish store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vandalism was a first for Oaklandish, which opened on Broadway in July 2011. The store sells Oakland-themed apparel and donates a portion of its proceeds to local community organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't necessarily think it was targeted but who's to say,&quot; said Natalie Nadimi, the company's community engagement manager. &quot;I don't know if there's any rhyme or reason to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oaklandish has no plans to move from the heart of downtown, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We really represent what Oakland is about and where it's going,&quot; said Nadimi. &quot;There's no question we are going to stay here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 60 people were inside Dogwood, an Uptown bar, on Saturday night when protesters smashed the front windows using bicycle u-locks, said owner Alexeis Filipello. Employees guarded the front of the store, and were &quot;physically pushing them away,&quot; Filipello said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 45 minutes later, Oakland police arrived. She said she went out seeking assistance and warned officers about a group of approximately 50 people burning trash cans on the 17th Street side of the bar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically the police officer said, 'There's nothing I can do and I don't care,'&quot; Filipello said. &quot;It was such a 'not-our-problem.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When is enough, enough?&quot; she asked. &quot;How are we supposed to get help?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bar reopened Monday at 4 p.m. As for the protest planned Monday evening in Oakland? &quot;We'll just see what happens,&quot; Filipello said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI - A juror in the George Zimmerman trial said Monday that the panel was initially split, with three votes for not guilty, two for manslaughter and one for second-degree murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a couple of them in there that wanted to find him guilty of something. And after hours and hours and hours of deliberating over the law, and reading it over and over and over again, we just decided there's no other way or place to go,&quot; she told CNN's Anderson Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman known as Juror B37 said the actions of Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, and Trayvon Martin both led to the teenager's fatal shooting last year but that Zimmerman did not break the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that Zimmerman made some poor decisions leading up to the shooting but that Martin wasn't innocent, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into,&quot; said the juror, who is planning to write a book about the trial. &quot;I think they both could have walked away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror said Detective Chris Serino of the Sanford, Fla., police made a big impression on her, because he would have been accustomed to dealing with murders and similar cases. He would have known how to spot a liar, and yet he said he believed Zimmerman, the juror said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal analysts agreed that Serino's testimony was a blow to the state's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror was not impressed by the testimony of Rachel Jeantel, who was talking with Martin by cellphone moments before he was fatally shot by Zimmerman in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't think it was very credible, but I felt very sorry for her,&quot; the juror said. &quot;She didn't want to be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't like what George Zimmerman did, and I hate that Trayvon Martin is dead. But I also can understand why Zimmerman was suspicious and why he thought Martin was wearing a uniform we all recognize. I don't know whether Zimmerman is a racist. But I'm tired of politicians and others who have donned hoodies in solidarity with Martin and who essentially suggest that, for recognizing the reality of urban crime in the United States, I am a racist . The hoodie blinds them as much as it did Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those who quickly donned a hoodie was Christine Quinn, the speaker of the New York City Council. Quinn was hardly a lonesome panderer. Lesser politicians joined her and, as she did, pronounced Zimmerman a criminal. &quot;What George Zimmerman did was wrong, was a crime,&quot; Quinn said before knowing all of the facts and before the jury uncooperatively  found otherwise. She was half-right. What Zimmerman did was wrong. It was not, by verdict of his peers, a crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where is the politician who will own up to the painful complexity of the problem and acknowledge the widespread fear of crime committed by young black males? This does not mean that raw racism has disappeared, and some judgments are not the product of invidious stereotyping. It does mean, though, that the public knows young black males commit a disproportionate amount of crime. In New York City, blacks make up a quarter of the population, yet they represent 78 percent of all shooting suspects - almost all of them young men. We know them from the nightly news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those statistics represent the justification for New York City's controversial stop-and-frisk program, which amounts to racial profiling writ large. After all, if young black males are your shooters, then it ought to be young black males whom the police stop and frisk. Still, common sense and common decency, not to mention the law, insist on other variables such as suspicious behavior. Even still, race is a factor, without a doubt. It would be senseless for the police to be stopping Danish tourists in Times Square just to make the statistics look good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish I had a solution to this problem. If I were a young black male and were stopped just on account of my appearance, I would feel violated. If the police are abusing their authority and using race as the only reason, that has got to stop. But if they ignore race, then they are fools and ought to go into another line of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problems of the black underclass are hardly new. They are surely the product of slavery, the subsequent Jim Crow era and the tenacious persistence of racism. They will be solved someday, but not probably with any existing programs. For want of a better word, the problem is cultural, and it will be solved when the culture, somehow, is changed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, the least we can do is talk honestly about the problem. It does no one any good to merely cite the number of stop-and-frisks involving black males without citing the murder statistics as well. Citing the former and not the latter is an Orwellian exercise in political correctness. It not only censors half of the story but also suggests that racism is the sole reason for the policy. This mindlessness, like racism itself, is repugnant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime where it intersects with race is given the silent treatment. Everything else is discussed - and if it isn't, there's a Dr. Phil or an Oprah saying that it should be. Crime, though, is different. It is, like sex in the Victorian era (or the 1950s), an unmentionable but unmistakable part of life. We all know about it and take appropriate precaution but keep our mouths shut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one time, I thought Barack Obama would bring the problem into the open and remove the racist stigma. Instead, he perpetuated it. In his acclaimed Philadelphia speech on race, he cited his grandmother as &quot;a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her by on the street.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How about the former Barry Obama? When he was a Columbia University student living on the lip of then-dangerous Harlem, did he never have the same fear?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no doubt in my mind that Zimmerman profiled Martin and, braced by a gun, set off in quest of heroism. The result was a quintessentially American tragedy - the death of a young man understandably suspected because he was black and tragically dead for the same reason. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Florida towns, 125 miles apart. Two people firing weapons at unarmed aggressors, purportedly in self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, the 29-year-old neighborhood-watch commander, fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin but was acquitted by a jury that apparently concluded he was in fear for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marissa Alexander, a 32-year-old mother of three, fired what she described as a warning shot in the direction of her husband - against whom she had a protective order - and two stepsons. No one was injured, but she was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 20 years.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the Zimmerman trial and the national debate on race and justice that it prompted, Alexander's case - from 2010 - has drawn renewed attention, including an online petition seeking a pardon from Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) that has generated more than 36,000 signatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters say Alexander, who is African American, was a victim of ingrained racism in Florida's courts. Some say that those same alleged prejudices allowed Zimmerman, who has a white father and a Peruvian mother, to walk free after killing Martin, who was black. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Angela Corey, the state attorney who prosecuted Alexander and oversaw the Zimmerman case, says there were &quot;zero parallels.&quot; The facts surrounding Alexander's conviction, she adds, are more complex than the Twitter-fueled pardon campaign makes it appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think social media is going to be the destruction of this country,&quot; Corey said. &quot;How dare people just repeat something without checking it's true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander was convicted of three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for firing a gun into a wall close to where her husband, Rico Gray, and stepsons were standing, after she and Gray had a dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When questioned by police, Alexander said she discharged the weapon to avoid being beaten by Gray, who was subject to an injunction prohibiting violent contact with her. Alexander, who had given birth to Gray's child nine days earlier, said she had no intention of killing him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judge rejected her bid to mount a defense under Florida's controversial &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which allows people to use deadly force if they or their homes are in danger. After she rejected a three-year plea deal, Alexander was convicted and sentenced to 20 years, as required by Florida's strict sentencing guidelines on crimes involving a gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Cobbin, Alexander's attorney, said his client was justified in firing her gun because Gray &quot;had put his hands on her and there was a fight in the bathroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The judge decided not to make the call to grant 'stand your ground,' &quot; Cobbin said. &quot;If it had been a white female, I believe she would have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.), whose district includes parts of Jacksonville, last year described Alexander's case as evidence of &quot;institutional racism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Corey said there are other, less widely shared details that paint a different picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Gray's sons were pulling on their shoes to leave the house when Alexander raised her weapon to fire - in other words, they and their father were about to leave. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While online accounts sympathetic to Alexander say she fired shots into the ceiling, the single bullet she fired actually hit the wall, not far from Gray and the boys, then ricocheted into the ceiling, Corey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey also points out a later incident when Alexander, while free on bail and awaiting trial, became involved in an altercation with Gray that left him with a swollen eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She put a round in the chamber, and she fired that shot out of anger, not fear,&quot; Corey said. &quot;She didn't need to use that gun. Those kids were scared to death. They ran for their lives.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bill Baxley assumed office as Alabama attorney general in 1971, he was determined to bring to justice the bombers who lit the dynamite beneath the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, killing four little black girls Sept. 15, 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A state jury had refused to convict one of the men, Robert Chambliss, on murder charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in 1976, Baxley reopened the case and eventually got a murder conviction for Chambliss, who died in prison. Many across the South believed that with the guilty verdict, Southern juries - once defiantly loath to convict whites for the murder of blacks - had begun a judicial trek toward fairness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the acquittal this weekend of George Zimmerman, who fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, those feelings, especially among many blacks, were upended. A jury of six women - five whites and one described as a white Hispanic - found the neighborhood watch volunteer, who said he shot the unarmed Martin in self-defense, not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. The jury deliberated more than 16 hours after a three-week trial in Sanford, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Southern jury - when it comes to race and the perception that a black person has been wrongly accused or harmed - operates under the wide, whispering shadow of history. And there exists a roster of names and cases that has exploded onto the national scene and claimed headlines against this backdrop of race and geography: the Scottsboro Boys, Emmett Till, Isaac Woodward, Medgar Evers, the four girls killed in the Alabama bombing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Zimmerman verdict, civil rights activists have clamored for charges of federal civil rights violations. President Obama referred to Martin's death as &quot;a tragedy.&quot; On Monday, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. called the teenager's death &quot;unnecessary&quot; and said the Justice Department would continue its investigation of the shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case, fairly or not, has reignited passions about the South and Southern juries when it comes to justice for blacks. It is a story line so often mentioned that it is now wedded to popular culture, in literature - the works of Eudora Welty, William Faulkner and Ralph Ellison - as well as in movies. In &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; a black man wrongly accused of raping a white woman is convicted despite the defense waged by his heroic white attorney. FBI agents in &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; seek justice for three voting- rights activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baxley began working as a lawyer in Alabama at the height of the civil rights movement, when blacks were routinely tossed in jail for protesting. &quot;When I started practicing,&quot; Baxley says, &quot;there were no women on juries. And very few blacks, if any.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baxley acknowledges, in light of the Zimmerman verdict, that Southern juries may have to constantly fight to overcome history and the perception that they cannot mete out justice when it comes to blacks who have been wronged. &quot;It requires evolution,&quot; he says of certain juries. &quot;And evolution is slow. There are ingrained attitudes, and some of those are based on fear.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Baxley, who is white, believes that the South has made appreciable advances when it comes to courtroom justice and must be viewed in terms of history. &quot;It's a vast difference from what it used to be,&quot; he says. &quot;I remember the 1960s in Alabama. Sometimes you would have a confession by whites who had done violence against blacks. And the jury would still come back with acquittals! Sometimes the police would do a great job, but the jury would turn them loose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he understands the strong emotions in the Martin case but argues that the prosecution had a high hurdle. &quot;I think this case would have been hard to win in any state,&quot; he says. &quot;I think it was just difficult for the prosecution. You did have a guy [Zimmerman] with some kind of injuries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that there were still culprits loose in the Birmingham church bombing after Chambliss had been sent to prison was not lost on Doug Jones, who as a U.S. attorney in Alabama, brought and won convictions against two others, Tommy Blanton in 2001 and Bobby Frank Cherry in 2002. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones, who is white, says that he believes there is a racial dynamic to the Martin killing but that the jury was in a difficult position. &quot;I believe Zimmerman racially profiled Martin,&quot; he says. &quot;We know there was an altercation. So I think there are intervening factors here that the jury had to look at.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clifford Alexander, who is black, was a young lawyer when he worked in the White House under President Lyndon B. Johnson. He well remembers discussions about judges and juries in Southern courtrooms in those days. And he understands why conversations reverted to such reflections in the aftermath of the Zimmerman verdict. &quot;The clear reason why Zimmerman had the audacity to approach this child was that he saw the color of his skin as a threat,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says it was particularly galling that after Martin was killed, there was no immediate arrest, which only hardened sentiments about Southern law enforcement. &quot;We all know Zimmerman wasn't arrested until later. And you had a dead young man right there!&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander, who went on to head the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, said the Martin verdict and other actions by law enforcement, such as New York City's stop-and-frisk policy,  leave blacks with impressions of unfair treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jurors in the past often were not treating black life like they would a white life. There are still, today, too many differentials in treatment,&quot; he said. &quot;We have been, as a society - and often as a government - unable to describe the racism of certain things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was 1963 when Welty, a white writer in the South, sought to describe racism in a short story, &quot;Where Is the Voice Coming From?&quot; Revered as one of this country's most gifted writers, she did not regularly write about race and crime in her native South. But Evers's killing so affected her that she sat down at her typewriter and, according to legend, wrote the five-page story in one day. Her story was a fictionalized portrait of the night Evers was murdered in the driveway of his Jackson, Miss., home. The narrator is the gunman. &quot;Something darker than him, like the wings of a bird, spread on his back and pulled him down. He climbed up once, like a man under bad claws, and like just blood could weigh a ton he walked with it on his back to better light. Didn't get no further than his door. And fell to stay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evers's real-life killer, Byron De La Beckwith, was tried twice in 1964, each time resulting in hung juries. Thirty years later, in 1994, after new evidence was uncovered, a jury of eight blacks and four whites found him guilty of first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current and former Justice Department officials said Monday that bringing civil rights charges against George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old in Florida, would be extremely difficult and may not be possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. vowed to continue a federal investigation of the matter, but other officials said in interviews that the government may not be able to charge Zimmerman with a federal hate crime because it's not clear that he killed Martin because of his race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weakness of the evidence compounds the political problems facing President Obama and Holder, who are under mounting pressure from many liberal and African American groups to bring a federal case against Zimmerman after a Florida jury acquitted him Saturday of second-degree murder and manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has responded cautiously to the national uproar, making no public comments other than a carefully worded statement Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Holder is acting as the administration's spokesman on the matter, saying in a speech Monday that Martin's killing was a &quot;tragic, unnecessary shooting death.&quot; At a previously scheduled luncheon celebrating the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, a large audience of black women broke into applause when Holder said, &quot;I share your concern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are determined to meet division and confusion with understanding and compassion - and also with truth,&quot; Holder said, adding: &quot;We will never stop working to ensure that - in every case, in every circumstance and in every community - justice must be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Department lawyers are reviewing an investigation of Martin's shooting begun last year in conjunction with the FBI and state prosecutors in Florida, officials said. Prosecutors are combing through that evidence, as well as testimony from Zimmerman's state trial, to determine whether to file civil rights charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Justice couldn't bring this case unless they believe they could prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that George Zimmerman killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because of his race,&quot; said Rachel Harmon, a law professor at the University of Virginia and a former prosecutor in the Justice Department's civil rights division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not enough to show that Zimmerman followed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because of his race,&quot; Harmon added. &quot;They would have to show that he attacked Martin for that reason. . . . Proving that motive is why it's hard to bring hate crime charges in general and why it is likely to be hard to bring them in this case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately, several Justice Department officials agreed that such charges would be  difficult to bring for several reasons, including the difficulty in proving motive and the challenge posed by Zimmerman's acquittal in state court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further complicating any federal case against Zimmerman are FBI interviews last year suggesting that racial bias was not a motivating factor in the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida officials released documents last year based on interviews with Zimmerman's ex-fiancee, neighbors, friends and co-workers, as well as with police investigator Christopher Serino in Sanford, Fla., the lead detective in the case. Serino said he thought Zimmerman followed Martin because of his attire, not his skin color. He told the FBI he thought Zimmerman had a &quot;little hero complex&quot; but did not believe he was a racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury in Florida acquitted Zimmerman after his attorneys used a self-defense argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, a neighborhood watchman, saw Martin walking through his gated community on a rainy night in February 2012 and followed him. Zimmerman said he shot Martin after the teenager punched him, knocked him down and started pounding his head into a concrete walkway. Prosecutors said Zimmerman racially profiled Martin and initiated the confrontation that resulted in the teenager's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict brought protests from civil rights organizations and demands for federal action. Among those calling on the Justice Department to become involved were three black Democratic congressmen from New York: Charles B. Rangel, Hakeem Jeffries and Gregory W. Meeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP started a petition late Saturday to urge the department to file civil rights charges against Zimmerman. The petition received such a massive response that it crashed the organization's Web site. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, the nation's first African American president, has often struggled to find his footing in confronting sensitive issues of race. And Holder, the nation's first black attorney general, increasingly has become Obama's voice on controversial racial issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder is a liaison to black advocacy organizations and pushes an aggressive civil rights agenda, at times providing the White House cover when Obama chooses not to get involved. On Tuesday, Holder will address the NAACP's annual convention in Orlando, not far from Sanford, where the trial was held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joshua DuBois, a former White House adviser to Obama on spiritual issues, said the president tends to engage on sensitive matters such as the Martin case only if he thinks his leadership can help the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He runs these things through a couple filters - one, will it on balance bring more healing than division, and two, will it accomplish a specific policy objective,&quot; DuBois said. &quot;The activist community, their job is to want more, to be the voice of the voiceless. But the role of the president is to bring the country together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, Obama inserted himself into the controversy surrounding Martin's death by making a personal appeal to the teenager's parents and parents everywhere. &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; the president said from the Rose Garden. &quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, after Zimmerman's acquittal, Obama issued a similar appeal. He said Martin's death was &quot;a tragedy&quot; for the family and for the country. But, he added, &quot;we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot; He urged calm and summoned Americans to &quot;widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the White House on Monday, press secretary Jay Carney said Obama &quot;has no opinion to express&quot; about the Justice Department investigation or whether federal charges should be brought against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cases are brought on the merits, and the merits are evaluated by the professionals at the Department of Justice,&quot; Carney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some civil rights leaders said Obama was responding appropriately to keep from unduly influencing a Justice Department investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My heart would love to see him charge the barricade,&quot; the Rev. Al Sharpton, an activist and television host, said in an interview. &quot;My mind tells me that would give us a moment of joy and a longevity of pain because it would undermine the potential merits of a federal case.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice failed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin the night he was killed. We should be appalled and outraged, but perhaps not surprised, that it failed him again Saturday night, with a verdict setting his killer free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our society considers young black men to be dangerous, interchangeable, expendable, guilty until proven innocent. This is the conversation about race that we desperately need to have - but probably, as in the past, will try our best to avoid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's acquittal was set in motion on Feb. 26, 2012, before Martin's body was cold. When Sanford, Fla., police arrived on the scene, they encountered a grown man who acknowledged killing an unarmed 17-year-old boy. They did not arrest the man or test him for drug or alcohol use. They conducted a less-than-energetic search for forensic evidence. They hardly bothered to look for witnesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a national outcry forced authorities to investigate the killing seriously. Even after six weeks, evidence was found to justify arresting Zimmerman, charging him with second-degree murder and putting him on trial. But the chance of dispassionately and definitively establishing what happened that night was probably lost. The only complete narrative of what transpired was Zimmerman's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors knew that Zimmerman was an overeager would-be cop, a self-appointed guardian of the neighborhood who carried a loaded gun. They were told that he profiled Martin - young, black, hooded sweatshirt - as a criminal. They heard that he stalked Martin despite the advice of a 911 operator; that the stalking led to a confrontation; and that, in the confrontation, Zimmerman fatally shot Martin in the chest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors also knew that Martin was carrying only a bag of candy and a soft drink. They knew that Martin was walking from a 7-Eleven to the home of his father's girlfriend when he noticed a strange man in an SUV following him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To me, and to many who watched the trial, the fact that Zimmerman recklessly initiated the tragic encounter was enough to establish, at a minimum, guilt of manslaughter. The six women on the jury disagreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those jurors also knew that Martin, at the time of his death, was just three weeks past his 17th birthday. But black boys in this country are not allowed to be children. They are assumed to be men, and to be full of menace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know if the jury, which included no African Americans, consciously or unconsciously bought into this racist way of thinking - there's really no other word. But it hardly matters, because police and prosecutors initially did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assumption underlying their ho-hum approach to the case was that Zimmerman had the right to self-defense, but Martin - young, male, black - did not. The assumption was that Zimmerman would fear for his life in a hand-to-hand struggle, but Martin - young, male, black - would not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anyone wonders why African Americans feel so passionately about this case, it's because we know that our 17-year-old sons are boys, not men. It's because we know their adolescent bravura is just that - an imitation of manhood, not the real thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know how frightened our sons would be, walking home alone on a rainy night and realizing they were being followed. We know how torn they would be between a child's fear and a child's immature idea of manly behavior. We know how they would struggle to decide the right course of action, flight or fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we know that a skinny boy armed only with candy, no matter how big and bad he tries to seem, does not pose a mortal threat to a healthy adult man who outweighs him by 50 pounds and has had martial arts training (even if the lessons were mostly a waste of money). We know that the boy may well have threatened the man's pride but likely not his life. How many murders-by-sidewalk have you heard of recently? Or ever? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation we need to have is about how black men, even black boys, are denied the right to be young, to be vulnerable, to make mistakes. We need to talk about why, for example, black men are no more likely than white men to smoke marijuana but nearly four times as likely to be arrested for it - and condemned to a dead-end cycle of incarceration and unemployment. I call this racism. What do you call it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was fighting more than George Zimmerman that night. He was up against prejudices as old as American history, and he never had a chance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House says President Barack Obama will not involve himself in decisions by the Justice Department on whether to pursue civil rights charges against George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesperson Jay Carney says it would be inappropriate for Obama to express an opinion on how the department deals with Zimmerman after the neighbourhood watch volunteer's acquittal in the shooting of the unarmed 17-year-old last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of Saturday's verdict have called for the Justice Department to step in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department has said it is investigating whether federal criminal civil rights charges are warranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carney would not comment on Obama's view of Florida's &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; law, which gives people wide latitude to use deadly force if they fear death or bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, just two days after George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a book agent Monday confirmed that one of the jurors who reached that verdict plans to write a book about the high-profile trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Literary and media manager Sharlene Martin said she has signed the juror, publicly known only as B-37, the designation she was given in jury selection, and her husband to write a book describing her experience as a juror and explaining the controversial verdict she and the five other jurors reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My hope is that people will read Juror B37's book, written with her attorney husband, and understand the commitment it takes to serve and be sequestered on a jury in a highly publicized murder trial and how important, despite one's personal viewpoints, it is to follow the letter of the law,&quot; Martin said in a statement. &quot;It could open a whole new dialogue about laws that may need to be revised and revamped to suit a 21st century way of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reader will also learn why the jurors had no option but to find Zimmerman not guilty due to the manner in which he was charged and the content of the jury instructions,&quot; the statement says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-member jury panel deliberated about 16 hours before returning a not-guilty verdict. Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder, and jurors were also allowed to consider manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OUTRAGE over the acquittal of George Zimmerman over the shooting of an unarmed black teenager poured from street demonstrations and church pulpits as protesters called for justice for the victim. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's killing unleashed a national debate over racial profiling, self-defence and equal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York City, hundreds of protesters marched into Times Square last night, zigzagging through the streets to avoid police lines. Sign-carrying marchers thronged the busy intersection, chanting: &quot;Justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin!&quot; George Zimmerman may still face charges over the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, despite being acquitted of his murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US neighbourhood watch volunteer is now a free man, but the US Justice Department said it is looking into Mr Martin's death to decide whether federal prosecutors will file criminal civil rights charges against Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama and numerous celebrities expressed sorrow at the verdict, which has led to largely peaceful protests across the country by civil rights leaders and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The February 2012 shooting first drew national attention when Mr Zimmerman was not arrested for weeks, and the case has continued to raise questions over race and self-defence gun laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late on Saturday night a jury found 29-year-old Mr Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and declined to convict him on a lesser charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In San Francisco and Los Angeles police closed streets as protesters marched to condemn Mr Zimmerman's acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours after the verdict, demonstrators gathered in Washington chanting, &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot; One protester carried a sign that read: &quot;Stop criminalizing black men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders, including Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, urged peace in the wake of the verdict. The Rev Jackson said the legal system &quot;failed justice,&quot; but that violence is not the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most protests were peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the verdict may be legal, a system that doesn't take into account what happened is a broken legal system,&quot; said Jennifer Lue, 24, an Asian-American resident of New York. &quot;Everyone should feel about this, whether you're Asian-American or African-American.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in cities across America as black community leaders demanded authorities pursue a federal civil rights case against George Zimmerman, who shot dead an unarmed teenager - Trayvon&nbsp;Martin - but was acquitted of the teenager's murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrations have erupted in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, where hundreds of protesters marched on Times Square. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marchers carried signs and chanted &quot;Justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin!&quot; and &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; as tourists looked on. Beyonc&eacute; called for a moment of silence for Martin during a concert in Nashville, Tennessee, while rapper Young Jeezy released a song in Martin's memory. Protests have been relatively small in scale so far, easing fears that violent unrest would follow the widespread outrage over the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House has said President Barack Obama will not involve himself in decisions by the American Justice Department on whether to pursue civil rights charges against Zimmerman over the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesman Jay Carney said it would be inappropriate for Obama to express an opinion on how the department deals with Zimmerman after the neighborhood watch volunteer's acquittal in the shooting of the unarmed 17-year-old last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department has said it is considering whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman has been acquitted in the state case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of Saturday's verdict have called for the Justice Department to step in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The February 2012 shooting first drew national attention when Mr Zimmerman was not arrested for weeks, and the case has continued to raise questions over race and selfdefence gun laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late on Saturday night a jury found 29-year-old Mr Zimmerman not guilty of seconddegree murder and declined to convict him on a lesser charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman has said he shot the 17-year-old in self-defence in a nighttime confrontation in his Florida gated community, where Mr Martin was visiting his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors were told that Mr Zimmerman was allowed to use deadly force when he shot the teenager not only if he actually faced death or bodily harm, but also if he merely thought he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With many critics angry over Mr Zimmerman's acquittal, his freedom may be limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He may also face civil lawsuits from Mr Martin's family. &quot;He's going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,&quot; his brother, Robert Zimmerman told CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama called Mr Martin's death a tragedy for America but asked that everyone respects calls for calm reflection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a rare statement from the president on a case that does not directly involve the federal government. &quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions,&quot; the president said. &quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More protests have been planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many, including Mr Martin's parents, said Mr Zimmerman had racially profiled the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, whose mother was born in Peru, iden-tifies as Hispanic. Despite the racially charged nature of the case, race was barely mentioned at the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Martin's family has maintained the teenager was not the aggressor, and prosecutors suggested Mr Martin was scared because he was being followed by a stranger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However defence lawyers said Mr Martin knocked Mr Zimmerman down and was slamming the older man's head against the pavement when Mr Zimmerman fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors portrayed Mr Zimmerman as a vigilante who had grown frustrated by breakins in his neighbourhood committed primarily by young black men. Mr Zimmerman assumed Mr Martin was up to no good, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department opened an investigation into Mr Martin's death last year but stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the department said the criminal section of its civil rights division, the FBI and the local US Attorney's office are continuing to evaluate the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department has a long history of using federal civil rights law in an effort to convict defendants who have previously been acquitted in related state cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But experience has shown it is never easy getting convictions in such high-profile prosecutions. Alan Vinegrad, a former US Attorney, said federal prosecutors &quot;would have to show not only that the attack was unjustified, but that Mr Zimmerman attacked Mr Martin because of his race and because he was using a public facility, the street&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court did not release the racial and ethnic make-up of the six-person jury, but the panel appeared to reporters to be made up of five white women and a sixth who may be Hispanic. The jurors did not talk to reporters after the verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race issues overwhelmed Zimmerman trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing all the evidence and watching all the witnesses give their testimony, the jury in the trial of George Zimmerman for shooting and killing Trayvon&nbsp;Martin came in with a not guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many trial attorneys, with the exception of Florida's prosecuting attorneys, not only agreed with the jury but thought this case would never have come to trial had it not become political, influenced by the usual race issue proponents such as Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even our African-American President Barack Obama found it necessary to announce to the nation that &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could be wrong, but it doesn't look like there will be rioting despite the anger and disappointment shown by some, including the leadership of the NAACP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way of nipping that in the bud would be for Obama to invite Martin's parents and Zimmerman to the White House to bare their hearts about the tragedy that this case represented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Ernie Pellegrino, Middleton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How 'stand your ground' and juries really work</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are some lives worth less than others? George Zimmerman, a white male, shot and killed unarmed African-American teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, and a jury found him not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida in 2012, Marissa Alexander, an African-American woman confronted by her allegedly abusive husband, fired a warning shot into the wall at her home to ward him off. She invoked Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law but was convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced to 20 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stand your ground&quot; works only if you're white. &quot;Jury of your peers&quot; works only if you have highly paid lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health care works only if you're well off. Control of your body works only if you're male. Job creation works only if you're the employer. Elections work only if you're a corporation. Private education works only if you're not disabled. Soon, public education will not work at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now, we have David Koch's &quot;economic freedom&quot; TV ad telling us to be grateful for a $34,000 annual salary. This from a man worth $43 billion who extols economic freedom while shaming us for wanting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic freedom works only if you already have it. And, if you haven't got economic freedom, a corporate logo, white skin, and aren't a man, your life is worth less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Sheila Plotkin, McFarland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Focus on trials with substance, like Manning's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American public has once again been swept up in a public trial monsoon. At least the trial and acquittal of George Zimmerman has had some larger social and legal relevance that might justify the over-the-top news coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, a current trial has been practically blacked out by the mainstream media - the trial of Bradley Manning for his leaking of government and military secrets to Wikileaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I admire Manning for his bravery in bringing horrible but necessary truths to light. I also feel sympathy for Manning for being victimized, first by childhood bullies and then by cruel and unusual treatment, including months of solitary confinement, after his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manning trial has been conducted in secrecy, some caused by the conditions of a military trial, but more because of journalistic complicity. The public shares in the blame. Political trials lack the sexiness of murder trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are doomed, I fear, to be fed a constant diet of murder trials while more important trials (and issues) will be ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; envisions a society amusing itself to death. Our own cultural preference for entertainment over substance shows Huxley was sadly prophetic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- George Savage, Madison</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community must prepare for climate change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 10 I attended a forum on climate change preparedness, organized by Dane County Executive Joe Parisi. It is gratifying to have a political leader who is thinking ahead, planning for challenges that a changing climate will bring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attendees learned we can expect wetter, warmer winters, more intense storms, and more summer days above 90 degrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dane County departments have brainstormed about how these conditions will affect their work and what they can do to be ready for weather-related emergencies. But citizens should not just assume the authorities will deal with the problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighborhood groups should discuss what residents can do to protect the vulnerable during heat waves and floods and the power outages and water contamination that can result from floods. An organized, prepared citizenry can help emergency personnel. Let's start the discussions, workshops and activities now to preserve lives later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These events also teach us how to limit our carbon footprints while creating community bonds. Fossil fuels use got us into this situation, and we need to wean ourselves from them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The county executive's third forum will be held Wednesday from 6-7:30 p.m. at the Middleton Public Library, 7425 Hubbard Ave.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahigh-profile criminal case tends to bring out our inner litigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Combine a 24-hour news cycle with a dose of &quot;CSI&quot; and &quot;Law and Order&quot; ... and it's hard not to become an &quot;expert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time the jury gets the case, everyone has a pretty good idea of what the verdict should be. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guilty, of course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or innocent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It depends on your cable news network of choice and the narrative to which you subscribe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In cases like these, some people are going to be outraged no matter what the jury decides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's certain, though, that acquittals draw the loudest gasps -- the four police officers in the videotaped beating of Rodney King, O.J. Simpson and Casey Anthony to name a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When race is also a factor, as it was in the King case and now in George Zimmerman's trial, emotions run even higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A neighborhood watch volunteer, Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder Saturday in the death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hard as it might be to accept, only the jury heard all of the testimony and saw every piece of evidence presented at trial, and only they had the opportunity to debate the case with others who had the same information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time members of that panel retired after receiving instructions from the judge, only they were the experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what the prosecution and defense agreed to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, the son of a Hispanic mother and white father, thought the 17-year-old looked suspicious and out of place that rainy night in February 2012 as the teen walked through the gated community of the Retreat at Twin Lakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After calling 911, Zimmerman disregarded a dispatcher's instructions and got out of his car. Under Florida's Stand Your Ground law, he was not required to retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within minutes the two were face to face and a struggle ensued. Zimmerman, who was armed with a handgun, shot Martin in the chest, killing the teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To some, it was a clear-cut case of racial profiling. Zimmerman saw a black male wearing a hoodie and set in motion a chain of events that left an innocent young man dead. Martin had been minding his own business, walking to the home of his father's girlfriend after buying snacks at a convenience store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others -- including the jury -- believed Zimmerman's claim of self-defense, that he used deadly force while in fear for his life during the confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not surprisingly, the verdict prompted nationwide protests, which have been mostly peaceful so far -- nothing like the deadly riots in 1992 after the four Los Angeles Police Department officers were acquitted of beating King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We think that's in part because Martin's parents and supporters asked for calm, even though they were surely heartbroken by the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story doesn't end here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week the U.S. Justice Department announced it's looking into whether Zimmerman violated Martin's civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a tactic the department also used after the Rodney King verdict, resulting in two of the officers being convicted and imprisoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents also are pursuing a civil case against Zimmerman. That, too, has been used successfully after a controversial acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The families of murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman sued Simpson for damages in a civil case and a jury found the former football star responsible for their deaths. He was ordered to pay $33.5 million to the families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So there's a chance Zimmerman still might pay a price for his actions. He definitely will be &quot;looking around his shoulder for the rest of his life,&quot; according to his brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, though, we have to respect the jury's decision -- even if we don't agree with it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yorkers will join people across the nation in a peaceful demonstration Saturday to honor the life of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager whose killer was acquitted Saturday of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizer Sandie Walker said she envisions a prayerful vigil near the York County Judicial Center to honor Martin followed by a speaker-driven discussion of the larger issues surrounding the emotional case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker said she'd prefer to avoid focusing on George Zimmerman's not-guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opportunity: Instead, the York City School Board member said, this is an opportunity to talk about racial profiling and weaknesses in the United States' judicial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to be aware of the fact that race does still play a part, even if it's unconscious or conscious, it does affect how people act and how they react at times,&quot; Walker said. &quot;Let's just be honest and speak about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group will gather at noon Saturday near the courthouse, 45 N. George St. Other cities across the nation are planning similar vigils, Walker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case: On Feb. 26, 2012, Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, followed 17-year-old Martin as he walked to the home of his father's girlfriend after buying snacks at a convenience store. Following a struggle, Zimmerman shot the unarmed black teenager in the chest. He claimed self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal has triggered emotional outrage, especially among those who believe Zimmerman targeted Martin because of the way he looked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what happened during those minutes when they encountered each other,&quot; Walker said. &quot;But what I do know is another life has been lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March in D.C.: Another group of Yorkers is planning to join a protest march in Washington, D.C., next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the organizers, Rebecca Moore, said the Zimmerman case touched a nerve with her especially because of her own experience as a neighborhood watch volunteer. Zimmerman should never have followed Martin, especially after a 911 dispatcher advised him not to, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're fearful for your life, you're not getting out of your vehicle and approaching anybody,&quot; Moore said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bus seating 55 people will leave York from Small Athletic Field at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, July 24. In Washington, they'll join a 3 p.m. march to the U.S. Department of Justice building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers split the cost of the bus 55 ways, resulting in each seat costing $23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money is due Monday. Contact Moore at (717) 424-3676 to reserve a spot on the bus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere,&quot; Moore said. &quot;If we keep sitting back and allowing the injustice to prevail, we're just as guilty as the person that's creating the injustice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VIGILS and rallies are to be held in 100 US cities this weekend to press for federal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman over the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, the Rev Al Sharpton said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prominent civil rights activist announced the plan at a news conference with several church ministers outside the Justice Department in Washington. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not say which cities would be involved, but did say the rallies and vigils will be staged on Saturday at federal buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal over the weekend touched off protests around the country. The Justice Department is investigating whether he violated the black teenager's civil rights when he shot the 17-year-old during a confrontation in Sanford, Florida, in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighbourhood watch volunteer, 29, said he fired his gun in self-defence, and a jury acquitted him of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sharpton was speaking after violence erupted on the West Coast during protests over the acquittal. In Los Angeles 13 people were arrested after a protest turned violent; at least one person was injured and police made nine arrests in violence in Oakland. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, blinked and barely smiled when the verdict was announced. He could have been convicted of second-degree murder or manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the jury of six women, all but one of them white, reached a verdict of not guilty after deliberating for more than 15 hours over the course of two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's mother and father were not in the courtroom when the verdict was read; supporters of his family who had gathered outside yelled ``No! No!'' upon learning of the not-guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teen's father, Tracy, reacted on Twitter: ``Even though I am broken hearted my faith is unshattered I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MY BABY TRAY.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, said simply: ``Et tu America?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors considered nearly three weeks of often wildly conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor on the rainy night the 17-year-old was shot while walking through the gated townhouse community where he was staying and where Zimmerman lived. None of the witnesses who were called had a clear view of the encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence attorneys said the case was classic self-defence, claiming Martin knocked Zimmerman down and was slamming the older man's head against the concrete sidewalk when Zimmerman fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We're ecstatic with the results,'' defence attorney Mark O'Mara said after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors called Zimmerman a liar and portrayed him was a ``wannabe cop'' vigilante who had grown frustrated by break-ins in his neighbourhood committed primarily by young black men. Zimmerman assumed Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands, prosecutors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the verdict drew near, police and city leaders in the Orlando suburb of Sanford and other parts of Florida said they were taking precautions against the possibility of mass protests or unrest in the event of an acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump acknowledged the disappointment of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's supporters, ranking the teen alongside civil rights heroes in the history of the fight for equal justice. But he urged them not to resort to violence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Some say it's result of racial profiling; others say it was self-defense.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday night, a six-woman Florida jury cleared George Zimmerman --- who has maintained it was an act of self-defense --- in the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. The acquittal stoked an already hot dialogue about race, the media, violence, gun control and the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like in other cities across the country on Sunday, people turned out for gatherings and marches that popped up in Atlanta, including in the West End and Centennial Olympic Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some conservatives, gun-rights advocates and others have lauded the decision as an unfortunate result of self-defense, others have labeled it as another example of the devaluation of young black men --- calling Martin a modern-day Emmett Till, the 14-year-old whose 1955 lynching in Mississippi helped spark the modern civil rights movement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's face it, if both people in this tragedy were of common ethnicity, there would be no media feeding frenzy,&quot; said Alveda King, director of African Outreach for Priests for Life and the niece of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. &quot;The gun control debate is a smokescreen. Guns don't kill people. People kill people. Yes, sometimes they use guns, but they sometimes use bombs or knives too. We definitely need love control and heart control and nonviolence control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Fabbrini, president of the Glenside homeowners association in East Cobb, would have been surprised if Zimmerman had been found guilty and thinks the media and some public figures shifted the conversation toward race instead of focusing on the facts of the case and the personal tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been sensationalized,&quot; said Fabbrini. &quot;It's a shame that anyone lost their life in this situation. I'm not sure what it says about us, but I don't know why we pick out this one particular story when there are hundreds of situations like this a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find it troubling that in 2013, racial profiling and stereotyping are enough to justify the taking of a life,&quot; said Donald Edward Mason III, a 19-year-old Morehouse College sophomore. &quot;I feel bad for his family. He was taken from them without justification, because Zimmerman felt Trayvon was a threat. And it's also demoralizing because this could happen to me just because of how I look.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, President Barack Obama, who said last March that if he had a son, he would &quot;look like Trayvon,&quot; called for calm and moving forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Atlanta, a close ally of Martin Luther King Jr., said he was deeply disappointed in the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems to justify the stalking and killing of innocent black boys and deny them any avenue of self-defense,&quot; Lewis said. &quot;On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, I think it demonstrates the distance this nation still must go to fulfill the vision of equal justice Martin Luther King Jr. gave his life to defend. I hope this verdict will serve to open some kind of meaningful dialogue on the issues of race and justice in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Sunday, the Justice Department said it is looking into the case to determine whether federal prosecutors will file criminal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local civil rights activist Markel Hutchins said the problems stem from one thing --- race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They tried to say that race was not a factor, but it had a great deal to do with race,&quot; Hutchins said. &quot;If George Zimmerman had been black and killed a young white man, he would have long been in jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Saturday night, when the verdict was read and Zimmerman had been found not guilty, 7-year-old London Brown sat next to his father, a retired deputy sheriff and his mother, a Harvard University graduate student and asked why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What stood out to him the most is that a 'man' killed a 'little boy,'&quot; said his mother, Monisha Brown. &quot;I am still struggling with what to say to him that will be age-appropriate, meaningful and not too emotional. I have to be careful with how I mold his mind. I have said that it was wrong, but right now we have to forgive Zimmerman and uphold Trayvon's family in prayer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's complex feelings are shared by many, regardless of on what side of the verdict they stood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In calling Martin's killing a &quot;modern-day lynching,&quot; Georgia State Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta, challenged politicians to move toward legislative reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must revisit racial profiling and Stand Your Ground laws and we must fight for common sense gun safety laws,&quot; Fort said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Edward Lindsey, R-Atlanta, said the jury's verdict should be respected, because the system worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I would say the same thing if the verdict had gone the other way,&quot; Lindsey said in a statement. &quot;Pray for the young man who died too young and for his family that mourns his loss. Pray for George Zimmerman and his family as they move on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sentiment was also expressed by many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the American public we need to trust the jury made a decision that matched the evidence,&quot; said Jane Mattingly, a Suwannee mother of two. &quot;We need to not get pulled into the media sensation because it revolves around race. If I feel threatened, especially if my children were with me, I would protect my children. People need to accept the decision and move on, because it's not about race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, pastors and community activists used church pulpits, as they have in decades past, to galvanize emotion into action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Thankful Missionary Baptist Church in Decatur, activists spoke of creating a mentorship program in Martin's name, registering people to vote in the upcoming elections and marching today from the King Center to CNN headquarters in downtown Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of church members gathered at the alter and circled their children to pray for their safety and future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early Sunday morning, less than 12 hours after the verdict, London Brown woke up before his parents and asked for his daily instruction, in what his mother Monisha called his &quot;cute little cartoonish voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My back was turned. It was the first voice I heard this morning. I didn't move. I told him to go take his shower and brush his teeth,&quot; Brown said, adding that she and her husband planned on talking to him about the verdict over Sunday dinner. &quot;I laid there thinking about Sybrina Fulton. My heart is heavy for her as a mom because she will never hear her baby's voice again. The last thing she heard was Trayvon's last call for help.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department has a long history of using federal civil rights law in an effort to convict defendants who have previously been acquitted in related state cases. Experience has shown it's almost never easy getting convictions in such high-profile prosecutions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said Sunday it is looking into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin to determine whether to file criminal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are several factual and legal hurdles that federal prosecutors would have to overcome,&quot; said Alan Vinegrad, a former U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York. &quot;They'd have to show not only that the attack was unjustified, but that Mr. Zimmerman attacked Mr. Martin because of his race and because he was using a public facility, the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the last element, the confrontation occurred in a gated community, which might not fit the legal definition of a public facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lauren Resnick, a former federal prosecutor in New York who successfully prosecuted a man in the killing of an Orthodox Jew during the 1991 Crown Heights riots in Brooklyn, said the Justice Department could conceivably proceed under a theory that Zimmerman interfered with Martin's right to walk down a public street based on his race. But that would be challenging, she said, because it would require prosecutors to prove, among other things, that trailing Martin on the street constituted interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One could argue it did, if it freaked him out and he couldn't comfortably walk down the street - there's an argument here,&quot; she said. But she said federal prosecutors were likely to encounter the same hurdles as state prosecutors in establishing that Zimmerman was driven by racial animus and was the aggressor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you have a fact pattern where one person's alive, and one person's not, and the person alive is the defendant, it's hard to prove things beyond a reasonable doubt,&quot; Resnick said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're trying to prove racial motivation, you are usually looking for multiple statements related to why he is engaging in this act of violence,&quot; said Samuel Bagenstos, a former No. 2 official in the Justice Department's civil rights division. &quot;I think it's a difficult case to prove.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department has a host of criminal civil rights laws at its disposal, and has made such cases in the past. Among them: the federal prosecution of a group of Los Angeles police officers after they were acquitted in state court of the brutal beating of Rodney King in 1991, which sparked riots in that city. Two of the four officers were eventually convicted by a federal jury of violating King's civil rights under &quot;color of law&quot; - that is, beating him up in their capacity as police. But that law applies only to those in law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are comparing this case to Rod-ney King, where there was a federal prosecution after a state acquittal, but the difference there was there were witnesses, specifically the video everyone still remembers,&quot; said Brian Tannebaum, a Miami defense attorney and past president of the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, &quot;Zimmerman was a failed prosecution from the beginning - where the only witness (Zimmerman) had the right to remain silent - and I don't think the federal government will try again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury's verdict to acquit George Zimmerman in the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, a case that became a referendum on race and gun laws for many across the nation, did not turn on how those issues played out in court, legal experts said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, they said, the acquittal can prob-ably be blamed on mistakes by prosecutors in bringing a murder charge they could not prove. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Justice Depart-ment announced Sunday that it would continue its investigation of the case to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated in the shooting of Martin, 17. In a statement, the department noted that its jurisdiction is limited: &quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine ... whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department's policy governing successive federal prosecution after a state trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal prosecution could resurrect a case that many legal analysts said was doomed by Florida prosecutors' decision to pursue a hard-to-prove second-degree murder conviction against Zimmerman - responding to the recommendations of a special prosecutor appointed in the wake of a nationwide outcry over the youth's killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nationally televised trial exposed the flaws of that decision and the weakness of the state's criminal case. Prosecutors could not prove Zimmerman was driven by &quot;ill will or hatred&quot; - the necessary elements of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">murder case - when he got out of his vehicle on a rainy night and went after the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the confrontation that followed, they also could not prove Zimmerman struck the first blow. If the teenager turned in fear to attack the stranger who was pursuing him, Zimmerman could claim he acted in self-defense. If the jurors were in doubt as to who struck first, they were obliged to hand down an acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why few criminal law experts were surprised by the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The prosecutors made a tactical error by charging this as second-degree murder,&quot; said Charles H. Rose, a professor at Stetson University College of Law. &quot;Their theory was that George Zimmerman picked out this young black kid and set out to do him harm. But at the trial, it became clear it didn't happen that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed to evidence showing Zimmerman had been injured in the fight and that a witness who saw the two struggling said it appeared the teenager was on top. A defense pathologist testified the forensic evidence was consistent with Zimmerman's claim that Martin was on top and hitting him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rose said prosecutors might have succeeded had they charged Zimmerman from the start with manslaughter or assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a news conference after the verdict, Angela B. Corey, the state's attorney who brought the charges, angrily denied the suggestion that Zimmerman was overcharged. &quot;We charged what we had based on the facts of the case,&quot; she told reporters. &quot;We truly believe the mindset of George Zimmerman and the reason he was doing what he did fit the bill for second-degree murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Near the end of the trial, prosecutors urged the jury to convict Zimmerman of the lesser charge of manslaughter. But it was too late then to re-focus the case, several experts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although the facts are tragic, I don't think they should have brought this as a murder case,&quot; said Laurie Levenson, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. &quot;It would have been more plausible to argue that Zimmerman was grossly negligent and that he brought on the confrontation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A FLORIDA jury acquitted George Zimmerman of all charges in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin yesterday, bringing to an end a case that set off protests across the US and searing debates over racial justice and self-defence laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, 29, a former neighbourhood-watch volunteer who is Hispanic, fatally shot the 17-year-old, who was unarmed and black, in a gated community last year. The defendant faced a second-degree murder charge, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison, and the lesser charge of manslaughter, which carries a 30-year maximum. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the verdict was read, Mr Zimmerman appeared stoic. When the not-guilty verdict was pronounced, his family members embraced. Police removed Mr Zimmerman's ankle bracelet, and he flashed a smile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six female jurors reached the decision on their second day of deliberation at the Seminole County courthouse. They had to weigh the testimony of more than 50 witnesses and hundreds of pieces of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors accused Mr Zimmerman of profiling Trayvon as a criminal, following him and triggering the confrontation that ended with the teen's death. Defence lawyers argued that Trayvon was the aggressor, punching Mr Zimmerman in the face, scuffling with him on the ground and bashing his head against a concrete walkway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides presented duelling portraits of Mr Zimmerman. His lawyers depicted him as a dedicated member of the community who repeatedly offered help to his neighbours. They called witnesses who testified that he was a bumbling fighter who would have succumbed to Trayvon in a brawl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors cast him as an aggressive vigilante who was angry about a recent string of burglaries in the neighbourhood and determined to go after any potential troublemakers. They quoted profanity-laced comments he made to police about ``punks'' who ``always get away''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite all the evidence and witness testimony, key details of what happened the night of February 26 last year remain elusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was walking back to his father's girlfriend's home when Mr Zimmerman spotted him and called police to report a ``suspicious'' person. When a police dispatcher asked Mr Zimmerman if he was following him, he replied, ``Yeah.'' The dispatcher said that was unnecessary. What happened next is unclear. The two tussled, but no witnesses saw who started the fight. That left lawyers on both sides to try to fill in the blanks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors called to the stand Rachel Jeantel, a friend of Trayvon's who said she was on the phone with him moments before he was killed. ``Why are you following me for?'' she said she heard Trayvon say. A voice responded, ``What are you doing around here?'' she said. Then she heard a bump and Trayvon saying, ``Get off, get off,'' Ms Jeantel testified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyers sought to discredit her testimony by highlighting what they claimed were several lies she told. In presenting their case, they floated the possibility Trayvon lay in wait for Mr Zimmerman and assaulted him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another question never definitively answered was whose screams could be heard in the background of a 911 call on the night of the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides also wrangled over the severity of Mr Zimmerman's injuries. Prosecutors minimised them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence summoned expert witnesses who testified that the pounding Mr Zimmerman took was serious enough to make him fear for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his closing argument, defence lawyer Mark O'Mara urged jurors not to make assumptions in a case riddled with uncertainties. ``You can't fill in the gaps,'' he told them. ``You can't connect the dots for the state attorney's office.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, jurors had to contend with murky evidence and conflicting versions of events. Considering the verdict they rendered, the defence appeared to raise sufficient doubts about the strength of the prosecution's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At back-to-back press conferences after the verdict, the prosecution and the defence continued some of the sniping that characterised their battle in the courtroom. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Trayvon's family, likewise called for any demonstrations to remain calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``For Trayvon to rest in peace, we must all be peaceful,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyer Don West voiced his displeasure with the course of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The prosecution of George Zimmerman was disgraceful,'' said Mr West, who repeatedly complained before and during the trial about alleged delays by the state in handing over evidence. His partner on the defence, Mark O'Mara, chastised the media for depicting Mr Zimmerman as a monster and lamented that the case became ensnared in racial issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``This became the focus of a civil-rights event,'' he said. But ``it was a self-defence case''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant state attorney Bernie de la Rionda was visibly tense as he commented on the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Who was following who? Isn't that what this case boils down to?'' he said. ``I respect the jury's verdict, but really what it boils down to is a kid minding his own business being followed by a stranger, and I would submit that's when it started.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict by a Florida jury that George Zimmerman is not guilty of murder or manslaughter in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin settles -- pending review by the U.S. Justice Department -- the legal question of his criminal culpability. Jurors listened attentively and deliberated carefully, and the rule of law must be respected. But the central tragedy of this case -- the death of a 17-year-old boy who had been on a simple errand to get snacks -- remains. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, shot Martin on Feb. 26, 2012, claiming self-defense after he said the teenager knocked him to the ground and hit his head against the sidewalk. Martin, who was unarmed, was walking back to his father's home after going to a store for candy and a soft drink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never a simple homicide, Martin's death became the subject of a charged debate about race, criminal profiling and Florida's permissive &quot;stand your ground&quot; gun law. One reason the death of this boy in a gray hooded sweatshirt so resonated that even the president of the United States felt compelled to comment was that it brought to the surface historic concerns of minority parents about the vulnerability of their sons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, though, much of the public debate has done grievous disservice to the legitimacy of these issues. Hucksters and political demagogues exploited tragedy -- a boy's death, a family's grief, a man's freedom -- and created what has become the now all-too-familiar media circus of oversaturation and rush to judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guilt was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and Zimmerman is free to resume his life even as his attorney lamented that it &quot;will never be the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">That also is as it should be. Zimmerman could have done what police told him to do and stayed in his vehicle. No one would have heard about him -- and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been able to get home on that rainy Sunday evening.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PORTLAND, Maine -- Proponents of legalizing the recreational use of marijuana in Maine's largest city evoked the controversial George Zimmerman verdict during a Monday news conference in Portland and said laws against pot are used to unfairly target blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our justice system is failing us,&quot; said Regina Phillips, an executive board member of the Maine NAACP, during the event. &quot;It does not treat people equally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news conference was held to rally support for a proposed ordinance change that would decriminalize possession of the drug in Portland just hours before the city council effectively voted to place the ordinance amendment on the Nov. 5 citywide ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch coordinator, was found not guilty of murder last week in the Feb. 26, 2012, shooting death of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida. The high-profile case has been been protested by many civil rights groups as an example of racial inequality, first because Zimmerman was not initially charged in the shooting, and subsequently after a jury found him not guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman claimed self-defense in the case, but critics have pointed to the fact that Martin was unarmed and that police subsequently reported that there was no indication the teen was involved in criminal activity at the time of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, legalization advocates recalled the flashpoint case and said the enforcement of anti-marijuana laws is another illustration of the criminal justice system targeting blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I strongly believe the outcome [in the George Zimmerman trial] wouldn't be the same if the roles were reversed -- if the shooter was black and the victim was white,&quot; Phillips said during the Monday afternoon news conference, later adding, &quot;We know that white people and black people use marijuana at roughly the same rate. Yet black people in Maine are twice as likely be arrested for marijuana-related charges as white people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">A coalition of groups calling itself Citizens for a Safer Portland -- including the Portland Green Independent Committee, the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, the Libertarian Party of Maine and the national Marijuana Policy Project -- collected 2,508 certified signatures of registered Portland voters on a petition seeking to legalize possession of small amounts of pot and marijuana paraphernalia in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who attended the Monday afternoon news conference said that, according to 2010 figures, blacks are 2.1 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession in Maine than whites -- with 461 such arrests per 100,000 black people compared to 216 arrests on the charge per the same number of whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contrast is most glaring in York County, where the ratio was 1,399 blacks against 282 whites to face the marijuana possession charge -- meaning blacks in Maine's southernmost county were five times more likely to be arrested on the pot charge than their white counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of the Zimmerman verdict, Portland Green Independent Committee Secretary Adam Marletta said, that disparity takes on renewed significance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is certainly a racial component, but considering the events of recent days, I feel more strongly [about it],&quot; Marletta, who said he plans to run for a seat on the council, said during the afternoon news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday evening, the city council voted not to accept the rule changes sought by the coalition's petition, a procedural move that instead places the ordinance proposal on a citywide ballot to be decided by voters in the fall, a step which many in the advocacy groups said they preferred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote not to accept the petition changes was 5-1, with Councilor David Marshall in favor of the ordinance change and councilors John Anton, Cheryl Leeman and Jill Duson absent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coalition needed about 1,500 signatures from registered Portland voters to push the legalization issue to a citywide or council vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legalization ordinance proposed by the coalition would allow adults age 21 and older to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana as well as pot paraphernalia within city limits, while prohibiting recreational use of the drug in public spaces, including school grounds and on public transportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Talbot, representing the ACLU of Maine during the Monday afternoon event, referenced a statistic claiming Maine spent $8.9 million during the most recent U.S. census year of 2010 enforcing marijuana laws, and that 47.9 percent of all drug arrests in the state that year were for pot charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Maine alone, nearly $9 million is spent on enforcing marijuana laws [annually],&quot; he said. &quot;Those are taxpayers' dollars that could be spent on hospitals or schools or finding solutions to more serious problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pot legalization effort was dealt a blow at the statewide level during the recently completed legislative session, during which a bill that would have legalized recreational use of the drug statewide attracted 35 co-sponsors but did not gain the endorsement of the Legislature's Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee. The House and Senate subsequently voted down a follow-up proposal that would have put the legalization issue before voters on statewide ballots in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proponents of the legalization measure, including councilor Marshall, have said the prohibition of the drug is ineffective and drives use of the substance underground. They say pot use should be allowed, regulated and taxed the same way as alcohol, which was prohibited in the 1920s in what is largely considered a failed initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opponents of the move, including the Maine Chiefs of Police Association, argue that the step would exacerbate substance abuse problems that feed other crimes, and that overseeing regulation and distribution of pot would be an expensive and time-consuming task for overburdened state agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Maine Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services has argued that marijuana today has more than double the mind-altering chemical THC that the pot on the market in 1983 had, making it more potent and addictive, and that teenagers may be more likely to experiment with the drug after hearing legalization advocates downplay the danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jo Morrissey of the substance abuse prevention group 21 Reasons distributed cards to attendees of the council meeting Monday night stating that Portland high schoolers became less likely to believe marijuana is harmful and more likely to use the drug after medicinal use of pot was legalized in the state in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts to defang enforcement of marijuana laws in Portland in the past have fallen short. In 2011, activists gathered signatures on a petition seeking to make pot possession offenses the lowest enforcement priority for Portland police. But despite getting more than 2,100 signatures on the petition -- 600 more than necessary to gain a spot on the local ballot -- the city clerk's office found the document was invalid because only about 1,400 of the names were from verified Portland residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2005, voters in Denver passed a law making it legal to possess a small amount of marijuana. It was the first major U.S. city to do so. In 2012, Colorado joined Washington as the first states to legalize recreational marijuana use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine is one of 18 states in which marijuana can be legally used for medical reasons, prescribed to patients to fight chronic pain, among other ailments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For those struggling in Sanford on Sunday to accept the acquittal of George Zimmerman over the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, there were combative sermons and prayers for understanding, but little immediate solace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I couldn't go to sleep last night and I didn't want to awaken this morning, to the devastating reality that hatred, prejudice and injustice pollutes the air of America,&quot; said an emotional Pastor Valerie Houston to the strains of Gospel tunes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the expense of the life of an innocent, unarmed African American teenager. America, our country, which professes that we are one nation under God, with liberty and justice for all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large crowds of stone-faced worshipers gathered in Sanford, 250 miles (400 kilometers) north of Miami, the morning after the night before, when a jury found neighborhood watch volunteer Zimmerman not guilty of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long and racially-charged trial transfixed much of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing Martin, 17, through a gated community in Sanford, and shooting him during an altercation in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dr (Martin Luther) King (Jr) stated, the daily life of the Negro is still in the basement of the Great Society,&quot; Houston said. &quot;And today I state, the daily life of my people is still enslaved to a white supremacist society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, she insisted: &quot;We are not at the bottom unless we continue to see ourselves there, the innocent shed blood of Jesus, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, Medgar Evers, Emmett Till and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin should propel us to soar to higher levels in all areas of society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geraldine Burke, 88, in a red hat and black pumps, said: &quot;Today I felt it was necessary to come to church to be united as community. It's a sad day for us and for the country, another sad day of our sad history in our beloved country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allen Chapel in Sanford's Goldsboro neighborhood welcomed many locals to worship not far from the scene of Martin's death. Others drove from miles away specifically to be here, in this mostly-white small city of 54.000, such was their frustration at the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the worst lesson that we could have from our justice system, but we must continue to trust in our judicial system. Violence is not the answer,&quot; insisted churchgoer Dominique Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This trial began by asking if Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was criminal or victim. Now it is clear to us that Zimmerman was a criminal because he followed Trayvon because he wanted to do it. Zimmerman was a criminal because he used a gun and used violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, however, allows armed people who feel threatened to shoot in self-defense, and such was the argument that Zimmerman's attorneys made successfully to a six-woman jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands protested in US cities overnight as President Barack Obama appealed for calm following the acquittal in Florida of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The angry protests highlight simmering racial tensions after a jury found volunteer watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering 17 year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators held noisy rallies in US cities including New York, San Francisco, Boston, Detroit and Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least six people were arrested in Los Angeles early Monday when riot police broke up an &quot;unlawful assembly&quot; in Hollywood near the CNN building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the chants of &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; a separate crowd blocked traffic on an important freeway elsewhere in the giant metropolis, local media reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Memories are still fresh of the deadly April 1992 riots in Los Angeles, which broke out after a similar racially-tinged trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest rally Sunday was in New York City, where several thousand -- including families with children -- marched to Times Square under the watchful eye of police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in the multi-racial crowd brandished signs bearing a portrait of Martin, while some, despite sweltering July heat, wore &quot;hoodie&quot; sweatshirts as the teen did the night he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am appalled,&quot; said Carli VanVoorhis, a 21-year-old hairdresser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The man was armed, the kid was not, and the man with the gun got away,&quot; she said. &quot;If we say it was not a racial issue, we would be lying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a big problem with race, and another problem is guns,&quot; said protester Rodney Rodriguez. &quot;If Zimmerman didn't have a gun, he couldn't have killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow protester Derreck Wilson, 46, said the group had come &quot;to say in a peaceful way why we are angry. We are angry, scared and anxious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's cathartic,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all have the same desires. I want to be able to have my son to come home,&quot; added Wilson, who came to the protest from the traditionally African-American neighborhood of Harlem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has pitted those who believe that Zimmerman, a 29-year-old Hispanic neighborhood watchman, killed Martin in self-defense, and those who believe it was a murder sparked by racist assumptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, the first black US president, urged Americans to step back and accept the trial verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,&quot; the president said in a statement. &quot;I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was accused of pursuing Martin through a gated community in the town of Sanford and shooting him during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense successfully argued that Zimmerman fired his handgun in self-defense after the teen wrestled him to the ground and was slamming his head against the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, people who fear for their lives can use deadly force to defend themselves without having to flee a confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this,&quot; Obama said. &quot;As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama last year spoke emotionally about the case, noting that if he had a son he would &quot;look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racial divide was evident in Sanford pastor Valerie Houston's Sunday sermon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dr (Martin Luther) King (Jr) stated, the daily life of the Negro is still in the basement of the Great Society,&quot; she said. &quot;And today I state, the daily life of my people is still enslaved to a white supremacist society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents -- father, Tracy, and mother Sybrina Fulton -- asked the public before the verdict to respect the trial outcome, and afterwards gave thanks for the outpouring of support they received over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump declined to say whether they would file a civil lawsuit against Zimmerman, but said &quot;they are going to certainly look at that as an option.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They deeply want a sense of justice. They deeply don't want their son's death to be in vain,&quot; he told ABC News's &quot;This Week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Justice Department said Sunday it will resume its probe into whether hate crime charges can be brought against Zimmerman. The probe was put on hold until after the Florida trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal prosecutors &quot;will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction,&quot; it said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the acquittal, Zimmerman's lawyers told the Washington Post that they will immediately resume a defamation lawsuit against NBC News for selectively editing a phone call to police which made their client seem like a racist. That case was also put on hold pending the trial results.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin never had a chance -- not in his encounter with George Zimmerman, in which a teenager with a bag of candy confronted a hothead with a gun, and not by proxy when his grieving parents encountered the &quot;justice&quot; system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be easy to write off the verdict clearing Mr. Zimmerman as one of those periodic courtroom aberrations or another horror story to come out of Florida, but that would be too easy. From violent beginning to disturbing end, the Martin-Zimmerman saga speaks volumes about racism and racial profiling in America, as well as the gun violence that sickens America like a persistent bacterial virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 17-year-old Mr. Martin was found guilty of walking while black by Mr. Zimmerman, a wannabe cop and gun-toting, self-appointed neighborhood watchdog with a criminal record who saw a young black man in a hooded sweatshirt and profiled him as one of those criminals who always get away with it. Ignoring the admonitions of a 911 operator who told him to stay in his car, Mr. Zimmerman began stalking Mr. Martin as the young man walked from a 7-11 to the home of his father's girlfriend. A confrontation ensued. Mr. Zimmerman ended up with some cuts and bruises, Mr. Martin ended up dead from a bullet wound. A Florida jury heard all of this and found Mr. Zimmerman innocent of any crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury's verdict neatly bookends the behavior of police in Sanford, Florida, when they arrived at the crime scene in February of last year. They found Mr. Zimmerman, his gun, and the dead, unarmed 17-year-old, and sent Mr. Zimmerman on his way. Nothing to see here. Only a nation's outrage when the shooting finally came to light six weeks later forced authorities to grudgingly pursue an investigation and bring charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's indefensible shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later gun law, which allows someone who feels &quot;threatened&quot; to come out with guns blazing, enabled Mr. Zimmerman's actions. The verdicts will cement this law in place, and worse, inspire other trigger-happy state governments to pass similar laws, setting the stage for similar horrific incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, the nation is outraged, but its outrage must go no further than peaceful marches and protests. Resorting to violence is how the Zimmermans of the world behave. America has come far since the civil rights era, but it plainly has a long way to go when it comes to eradicating racist stereotypes. As for America's love of guns and predilection for violence, things only seem to get worse.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - The Indiana Pacers have officially announced they signed free-agent forward Chris Copeland, who spent last season with the New York Knicks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copeland averaged 8.7 points on 47.9 percent shooting, including 42.1 percent from 3-point range, and 2.1 rebounds per game while helping lead the Knicks to the Atlantic Division title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before signing with the Knicks in 2012, Copeland played overseas in Belgium, Germany and Spain. The former University of Colorado standout also played one season in the NBA Developmental League. Larry Bird, the Pacers' president of basketball operations, calls Copeland &quot;a great addition&quot; because of his versatility.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department said Sunday it is looking into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin to determine whether federal prosecutors will file criminal civil rights charges now that George Zimmerman has been acquitted in the state case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department opened an investigation into Martin's death last year but stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the Justice Department said the criminal section of its civil rights division, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office for the Middle District of Florida are continuing to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal probe, in addition to the evidence and testimony from the state trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction,&quot; the statement said. Justice added that it will determine &quot;whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the Rodney King case in Los Angeles to the Algiers Motel incident in Detroit more than four decades ago, the Justice Department has a long history of using federal civil rights law in an effort to convict defendants who have previously been acquitted in related state cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous started a petition calling for the Justice Department to open a civil rights case against Zimmerman for the shooting death of 17-year-old Martin, but experience has shown it's almost never easy getting convictions in such high-profile prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Justice Department would face significant challenges in bringing a federal civil rights case against Mr. Zimmerman,&quot; said Alan Vinegrad, the former U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York. &quot;There are several factual and legal hurdles that federal prosecutors would have to overcome: They'd have to show not only that the attack was unjustified, but that Mr. Zimmerman attacked Mr. Martin because of his race and because he was using a public facility, the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the last element, the confrontation between Zimmerman and the shooting victim occurred in a gated community, which may not fit the legal definition of a public facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lauren Resnick, a former federal prosecutor in New York who successfully prosecuted a man in the killing of an Orthodox Jew during the 1991 Crown Heights riots in Brooklyn, said the Justice Department could conceivably proceed under a theory that Zimmerman interfered with Martin's right to walk down a public street based on his race. But that would be challenging, she said, because it would require prosecutors to prove, among other things, that trailing Martin on the street constituted interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One could argue it did, if it freaked him out and he couldn't comfortably walk down the street - there's an argument here,&quot; said Resnick, who now specializes in white-collar criminal defense and commercial litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she said federal prosecutors were likely to encounter the same hurdles as state prosecutors in establishing that Zimmerman was driven by racial animus and was the initial aggressor, as opposed to someone who acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you have a fact pattern where one person's alive, and one person's not, and the person alive is the defendant, it's hard to prove things beyond a reasonable doubt,&quot; said Resnick. She also said it was easier to prove a criminal bias in the Crown Heights killing than it would be in any federal prosecution of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SALINAS, Calif. -- On a windy morning in California's Salinas Valley, a tractor pulled a wheeled, refrigerator-sized contraption over rows of budding iceberg lettuce plants. Engineers from Silicon Valley tinkered with the software on a laptop to ensure the machine was eliminating the right leafy buds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hired by a Salinas-based agricultural produce company, the engineers were testing the Lettuce Bot, a machine that can &quot;thin&quot; a field of lettuce in the time it takes about 20 workers to do the job by hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thinner is part of a new generation of machines that target the last frontier of agricultural mechanization -- fruits and vegetables destined for the fresh market, not processing, which have thus far resisted mechanization because they're sensitive to bruising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers are now designing robots for these most delicate crops by integrating advanced sensors, powerful computing, electronics, computer vision, robotic hardware and algorithms, as well as networking and high precision GPS localization technologies. Most ag robots won't be commercially available for at least a few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this region known as America's Salad Bowl, where for a century fruits and vegetables have been planted, thinned and harvested by an army of migrant workers, the machines could prove revolutionary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though they cost millions of dollars, farmers say, the robots are worth the investment: They could provide relief from recent labor shortages,lessen the unknowns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of immigration reform, even reduce costs, increase quality and yield a more consistent product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There aren't enough workers to take the available jobs, so the robots can come and alleviate some of that problem,&quot; said Ron Yokota, a farming operations manager at Tanimura &amp; Antle, the fresh produce company that hired the Lettuce Bot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many sectors in U.S. agriculture have relied on machines for decades and even the harvesting of fruits and vegetables meant for processing has slowly been mechanized. But nationwide, the vast majority of fresh-market fruit is still harvested by hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research into fresh produce mechanization was dormant for years due to an over-abundance of workers and pressures from farmworker labor unions.show more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, as the labor supply has tightened and competition from abroad has increased, growers have sought out machines to reduce labor costs and supplement the nation's unstable agricultural workforce. The federal government, venture capital companies and commodity boards have stepped up with funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to increase our efficiency, but nobody wants to work in the fields,&quot; said Stavros G. Vougioukas, professor of biological</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this May 23, 2013, photo, field operations manager Matthew Rossow tests the lettuce bot in Salinas, Calif.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and agricultural engineering at the University of California, Davis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But farmworker advocates say mechanization would lead to workers losing jobs, growers using more pesticides and the food supply becoming less safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fundamental question for consumers is who and, now, what do you want picking your food; a machine or a human, who with the proper training and support, can&quot; ... take significant steps to ensure a safer, higher quality product, said Erik Nicholson, national vice president of the United Farm Workers of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Salinas Valley farm, entrepreneurs with Mountain View-based startup Blue River Technology are trying to show that the Lettuce Bot would not only replace two dozen workers, but also improve production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Using Lettuce Bot can produce more lettuce plants than doing it any other way,&quot; said Jorge Heraud, the company's co-founder and CEO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a lettuce field is planted, growers typically hire a crew of farmworkers who use hoes to remove excess plants to give space for others to grow into full lettuce heads. The Lettuce Bot uses video cameras and visual-recognition software to identify which lettuce plants to eliminate with a squirt of concentrated fertilizer that kills the unwanted buds while enriching the soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company, which raised $3 million from a major Silicon Valley venture capital firm for the Lettuce Bot, also plans to develop machines to automate weeding -- and eventually harvesting -- using many of the same technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another company, San Diego-based Vision Robotics, is developing a similar lettuce thinner as well as a pruner for wine grapes. The pruner uses robotic arms and cameras to photograph and create a computerized model of the vines, figure out the canes' orientation and the location of buds -- all to decide which canes to cut down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fresh fruit harvesting remains the biggest challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machines have proved not only clumsy, but inadequate in selecting ripe produce. In addition to blunders in deciphering color and feel, machines have a hard time distinguishing produce from leaves and branches. And most importantly, matching the dexterity and speed of farmworkers has proved elusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hand-eye coordination workers have is really amazing, and they can pick incredibly fast. To replicate that in a machine, at the speed humans do and in an economical manner, we're still pretty far away,&quot; said Daniel L. Schmoldt at the U.S. Agriculture Department's National Institute of Food and Agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In southern California, engineers with the Spanish company Agrobot are taking on the challenge by working with local growers to test a strawberry harvester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The machine is equipped with 24 arms whose movement is directed through an optical sensor; it allows the robot to make a choice based on fruit color, quality and size. The berries are plucked and placed on a conveyor belt, where the fruit is packed by a worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the harvester collects only strawberries that are hanging on the sides of the bed, hence California's strawberry fields would have to be reshaped to accommodate the machine, including farming in single rows, raising the beds and even growing varieties with fewer clusters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say it will take at least 10 years for harvesters to be available commercially for most fresh-market fruit -- not a moment too soon for farmers worried about the availability of workers, said Lupe Sandoval, managing director of the California Farm Labor Contractor Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you can put a man on the moon,&quot; Sandoval said, &quot;you can figure out how to pick fruit with a machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this Nov. 22, 1963 file photo, President John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy, arrive at Love Field airport in Dallas. (AP Photo/File)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anger seethes from the letter mailed to City Hall on Nov. 23, 1963, the day after the tragedy, raging that this city &quot;virtually invited the poor insignificant soul who blotted out the life of President Kennedy to do it in Dallas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dallas, the city of Hate; Dallas, the city of Shame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the nation and world mark this year's 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, special attention once again falls on the Texas metropolis. The &quot;hate/shame&quot; letter, which came from California and was one of many that poured in after the shooting, shows how the city instantly became a focus of fury, resentment and confusion, which locals have struggled with in the ensuing decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With scrutiny renewed by this year's milestone, Americans are learning again about the hostility toward Kennedy and his policies darkly voiced by some Dallasites before the assassination. The passing of five decades prompts new reflection on the city's tormented but evolving response to the crime here that changed history. And finally, many Americans wonder: How will Dallas mark that terrible day this year?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No longer are residents confronted by scorn when they tell people they're from Dallas - as then-Mayor Wes Wise was a decade after the assassination when asked by a fellow mayor how it felt to be the leader of &quot;the city that killed Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was a legacy that took time for the young city to come to terms with - a conundrum symbolized by its debate over the fate of the Texas School Book Depository, where Lee Harvey Oswald fired on the presidential motorcade from a sixth floor window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old depository building could have been razed but instead now houses the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, dedicated to telling the tale of that day unflinchingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The story of the museum is also the story of Dallas,&quot; said Stephen Fagin, associate curator. &quot;It's the story of the city and how the city has emerged from the long, dark shadow of history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this Nov. 22, 1963 file photo, President John F. Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy ride in the backseat of an open limousine on Main Street at Ervay Street in Dallas as the presidential motorcade approaches Dealey Plaza. Texas Gov. John Connally, and his wife Nellie are seated in the limousine's jump seats. (AP Photo/File)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome Mr. Kennedy to Dallas.&quot; That was the headline across a full-page advertisement in The Dallas Morning News on Nov. 22, 1963, as the president made his way to the city on a political fence-mending trip</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quick read made it clear the ad's greeting was sarcastic: It went on to ask a series of questions that implied he was a communist sympathizer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reading it, Kennedy quipped to first lady Jacqueline Kennedy that they were &quot;heading into nut country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just four weeks earlier, his United Nations ambassador, Adlai Stevenson, had been harangued by a group of ultra-conservatives as he spoke at a downtown auditorium. Frank McGehee, a Dallasite who had founded the anti-communist National Indignation Convention, shouted questions at Stevenson through a bullhorn until police took him away. Audience members loudly interrupted Stevenson's speech, and as he left, a woman bopped him on the head with a protest sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this Nov. 22, 1963 file photo, people line the street as the hearse bearing the body of slain U.S. President John F. Kennedy leaves Parkland Hospital in Dallas, to be flown to Washington, D.C. (AP Photo/File)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was headlines across the nation,&quot; recalled Darwin Payne, a professor emeritus of communications at Southern Methodist University who was a reporter at the Dallas Times Herald in 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three years earlier, during the 1960 presidential campaign, protesters accosted Kennedy's running mate Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird as they crossed a downtown Dallas street from one hotel to another. At a White House luncheon in 1961, Dallas Morning News publisher E. M. &quot;Ted&quot; Dealey, told Kennedy to his face that a &quot;man</SPAN></P>

Chambers Jr. of the rival Dallas Times Herald told Kennedy that Dealey's views didn't represent everyone. A war of editorials followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides McGehee's group, the anti-communist John Birch Society had an active chapter in Dallas. And the outspoken Maj. Gen. Edwin Walker, who resigned from the U.S. Army after being reprimanded for giving troops right-wing propaganda, settled in Dallas, where he flew the American flag upside down in front of his home.</SPAN></P>

(AP Photo/File)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-Kennedy fliers in the form of a &quot;Wanted&quot; poster with a mug shot-style portrait of the president appeared on the streets just before Kennedy's visit. Michael V. Hazel, historian of the city who was a high school sophomore in 1963, remembers his younger brother and a friend found such literature on the neighborhood sidewalk, leaving his family appalled. To most locals, Hazel said, &quot;I think those incidents seemed rather isolated and almost fringe-type things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But beyond the city, after the assassination, those incidents took on greater meaning to those looking for explanations. &quot;The city got branded with the 'City of Hate' because the extreme conservatives, the right wingers, had a following and they were good at getting publicity,&quot; said Gary Mack, curator of the Sixth Floor Museum, who added, &quot;A lot of people knew about them, but they didn't have a lot of followers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, as the president and first lady arrived in Dallas after buoyant stopovers in San Antonio, Houston and Fort Worth, bright skies and cheering throngs greeted them. As the motorcade made its way downtown, Kennedy even had his car stop so he could greet children who'd lined up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowd estimates range from 150,000 to 200,000 people, about a third of the population of the city at the time, said Mack, adding, &quot;When you look at the films and photographs, you cannot find more than two or three negative signs anywhere. There were nothing but cheers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wise, the future mayor who was a reporter with KRLD radio and television in 1963, agreed. He'd covered the Stevenson fracas, which was on his mind as Kennedy's motorcade left Dallas' Love Field. &quot;It was such a cheerful crowd that my fears kind of went away,&quot; Wise said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Near the end of its route, the motorcade approached the school book depository, located across from Dealey Plaza, a grassy area marking Dallas' birthplace in 1841. Texas first lady Nellie Connally, sitting beside her husband in front of the Kennedys in the limousine, recalled saying: &quot;Mr. President, you certainly cannot say that Dallas doesn't love you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rifle shots came moments later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As mayor at the time, Earle Cabell was on the receiving end of much of the criticism of Dallas that quickly followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letters from around the world are part of his papers housed at Southern Methodist University, one of the sponsors of a series of public programs to mark the anniversary.show more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One letter writer alluded to an &quot;insanity&quot; predominating the city and its politics, while another was incredulous that Oswald himself could have been fatally shot while being escorted by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oswald was not part of a far-right contingent (in fact, he had fired a shot at Gen. Walker in April 1963). He was a Marxist sympathizer who lived for a time in the Soviet Union, but his motive in the assassination remains murky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's one of the great tragedies of history that he and Kennedy would be on the same block at the same time, but it's not Dallas' fault,&quot; said historian Tim Naftali, a research fellow at the New America Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some letters to the city offered sympathy and support - and leaders began contemplating how to move forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stanley Marcus, who led the Dallas-based luxury retailer Neiman Marcus, wrote a paid editorial on New Year's Day 1964 titled &quot;What's Right with Dallas?&quot; that got widespread attention. He listed not only the city's positives - such as its business climate - but also noted areas where the city could improve, including a need to eradicate a &quot;spirit of 'absolutism.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in 1964, J. Erik Jonsson, co-founder of Texas Instruments, who succeeded Cabell as mayor, announced his &quot;Goals for Dallas&quot; initiative focusing on the future. Results included the new Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, kindergarten in public schools and other changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings called the program &quot;a healing process as well as a planning process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dozen years after the assassination, with her appointment as chairwoman of the Dallas County Historical Commission, Lindalyn Adams began spending time at county offices near Dealey Plaza and noticed something striking: the constant flow of people who came to see where the president was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I could see visitors, no matter whether it was icy cold, terribly warm, hot, or whatever, night or day in that area,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams herself had vivid memories of Nov. 22, 1963. Her husband, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology, had an office overlooking the emergency room at Parkland Memorial Hospital, where Kennedy was taken. They lived close enough to Love Field that she heard the engines rev up on Air Force One later that afternoon to return the body to Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was absolutely terrible on all levels,&quot; said Adams, a Dallas native, &quot;the fact the president was lost, the fact that it happened in our city, which we all loved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial attempts by the city to satisfy the grieving and curious who flocked to the site proved unsatisfying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November 1966, a plaque was installed in Dealey Plaza giving a basic narrative of events. Four years later, officials dedicated a cenotaph designed by architect Philip Johnson. This &quot;open tomb&quot; featuring only Kennedy's name etched in granite amid 30-foot-high concrete walls was confusing to many. Even the discussion of a memorial stirred debate, with some in Dallas suggesting it should have been installed instead in Washington, D.C., Fagin noted, &quot;because it was a painful memory that people here didn't want to think about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 1970, the Texas School Book Depository, the most visible reminder of the assassination, sat empty after the book company moved out. Following a push by a small group to buy the building and tear it down, the City Council passed an order in 1972 blocking demolition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, the building caught the eye of county officials looking for additional space. Adams, part of a group that toured the &quot;ghostlike, eerie&quot; structure, recalled taking a freight elevator up to the empty sixth floor and peering from the window that had been Oswald's sniper perch. &quot;I looked out of it for the first time and I thought, 'Oh my gosh, it's so close,'&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The county bought the building in 1977 and opened offices there in 1981, with the sixth and seventh floors remaining empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon, Adams embarked on a mission to convince Dallasites something should be put in place to explain what had happened there. She found an ally in Lee Jackson, who after being elected as Dallas County judge in 1986 noticed the &quot;persistent interest&quot; of tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They walked around the building taking pictures. They walked around the grassy knoll and the triple underpass and Dealey Plaza. They came inside and asked how they get up and when told no they tried anyway,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was clear there was a battle over the meaning of this place, Fagin said: between visitors from outside &quot;wanting somewhere to go to experience the history of the event ... versus the people of Dallas who were so frightened of this building becoming a shrine to Oswald or a further embarrassment to the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sixth floor finally opened to the public in 1989. Even then, however, it was simply called an exhibit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To have a full-fledged museum was too much to take at that time,&quot; Adams said, though it's long since been accredited as a museum and expects to get 350,000 visitors this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends now tell her: &quot;'Everyone who visits Dallas I take there. And I thought you were crazy. Thank you for doing it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, this process took time, said Edward T. Linenthal, a history professor at Indiana University and editor of the Journal of American History.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you have any kind of imagination it's a wormhole,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a place of great sadness but you're standing at a place where the world changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over time, Dallas has become more associated with the Dallas Cowboys football team and the television show &quot;Dallas,&quot; chronicling the scheming Ewing family, than with the assassination. But the 50th anniversary has prompted reflection throughout the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a counter to the &quot;City of Hate&quot; moniker, a nonprofit called 29 Pieces has teamed up with other organizations for the Dallas LOVE Project in which participants learn about Kennedy's legacy and create works of art expressing the &quot;love that lives in Dallas&quot; to be installed in the city, including along Kennedy's motorcade route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dallas Museum of Art has premiered a commemorative exhibit: It reunites many works of art that Fort Worth residents had lent to decorate the Kennedys' hotel room the night of their stay in that city. The Nasher Sculpture Center will host a concert featuring a musical composition commissioned for the occasion. The Sixth Floor Museum has embarked on a speaking series featuring people with ties to Nov. 22, 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city itself will mark the date with a solemn ceremony in Dealey Plaza featuring the tolling of church bells, a moment of silence and readings by historian David McCullough from Kennedy's speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to be very respectful,&quot; said Mayor Rawlings. &quot;We want to be very somber because it's a somber moment and have a sense of understated grace that I think this city has when it's at its best.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children who are punished through pushing, shoving and slapping are more likely to be obese and have other health problems when they grow up, a new study suggests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is one study that adds to a growing area of research that all has consistent findings that physical punishment is associated with negative mental and now physical (health) outcomes,&quot; said Tracie Afifi, who led the study at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, she and her colleagues published findings linking hitting and slapping in childhood to a higher risk of depression and anxiety later in life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the current report, they re-analyzed data collected in 2004 and 2005 by United States Census interviewers, who surveyed more than 34,000 adults across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants were asked whether their parents or other adults at home pushed, slapped, grabbed, shoved or hit them for punishment as a child. They also reported their current health conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1,300 people reported being physically punished at least &quot;sometimes&quot; without more extreme physical or emotional abuse or neglect. Compared to people who weren't punished physically as children, they were more likely to have been diagnosed with at least one chronic health condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, those participants were 25 percent more likely to have arthritis and 28 percent more likely to have cardiovascular disease - though the second finding could have been due to chance, the researchers wrote Monday in Pediatrics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More people who had been punished physically were obese: about 31 percent, versus 26 percent of those with no history of physical punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not every child who is slapped or pushed will develop mental or physical health problems, Afifi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But pain and inflammation from physical punishment, as well as psychological and behavioral responses to being hit, could lead to long-term problems for some children, she added.show more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Changes in sleep, risk-taking behaviors, immune functioning and regulation of stress hormones that result from chronic or intense stress may be important factors,&quot; Michele Knox, a psychiatrist who studies family and youth violence at the University of Toledo College of Medicine, commented in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't the safest method of discipline,&quot; Afifi told Reuters Health. &quot;Your child might be fine afterward, but maybe not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knox, who was not involved in the new research, told Reuters Health doctors should talk with parents about alternative, non-physical methods of discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we want what's best for our children, we need to choose discipline that does not come with these risks,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afifi said the point of the study is not to blame parents, or to say all discipline should be avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The recommendation against physical punishment does not imply the avoidance of discipline,&quot; she said. &quot;We're not saying, ' Just let your kid run wild.' &quot;5.Santa's Land saved, reopens By CHRIS MAYS / Reformer Staff</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUTNEY -- Santa's Land is saved!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's new owners, the Billewicz family, have been busy going over all the details and making sure everything's ready before the children's park was reopened earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They treat me really well here,&quot; said Santa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 7, Santa's Land was reopened to the public for seven days a week until Labor Day. After that, the park will be open weekends until Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One thing we have to respect is that we are not to change what has been tradition for the generations that have come before,&quot; said Lillian Billewicz. &quot;We want to leave it nostalgic, yet restore some of the attractions that need attention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billewicz had been following the story of Santa's Land since December 2011, when the park was about to be closed forever. She went to the park in February 2012 to check it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was zero degrees outside. In a buggy, she was driven around the 42-acre property in snow and sleet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw it while I was bumping around,&quot; she said. &quot;I saw something -- the potential.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billewicz told previous owners Tim and Lesley Wells that if they ever wanted to sell the park, they should contact her first. Billewicz was never notified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the fall of 2012, she saw Santa's Land was up for auction and it triggered a maternal instinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said, 'No, no, no. That's not going to happen,'&quot; Billewicz recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following two weeks, she and her two sons, Johnathan and Michael, began their attempts to save it from going to auction. show more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the major reasons for not wanting it to go to auction was that Santa's Land was included in a grandfather clause for zoning that it would lose if it went out to auction. The grandfather clause also stated that the park couldn't be closed for longer than a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since it was closed in 2011, it had to be reopened in 2012 or the grandfather clause would be lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doors were open but ownership was still up in the air. Volunteers met through Facebook on the &quot;Save Our Santa's Land&quot; page and the doors stayed open for a short time during 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From January up until a few weeks ago, the Billewicz family has been in contract negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since acquiring the park, friends and family have come up to the Putney property to assist with revitalizing some of the buildings and thoroughly cleaning the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is now a clothing store for infants and toddlers with all new products, where the arcade used to be. Pathways in the park are now lined with huge candy canes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old black train has been scraped down and redone. The sleighs have been repainted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New selections will be on the snack bar menu, which includes subs, kolbasi kabobs, chicken kabobs, shrimp kabobs, ice cream sundaes and banana splits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, 10 new fawns were born in the past two weeks, including with two sets of twins, in the deep park.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. President Barack Obama urged Americans to respect the decision of jurors on Sunday following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a case that has bitterly divided the country along racial and partisan lines since the boy was gunned down more than a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions,&quot; Obama said in a statement in which he referred to the slaying of the black 17-year-old as a &quot;tragedy&quot; for all of America. &quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's legal problems, however, seemed far from over a day after a jury of six Florida women cleared him of manslaughter and seconddegree murder charges - a verdict that stunned the black community and civil rights groups and spurred largely peaceful and protests in the streets in several U.S. cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury of six women accepted that Zimmerman had acted in self-defence when he shot and killed Martin as the teenager walked to his father's house in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., near Orlando, in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman had called the police after he spotted Trayvon at night, but ignored orders not to confront the teenager, who he believed was &quot;up to no good.&quot; A fight ensured during which he shot Martin dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a mortgage underwriter described during the trial as a &quot;wannabe cop,&quot; smiled briefly after the verdict was read out and was hugged by his mother and father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who were at the heart of the campaign for justice for their son, chose not to be in court on Saturday evening and spent Sunday morning in church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, said on Twitter: &quot;Et tu America?&quot; - a reference to the Latin phrase &quot;Et tu, Brute?&quot; known as an expression of betrayal. The Justice Department said in a statement on Sunday that it's investigating Martin's death to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman's been acquitted in the state case. The department launched a probe a year ago but stepped aside to allow Florida's prosecution to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents are also considering a wrongful-death civil suit against Zimmerman. Sixteen years ago, O.J. Simpson was ordered to pay $25 million in compensation to Nicole Brown Simpson's family members despite his infamous acquittal in criminal court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was walking to his father's house carrying a can of iced tea and a box of Skittles, when he was gunned down by Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer. Zimmerman claimed he shot the boy in selfdefence when Martin began beating on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country still smarting from a painful history of slavery and segregation, many blacks saw overt racism in Zimmerman's focus on a black boy wearing a hoodie as he walked through a gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict, many argued this weekend, proves the criminal justice system is still inherently biased against black people given Martin, the unarmed slaying victim, was successfully portrayed as the aggressor in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a slap in the face to those that believe in justice in this country,&quot; said Al Sharpton, the Baptist minister and civil rights activist who help to draw attention to the case after police initially released Zimmerman without charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What this jury has done is establish a precedent that when you are young and fit a certain profile, you can be committing no crime, just bringing some Skittles and iced tea home to your brother, and be killed and someone can claim self-defence. I think that this is an atrocity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Jealous, president of the NAACP, said Sunday, &quot;There may be a civil action brought by the family, but there should definitely be criminal charges brought by (the Department of Justice).</SPAN></P>
