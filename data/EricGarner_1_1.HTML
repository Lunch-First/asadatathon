<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEARS, SONGS AND SERMONS filled a Brooklyn church Wednesday as grief-stricken family and friends, along with politicians and civil rights leaders, said final goodbyes to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who died on a city street after an NYPD cop put him in a banned chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's teenage daughter brought sobs from the crowd as she sang Mariah Carey's ballad &quot;Hero&quot; to her father, followed by an emotional gospel tune from his 90-year-old aunt.His wife, Esaw (Pinky) Garner, and their children arrived in a stretch limo about 5:30 p.m. with a police escort. Garner's mother traveled behind them in her own stretch limo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simple floral arrangements surrounded the casket, including one in the shape of a crucifix on the right and a wreath on the left. At the foot of his coffin was a bouquet with a gold ribbon around it reading, &quot;Beloved Brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the stifling church, filled to capacity on a sticky, hot summer night, the 350-pound Garner lay in a white coffin inscribed with the words: &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in God's Care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was dressed in a white silk suit with a silk turquoise shirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those who came to pay their respects was Kadiatou Diallo, the mother of Amadou Diallo, who was fatally shot 19 times by cops in the Bronx 1999 when they mistook his wallet for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's just so sad. It brings back terrible memories. After all these cases and all these years, nothing seems to change,&quot; she told the Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It should never have happened, it should have been prevented,&quot; she added of Garner's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm calling on the new administration, Mayor de Blasio and (Police) Commissioner (Bill) Bratton, to bring about changes,&quot; Diallo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esaw Garner and two of her sons entered Bethel Baptist Church in Boerum Hill wearing white slacks and turquoise silk shirts that matched those Garner wore in his casket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grieving woman had to be helped to the altar to take a last look at her beloved spouse. She collapsed clutching the dead man's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My God, they took him. They took my baby. They took my baby,&quot; she sobbed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members carried her to the front pew, where she was able to nod and shake hands as she received a steady stream of condolences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to miss him so much,&quot; she said, fanning herself in the sweltering heat. &quot;He cared for everybody. He didn't deserve this.`</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was supposed to be my rock,&quot; she said breaking down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now he is gone. He will never answer my call. I just want to cry,&quot; she said, slumping into the arms of Gwen Carr, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My son, my son, I love him so,&quot; Carr said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, 43, died last Thursday as cops tried to cuff him for allegedly selling bootleg cigarettes on a Staten Island sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cell phone recording captured the asthmatic father of six repeating the words: &quot;I can't breathe!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One cop can be seen putting Garner in a chokehold, a move prohibited by the NYPD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, who spoke at Garner's funeral, brought mourners to their feet when he announced that he and the family will meet with Justice Department attorneys Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is how we get action. We can't live in the a city where they can choke us out and it's not a big thing,&quot; Sharpton thundered from the pulpit, to wild cheers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't need retraining, you don't need sensitizing,&quot; Sharpton said, referring to Bratton's decision to retrain all his officers in use of force practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a difference this time, this time there's a video. You can't tell no lies this time,&quot; Sharpton said, calling Raymond Ortiz, who captured Garner's death on a cell phone, to the front of the room for a round of applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical examiner's office hasn't yet determined a cause of death for Garner, but a preliminary investigation found no clear signs of asphyxiation, police sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner had a history with police and can be seen on the video waving his arms and yelling at them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time you see me you want to mess with me,&quot; Garner told the cops. &quot;I'm tired of it. It stops today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Staten Island district attorney's office Wednesday dropped cases against Garner from 2013 and earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had been charged with possession or sale of untaxed cigarettes and possession of marijuana.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NYPD COP who put </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a chokehold was the subject of a Civilian Complaint Review Board probe on allegations he strip-searched two men in public and slapped their genitals, documents obtained by the Daily News show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darren Collins, 46, and Tommy Rice, 43, filed papers against Officer Daniel Pantaleo with the CCRB in 2012, claiming he &quot;slapped&quot; and &quot;tapped&quot; their testicles in broad daylight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo and three other plainclothes cops pulled over their Nissan Maxima about 10:50 a.m. on March 22, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops claimed to have witnessed a hand-to-hand drug deal involving the men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After they got out of the vehicle, the men told the review board, &quot;PO Pantaleo then removed Mr. Rice's belt, causing Mr. Rice's pants to sag down to the middle of his thigh. ... PO Pantaleo pulled Mr. Rice's pants down to his knees and then pulled his boxer shorts down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo then slapped Rice's private parts, the documents allege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pantaleo stated that he was attempting to shake out any contraband Mr. Rice might be hiding,&quot; the documents allege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins provided CCRB investigators with a similar account of the strip search. No drugs were found on either Collins or Rice, but a third person in the car was in possession of heroin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo denied the allegations.The men's claim was deemed unsubstantiated - it could not be proved or disproved - because it was the word of Collins and Rice against cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal charges against Rice and Collins were dismissed and they settled a federal lawsuit for $15,000 each this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CCRB substantiated 23 complaints against cops in Pantaleo's 120th Precinct between 2009 and 2013 - the second-highest number citywide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds from the Gowanus Houses, where Garner grew up, and relatives from Staten Island packed into Bethel Baptist Church in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, to pay their respects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, 43, died last Thursday as cops tried to cuff him for allegedly selling bootleg cigarettes on a Staten Island sidewalk. A cell phone recording captured the asthmatic father of six repeating the words: &quot;I can't breathe!&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton arrived at 8 p.m. to deliver his remarks in honor of Garner.</SPAN></P>

Garner, 43, died last Thursday afternoon after a cop named Daniel Pantaleo applied a chokehold to his neck in Tompkinsville, Staten Island, as he was being arrested for suspicion of selling &quot;loosies&quot; cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women had come to pay their respects to Garner, whose senseless death, recorded on video, has galvanized the city. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The video where the paramedic takes his pulse and does nothing else is just as disgusting as the one where the cop kills him,&quot; said a Pace University nursing student who preferred anonymity, but who sported an American Red Cross T-shirt with the legend: &quot;Help Save Lives, Choose Your Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She didn't even perform CPR or give mouth to mouth,&quot; said the student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They just killed him and let him lay there,&quot; said Mary Hickman, a Garner family friend. &quot;That cop who choked him gotta go. They all gotta go. I was with Eric's wife last night in Staten Island. . . . She's realizing that Eric's gone forever now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't put the paddles on his chest to bring him back to life,&quot; said a home nursing aide who also preferred to remain nameless. &quot;Nothing. If that was a cop who was lying on the ground, they would have done everything to revive him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the angry voices echoing across the city in response to the two shocking videos of Garner's death. The one with the chokehold is like a snuff movie. The second one of the indifferent police and paramedics and the chokehold cop, Pantaleo, waving in a gloating way as Garner lies lifeless on the sidewalk shows an almost sociopathic abuse of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are pictures of truth,&quot; says Garner family lawyer Sanford Rubenstein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's clear that there still exists in the NYPD a hard-core, old-school fringe minority of cowboy cops who think this is pre-Knapp Commission New York City, where you could mistreat &quot;perps, skells and mutts&quot; committing the most minor offenses like protesters in Tiananmen Square. This time, the &quot;perp&quot; died in living color. Inside the church, mourners filed past the gleaming white casket where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lay in a brilliant white suit amid bouquets of gorgeous white roses - as if celebrating his bright, short, happy life instead of his dark violent death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I called him Big Man,&quot; says Trish McClean, wearing a T-shirt scrawled with graffiti memorializing Garner's life and death, including &quot;I Can't Breathe,&quot; the words he repeated as the cops held him down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big Man was my best friend. . . . He was the happiest, gentlest, most generous guy around. And they just killed him on suspicion of selling Newports. He wasn't selling no Newports. But they assumed he was, and for that they put Big Man in a chokehold that put him in that coffin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chokehold has been banned by the NYPD for two decades, but here comes this eight-year veteran Pantaleo, who is in absolutely no immediate physical danger on the video, chokeholding Garner from behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the old days of Brooklyn, where Garner was raised and was now having his funeral, my older brothers used to send me to Mr. B's candy store for three loosies. This was in the 72nd Precinct, where we had a cop named Tommy Doyle who was the sheriff of Park Slope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Doyle caught you drinking beer underage, he'd confiscate it and say, &quot;Scram. I'll be back in 15 minutes. If any of yiz are still here, you're going through the f---ing system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'd scram.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thought about Doyle when I watched that video of Pantaleo choking Garner. I wondered what would have happened if a seasoned cop like Doyle had said, &quot;Eric, scram. If you're here in 15 minutes, you're going into the system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> probably would have gone home to his wife, Pinky, who was watching &quot;The People's Court,&quot; porkchops simmering on the stove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> six kids would still have a father today, instead of a corpse in a white casket heading for the cemetery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NYPD COP who put </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a chokehold allegedly strip-searched two men in public following a traffic stop, according to documents obtained by the Daily News. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darren Collins and Tommy Rice filed papers against Officer Daniel Pantaleo with the Civilian Complaint Review Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their filing, Collins, 46, and Rice, 43, said Pantaleo also &quot;slapped&quot; and &quot;tapped&quot; their testicles in broad daylight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo and three other plainclothes cops pulled over their Nissan Maxima about 10:50 a.m. on March 22, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops claimed to have witnessed a hand-to-hand drug deal involving the men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After they exited their vehicle, the men told the review board, &quot;PO Pantaleo then removed Mr. Rice's belt, causing Mr. Rice's pants to sag down to the middle of his thigh. PO Pantaleo pulled Mr. Rice's pants down to his knees and then pulled his boxer shorts down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo then slapped Rice's private parts, the documents allege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pantaleo stated that he was attempting to shake out any contraband Mr. Rice might be hiding,&quot; the documents allege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins provided the Civilian Complaint Review Board investigators with a similar account of the strip search. No drugs were found on either Collins or Rice, but a third person in the car was in possession of heroin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo denied he pulled down anyone's pants or underwear or touched their testicles, according to the documents. In the end, the allegation was deemed unsubstantiated - it could not be proved or disproved - because it was the word of Collins and Rice against the cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal charges against Rice and Collins were later dismissed. They settled a federal lawsuit for $15,000 each this year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mourners trickled slowly into the crowded church. Inside, a huge man lay in a white casket topped by white and yellow flowers -- a man who in life was known to few outside his Staten Island neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In death, though, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has become a symbol of policing gone awry: He was videotaped as he was put into an apparent chokehold by police officers. His case has jolted a city that began the year with a new mayor, Bill de Blasio, and a new police commissioner, William J. Bratton, vowing better lives for people such as Garner: black men living far from the glassy skyscrapers and shaded brownstones of the well-heeled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders and other New Yorkers say Garner's death July 17 shows the need for faster change in the New York Police Department. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in all five boroughs are fired up. They're fired up right now because we don't like this,&quot; said Isaac L. Mickens, a pastor, community activist and friend of Garner's family. &quot;We need action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the service in a Brooklyn church, a public viewing drew friends of Garner, civic leaders and strangers who knew of his death only through the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earl Simms was among the friends. &quot;I just saw him last Wednesday,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simms wiped away tears and sweat as he stood outside on the sweltering 90-degree day after passing by the casket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm quite certain that when he woke up Thursday, he didn't expect this to happen,&quot; Simms said, speculating that officers were intimidated by Garner's size and motivated by racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The racial profiling has to stop,&quot; said Simms, who is black and had known Garner five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now, the story of Garner's death is well-known. The 43-year-old father of six, who according to various media reports weighed 350 to 400 pounds, was asthmatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had a history of arrests for selling untaxed cigarettes in his working-class neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the afternoon of July 17, witnesses say, Garner had broken up a street fight between two other men when police approached him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness with a video camera recorded what happened next: Garner telling officers to leave him alone; police moving closer as Garner, sounding increasingly panicked, tried to avoid being handcuffed and said, &quot;Don't touch me, don't touch me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One officer approached him from behind and wrapped an arm around his neck. Three other officers joined in restraining Garner, who fell to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someone pushed his face into the sidewalk. &quot;I can't breathe. I can't breathe,&quot; Garner said, his voice becoming more muffled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within an hour, he was dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police released a statement shortly afterward saying Garner had gone into cardiac arrest as officers tried to arrest him on suspicion of selling illegal cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's relatives say that despite his health problems he would be alive if police had not piled onto him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That little bit of breath he had, they took it from him,&quot; Garner's sister Ellisha Flagg said during a march on Staten Island on Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of Garner's death, Bratton announced a &quot;top-to-bottom review&quot; of training of New York's more than 30,000 police officers, especially in use of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton, who headed the Los Angeles Police Department from 2002 to 2009 and is credited with reforms that reduced crime and improved community relations, said he would invoke those tactics to revamp the NYPD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton has said the grip that the police officer, Daniel Pantaleo, used on Garner &quot;appeared to have been a chokehold,&quot; which would make it illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio, who was elected on promises to close the gaps between rich and poor, black and white, said he found the video of Garner's death &quot;very troubling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I watched it the same way a family member would watch it, and it was very sad,&quot; said De Blasio, who was highly critical of what he considered racially biased police tactics under Bratton's predecessor, Raymond Kelly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo's gun and badge have been taken away pending results of an investigation, and a second officer who was at the scene has been put on desk duty. Four emergency medical workers who witnesses say did not try to revive Garner have been suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton said Tuesday that he did not believe race had anything to do with what happened to Garner. Instead, he said, the incident underscored the need for better officer training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mourners disagreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flagg speculated that police assumed the worst about her brother when they saw him standing on the street in his wrinkled shorts and T-shirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was discriminated&quot; against, she said. &quot;They might have thought he didn't have nobody or a family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mickens said that whatever the officers' motivation, the fact that Garner was making a living selling illegal cigarettes on the street showed that the city has far to go in bridging its income gap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for what should happen to the officer who put his arm around Garner's neck, Mickens said, &quot;He should be locked up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK'S top cop on Tuesday ordered his 35,000 officers retrained in the use of force as an incensed lawmaker called the death of a dad placed in a banned chokehold &quot;murder.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As cries for justice resounded on the steps of City Hall over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demise in police custody, an autopsy on the asthmatic father of six proved inconclusive, and a spokeswoman for the medical examiner said further tests would be needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was a murder,&quot; state Sen. Bill Perkins declared at a City Hall rally. &quot;Without even being arrested, he was choked to death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, 43, died after being taken down by cops, allegedly for selling bootleg cigarettes on a Staten Island sidewalk. A cell phone video shot by a witness shows him repeatedly pleading &quot;I can't breathe&quot; after being placed in a chokehold by a cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident has prompted a criminal investigation by the Staten Island district attorney and reviews by other agencies. The NYPD banned chokeholds in 1994 after a Bronx man, Anthony Baez, was killed by an officer who placed him in one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Councilman Jumaane Williams (D-Brooklyn) blasted the &quot;omissions and lies&quot; in an internal police report on Garner's case detailed in a Daily News front page story Tuesday. The report failed to mention the chokehold and downplayed Garner's distress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's Citizen Complaint Review Board revealed Tuesday that two people have lodged complaints against NYPD cops in the wake of Garner's death for placing them in chokeholds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an afternoon press conference, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton called Garner's death &quot;very tragic&quot; and ordered Deputy Commissioner of Training Benjamin Tucker to conduct a &quot;top-to-bottom&quot; review of instruction on the use of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This department clearly needs to do more training,&quot; said Bratton, adding that he anticipates &quot;a retraining of every member of the New York Police Department.&quot; To that end, he plans to dispatch a team to look at using the Los Angeles Police Department's &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; training as a template.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton was the LAPD chief when the new training policies were put in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton, who met with community and religious leaders Tuesday to discuss the Garner incident and also huddled with police brass in Staten Island, emphasized that Garner's death will not affect his commitment to &quot;broken windows&quot; policing, which cracks down on petty crimes like selling bootleg cigarettes. Bratton vowed it will remain a &quot;key part&quot; of his game plan.The commissioner, who met with local FBI officials about the incident, said he anticipated a civil suit by Garner's family and &quot;would not be surprised if the U.S. attorney decides to open a civil rights violation investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred people held a vigil Tuesday night in a park near where Garner died, then marched to the 120th Precinct stationhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody deserves to die like that, not even a police officer,&quot; Garner's sister, Ellisha Flagg, said on the steps of the precinct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK'S top cop on Tuesday ordered the retraining of his 35,000 officers in the use of force as an incensed lawmaker called the death of a dad put in a banned chokehold &quot;murder.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As protests and cries for justice resounded on the steps of City Hall over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demise in police custody, an autopsy on the asthmatic father of six proved &quot;inconclusive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was a murder,&quot; state Sen. Bill Perkins declared at a City Hall rally. &quot;Without even being arrested, he was choked to death. It's outrageous. It's unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, 43, died after being taken down by cops, allegedly for selling bootleg cigarettes on a Staten Island sidewalk. A cell phone video shot by a witness shows him repeatedly pleading &quot;I can't breathe&quot; after being placed in a chokehold by a cop and piled on top of by other officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident has prompted a criminal investigation by the Staten Island district attorney and reviews by other agencies. The NYPD banned chokeholds in 1994 after a Bronx man, Anthony Baez, was killed by an officer who placed him in one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jumaane Williams (D-Brooklyn) blasted the &quot;omissions and lies&quot; in an internal police report on Garner's case detailed in a Daily News front page story Tuesday. The report failed to mention the chokehold and downplayed Garner's distress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's Citizen Complaint Review Board revealed Tuesday that two people have lodged complaints against NYPD cops for using chokeholds on them in the wake of Garner's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an afternoon press conference, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton called Garner's death &quot;very tragic&quot; and ordered Deputy Commissioner of Training Benjamin Tucker to conduct a &quot;top-to-bottom&quot; review of instruction on the use of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This department clearly needs to do more training,&quot; Bratton said. He anticipates &quot;a retraining of every member of the New York Police Department.&quot; To that end, he plans to dispatch a team to look at using the LAPD's &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; training as a template.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton spent part of Tuesday meeting with community and religious leaders to discuss the Garner incident, and he headed over to Staten Island to meet with police brass there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He vowed the probe into Garner's death will be &quot;thorough and comprehensive,&quot; but also that it will take time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton said he met with local FBI officials, saying, &quot;I would not be surprised if the U.S. attorney decides to open a civil rights violation investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's anticipating civil suit brought by Garner's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An autopsy performed on Garner, who was asthmatic and obese, failed to determine a cause of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred people held a vigil Tuesday night in a park near where Garner died, then marched to the 120th Precinct stationhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody deserves to die like that, not even a police officer,&quot; Garner's sister, Ellisha Flagg, said on the steps of the precinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's funeral will be held 7 p.m. Wednesday at Bethel Baptist Church in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the outrage over last week's death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IG Philip Eure requested hundreds of NYPD and the Civilian Complaint Review Board files. The CCRB has received 1,022 complaints alleging chokeholds since 2009, of which only nine were deemed &quot;substantiated.&quot; Of those, only one resulted in any significant punishment, despite the NYPD having barred chokeholds since 1993. The CCRB deemed 462 of the complaints worthy of full investigation; 206 were &quot;unsubstantiated&quot; but will be reviewed by Eure. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops heard </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cry that he couldn't breathe, a recording captured officers violently taking him to the ground and even Mayor de Blasio said he believes the asthmatic father of six was put in a chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an NYPD internal report prepared right after his death on Staten Island last Thursday plays down the incident, with supervising officers failing to note the chokehold and insisting Garner was not in &quot;great distress.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sgt. Dhanan Saminath told interviewers that the 43-year-old cigarette peddler was in cuffs with cops &quot;maintaining control of him&quot; and that he &quot;did not appear to be in great distress,&quot; the preliminary report obtained by the Daily News shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sgt. Kizzy Adonis told investigators probing the death that &quot;the perpetrator's condition did not seem serious and that he did not appear to get worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite those words, Adonis also said she &quot;believed she heard the perpetrator state that he was having difficulty breathing,&quot; the report states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness who talked to investigators told of a more violent scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taisha Allen, 36, said she saw the two officers take Garner &quot;by the arms and put him on the ground&quot; and that he &quot;struck his head and shoulder on the ground and was telling the officers he couldn't breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also said an officer in a green shirt - Daniel Pantaleo - &quot;had his knee on Mr. Garner's back and was ordering him to put his hands behind his back.&quot; He's the officer who appears to put Garner in a chokehold while taking him down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even from Italy, de Blasio said he was fairly sure what transpired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As an individual who's no expert in law enforcement, it looked like a chokehold to me,&quot; de Blasio told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he didn't want to comment on what he thought should happen to the officers involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I . . . emphasize that you need a full investigation, because all sides need to be heard and all evidence looked at,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Videos of the incident show Garner telling police he can't breathe - and then show him on the ground for several minutes, apparently unconscious and unresponsive to police commands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, 65, told The News she's relieved there were recordings so cops couldn't cover up what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want him to have died in vain,&quot; she said. &quot;As people see, it's just a godsend that we have the video. Just look at the tape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carr said she wants those responsible thrown in jail &quot;just as they would had given my son if the shoe was on the other foot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carr, heartbroken by her son's death, also questioned why none of the cops or rescue workers on hand attempted CPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's just a lack of humanity,&quot; she said. &quot;That's what it was. He was nothing to them, but he was our people. He was just a big guy on the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses told investigators that Garner, who weighed 350 pounds, had just broken up a dispute when cops arrived and accused him of passing a cigarette to someone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner denied that he was illegally selling smokes as he struggled with the cops, the recording of the incident shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source said the cops had to use three sets of handcuffs to secure Garner. He was then loaded onto a stretcher and at some point, went into cardiac arrest, the report states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police source said cops found four full packs and one partial pack of Newports on Garner, who had a long history of selling untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo's gun and shield were taken away and he and Officer Justin Damico were both put on desk duty pending the results of an internal investigation, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two EMTs and two paramedics have been suspended without pay, according to a Richmond University Medical Center spokeswoman. A source identified the EMTs as Nicole Palmeri and Stephanie Greenberg.The internal NYPD report also points out that Damico, Pantaleo and two other cops were prevented from being interviewed for the preliminary report because of a possible criminal investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video shows at least a half dozen cops at the scene moments after the takedown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical examiner's office said a preliminary study found no signs of asphyxiation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD prohibited the use of chokeholds in 1993. The city's independent police watchdog has substantiated 10 chokehold cases filed against cops since 2009, but little has happened to the officers involved, records show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of the cases, the cop accused of putting a person in a chokehold lost up to 10 vacation days, records from the Civilian Complaint Review Board show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In two cases, the department declined to discipline the officers, and in three cases, cops received &quot;instructions,&quot; or retraining. In another case, the cop retired before he could be disciplined, and the three remaining cases are pending, the records show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 24 hours after the incident, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said that it appeared that Garner was put in a chokehold.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watching the brutal video of the police bringing down </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, never to get up again, I though about Mo and his cousins at the Ditmas Park bodega I bought my loosies from for years. They're part of the neighborhood, keeping an eye on the street and watching out for their neighbors. They don't sell to strangers, to avoid fines or losing their license to sell smokes, but they don't worry about getting arrested, let alone killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a permanent tension, that in rightly focusing their efforts where crime is highest, police can easily make criminals of the people they're charged with protecting, and upping the opportunities for the sort of ugly encounters that leave scars, or worse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, who had a lengthy record for selling loosies and other petty things, was someone who the cops and EMTs Thursday plainly saw as a skell - even as the people from his neighborhood now mourning him describe someone very different, a good-natured father of six who, like Mo, helped break up fights and keep an eye on his street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ton back to serve a second stint as When Mayor de Blasio brought Bill Bratpolice commissioner, he gave a double mandate: keep crime down to its current record low, and give a peace dividend to the people in high-crime neighborhoods after a decade in which over-reliance on stops and frisks left too many decent citizens in dangerous neighborhoods resentful of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains to be seen if those are compatible goals. With the number of stops having plummeted, Bratton has relied, as he did in his first stint as commissioner under Rudy Giuliani, on broken windows policing - the idea that going after small crimes or signs of disorder helps stop larger ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bratton first took the job, in 1994, there had been 2,420 murders the previous year. Last year, there were 333. Some things that couldn't be overlooked back then perhaps should be now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But so far Bratton, as Kelly did before him, has pressed cops to keep the pressure up and the numbers down. With less serious crime, that means a lot of interactions between police officers and people who've done nothing much, or nothing at all, wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To enforce the law on our behalf, we empower the police to use force and, no matter how well trained they are, every encounter has a chance of going wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's crucial police are focused on laws that matter, and enforcing them fairly. But right now, there's a &quot;common sense&quot; standard about who and what warrants police attention, with all the potential for violence, arrests and more that brings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Open-air drinking isn't allowed, but no one thinks twice about uncorking wine at Bryant Park movie nights. As I wrote about pot last week, the same thing can't be a crime in East Flatbush, but okay in Ditmas Park, or for a black kid but not his white pal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Bratton really wants to bring the temperature down, he may need to simply have police make fewer arrests for small things, and find other ways to ensure his officers remain active in dealing with real crimes. That is, treat people in every park like they're in Bryant Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the truth is that if that happens, crime is likely to go up some - and this newspaper and many New Yorkers will bitterly protest any upward tick, as will the victims of those crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I don't want New York to be Singapore, where people get caned for spitting gum on the sidewalk, any more than I want it to go back to the murder peak of the late 1980s. That it must be one or the other is, obviously, a false choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, many of the advocates now calling for Bratton's head are reflexive critics of all policing. But the commissioner and mayor need to decide how much enforcement they want, for how much crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a point at which aggressive policing makes criminals of people for committing harmless acts - drinking in a park, say, or smoking a joint on their stoop or even just jaywalking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops and civilians engage in millions of encounters a year, each with a small chance of going wrong. How many don't may be underappreciated. But every needless one risks another Garner. And with every phone a camera now, there's no hiding the violence when it happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As George Kelling, the co-author of the original broken windows article and a consultant to Bratton, told me last week, the point of quality-of-life enforcement was never to criminalize people, but to keep order and shift behavior: &quot;We were never interested in a mounting number of arrests.&quot; That's right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people that own stores sell illegal cigarettes,&quot; said Ellisha Flagg, Garner's sister. &quot;They lose their license, not their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE GRIEVING son of a man who died after an NYPD officer put him in a chokehold said Sunday he wants to see the cop behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> son, Eric Snipes, 18, spoke out just hours after four emergency workers who responded to Thursday's tragic scene in Staten Island were put on modified duty pending an investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snipes focused his anger on Officer Daniel Pantaleo, the plainclothes cop seen in a viral video putting Garner in a chokehold banned by the NYPD and refusing to let up even when the father of six repeatedly yelled he couldn't breathe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He should be in jail. No protective custody, either. Put in the (general) population,&quot; Snipes said of Pantaleo, who has been yanked from the streets along with Officer Justin Damico as the investigation into the death of the 350-pound cigarette peddler continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's son said he and his family are still grappling with the senselessness of the death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to ask the man that did it, 'What made you choke him like that?' &quot; Snipes said. &quot;What made him put his hand around his bare neck?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snipes also recalled his dad's last words to him the night before he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was telling me how he was proud of me . . . the first person in my family to go to college,&quot; said Snipes, who begins classes at Essex County College in Newark this fall on a basketball scholarship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the outcry over Garner's death continued, four emergency workers were put on modified duty, an FDNY spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EMTs are not Fire Department employees, said agency spokesman Jim Long, but are employed by Richmond University Medical Center - two from its advanced life support unit and two from its basic life support unit. The FDNY did not identify them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four have been banned from responding to calls - at least until the investigation is completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Word of the action against the emergency workers came a day after video footage from the scene showed at least eight cops standing idly by as Garner was sprawled, motionless, on the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emergency workers arrived four minutes into the seven-minute clip, yet performed no CPR nor gave Garner oxygen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One emergency worker checked Garner's pulse and told the apparently lifeless man that help had arrived. Cops and the worker lifted Garner onto a stretcher and he was taken to a Staten Island hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton slammed what he called the inhumanity of the officers who gave no aid to Garner, who was being arrested on suspicion of illegally selling cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;None of them said, 'Let's stop. He can't breathe,' &quot; Sharpton told a packed house at the historic Riverside Church. &quot;Even if police procedures don't kick in, when does your sense of humanity kick in? Have we gotten so cold?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Famed pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht said Garner could have survived had he been placed upright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want to position him in a way to facilitate breathing,&quot; said Wecht.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources told the Daily News that a preliminary report found no signs of neck trauma, such as a crushed windpipe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, 43, died after one officer put him in a chokehold and other cops helped bring him down after his arrest Thursday in Tompkinsville. He repeatedly called out, &quot;I can't breathe,&quot; then went still, as bystanders videotaped the tragic incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emergency workers are not Fire Department employees, FDNY spokesman Jim Long said. They are volunteer workers from Richmond University Medical Center - two from its advanced life support unit and two from its basic life support unit. The FDNY did not identify them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A khaki-clad Mayor de Blasio arrived in Rome Sunday to begin his eight-day family vacation, a day later than scheduled following the death of a Staten Island man in police custody last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio, First Lady Chirlane McCray, and their kids Dante and Chiara - sporting a new hairdo - landed at the Leonardo da Vinci airport shortly before 11 a.m. local time after flying coach on an overnight flight from Kennedy Airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relaxed mayor, who often speaks proudly of his Italian heritage, came out of customs pushing a roller suitcase and greeted reporters waiting for him at the terminal with a hearty &quot;buongiorno!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was supposed to arrive Saturday, but delayed the trip after the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cause of his death is still under investigation, but an officer put the 43-year-old father in a chokehold, which is prohibited under NYPD policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio said it was important to tend to the matter in New York before leaving for the multicity tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I spoke to a variety of community leaders, elected officials, clergy from Staten Island and around the city to get a sense of what people were feeling, what they thought we should do going forward,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought it was very important to consult them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vacation will provide some much-needed family time, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time with family is crucial and precious in life, and for the last couple of years that's been hard to come by,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, his first full day in Italy, he will meet with Italian government officials, as well as the Vatican's secretary of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His office tried to work out a meeting with Pope Francis, but the Catholic leader's schedule couldn't fit him in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio also took time out Sunday to visit with Rome Mayor Ignazio Marino, a surgeon-turned-politician who took office last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two left-leaning pols had a private meeting at the stately Palazzo Senatorio, the Rome equivalent of City Hall. It overlooks a piazza designed by Michelangelo and is located on the Capitoline Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm obviously honored and pleased to welcome Bill, Chirlane, Chiara and Dante,&quot; Rome's mayor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During their meeting, Marino said they talked about big issues like immigration and income inequality, as well as the more local concerns that mayors face, like mass transit and sanitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing they didn't talk about was Rome's thriving horse-and-carriage industry. Marino said the subject never came up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio is well known in Italy. His Election Night victory last November was broadcast live in Sant'Agata de'Goti, the small town outside Naples where his family came from, and he is widely seen as a symbol of Italian success in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His photogenic family also appears to have captured the interest of the Italian media. During the stop at Rome's municipal headquarters, many of the local photographers screamed out &quot;Chiara&quot; and &quot;Dante&quot; in hopes of getting the kids to look their way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fashion-conscious Chiara arrived in Italy sporting a new hairdo that featured multiple mini-buns, reminiscent of the Icelandic singer Bjork.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the new 'do, Chiara laughed and said, &quot;No comment.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wecht, who has been a consultant in several high-profile cases including JonBenet Ramsey and Anna Nicole Smith, said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should have been immediately placed upright. &quot;You want to position him in such a way to facilitate breathing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,000 city residents have accused the NYPD of putting them in chokeholds in the past five years, the Civilian Complaint Review Board said Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The startling numbers were revealed as new CCRB Chair Richard Emery said the board plans to conduct a &quot;comprehensive study&quot; of chokehold complaints and find out why cops are apparently still using the forbidden practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chokehold study will be an &quot;agency priority,&quot; according to CCRB Executive Director Tracy Catapano-Fox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of July 1, the CCRB had received 58 chokehold complaints against the NYPD this year, but had only substantiated one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of the 1,022 chokehold allegations reported between 2008 and 2013, only 462 of the complaints were investigated. Out of that number, just nine were substantiated, according to the CCRB.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE HEARTBREAKING details were all too vivid for Iris Baez: the cops, the outnumbered victim, the chokehold, the motionless body on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It brings up everything like it was yesterday,&quot; said Baez, whose son Anthony died on Dec. 22, 1994, when a game of street football escalated into tragedy outside her Bronx home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It brings up so much of the wound and it opens up everything all over again. This heartbreak keeps happening.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baez spoke Saturday to the Daily News, just two days after the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43. He died after a Staten Island cop wrapped a forearm around his throat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They keep on doing the same thing as before,&quot; she lamented. &quot;Like they can do anything they want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Baez - an asthmatic, like Garner - was tossing a football with his brothers just three days before Christmas and the pigskin accidentally hit a nearby police car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baez, 29, stepped in when police grabbed his kid brother, and was mortally injured as cops tried to arrest him for disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Orlando man was visiting for the holidays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family charged an enraged cop choked Anthony unconscious, and then left him lying in the street for 10 minutes before taking him to a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baez was dead on arrival. Garner, too, was declared dead at a nearby hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This young man didn't kill himself,&quot; Iris Baez said of Garner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They put an illegal chokehold on him. . . . He was clearly (saying), 'I can't breathe! I can't breathe!' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While five officers were involved in the Garner case, Anthony Baez was subdued by a half-dozen cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iris Baez read about the death in the Daily News, while both her son and daughter called after hearing what happened on the news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she refused to watch the viral video obtained by The News that captured the arrest and its aftermath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I chose not to,&quot; she explained. &quot;I already imagine what that man went through from when my son went through it. I could just figure it out, the same way they took him down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He took him down with an illegal chokehold. He couldn't breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She later attended a Saturday morning Harlem rally where Garner's wife, mother, sister and daughter turned out for support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're here for them,&quot; Baez told The News before heading to the event. &quot;Hopefully, we can unite . . . and be there just to give support. I sympathize with you and I'm there for you because I've been there - and I know what it is and I know what it feels like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The horrors of that December day are never far off for Iris Baez - she still lives in the same home on Anthony Baez Place, renamed to honor the memory of her son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The holidays remain particularly hard almost two decades later, and Baez predicted Garner's family - particularly his six kids - will suffer the same pain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At Christmas, my son used to love to dress up for the kids,&quot; she recounted. &quot;Now, when Christmas comes, we don't have a Santa Claus anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, little things,&quot; Baez continued. &quot;At dinner, he loved the drumsticks of the turkey. Those little things are here with me for life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was also upset that cops escalated what started as a simple arrest for allegedly selling untaxed single cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He didn't lunge at the police,&quot; she said. &quot;He didn't have a knife, he didn't have a gun. Why couldn't the police negotiate with him? . . . If he needed a ticket, then give him the damn ticket and leave him alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Francis Livoti did seven years in federal prison for violating Anthony's civil rights after a state trial ended in his acquittal for criminally negligent homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iris Baez hopes the officers involved in Garner's death pull even stiffer sentences if they're charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have to bring someone to justice because they committed a crime,&quot; she said. &quot;I say the officer who choked him should get 25 to life. That's the minimum he should get.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No way can you look at that video of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> being yoked in a chokehold from behind by a plainclothes coward without saying this guy belongs in an orange jumpsuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's like watching a snuff film. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That two-bit bar bouncer with a badge needs to be bum-rushed off the NYPD and indicted for manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other cops who pounced on Garner as he pleaded for his life like a drowning man should also be charged. And the ones who stood by and did nothing should also be investigated for dereliction of duty because they are witnessing a crime in progress of a man being abused with excessive force without trying to stop it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That video obtained by the Daily News is disturbing proof of how far we have not come since Rodney King and Abner Louima and the last election where Bill de Blasio campaigned for an end to a double standard of justice in a two-tiered city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This crime - and that's what it appears to be - cannot go unpunished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watch that video and you see that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, clearly unarmed, clearly not threatening, is trying to explain to police that it's unfair that he's being targeted for arrest by cops even though this isn't a scene of chaotic lawlessness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner is upset. But not out of control. Saying that the local cops have a history of harassing him. That it has to stop. Starting today. That he had just broken up a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the cops are determined to arrest Garner. He pulls away from one cop who reaches for him. Garner does not swing at a single cop. He doesn't attack, shove or threaten any cop. He produces no weapon. He's agitated but sober. Is he resisting arrest?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, c'mon, a rookie crossing guard with some common-sense discretion could have defused this minor disturbance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But here comes big, brave, burly No. 99 from behind, administering an illegal and potentially lethal chokehold on obese and asthmatic Garner. The same kind of deadly chokehold that was used by another rogue cop named Francis Livoti in 1994 on a 29-year-old security guard named Anthony Baez, killing him because Baez accidentally hit the cop's car with a football during a game of catch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Livoti was eventually convicted in federal court of violating Baez's civil rights and sentenced to 71/2 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Garner video is Exhibit A in what could mean seven-to-15 years for No. 99.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After he and four other cops wrestled Garner to the ground, No. 99 grinds Garner's face into the sidewalk like someone mashing a puppy's face into poop on the carpet. All while Garner wheezes for air, pleading for life itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have written here many times of heroic cops and their selfless, ultimate sacrifices for our city. I mourned with 8 million others when Officer Pete Figoski gave his life bravely to a punk's bullet in the 75th Precinct two weeks before Christmas three years ago, leaving four shattered kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I gazed into the hole in the city's heart at Officer Dennis Guerra's funeral as his widow and children watched his coffin carried from the requiem Mass in Rockaway after he perished trying to save lives in a Coney Island fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I felt honored witnessing Commissioner Bill Bratton and cops of the 103rd Precinct commemorating the 26th anniversary of Officer Eddie Byrne's assassination by coward crack gangsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when bad cops disgrace the same badge those brave cops died honoring they dishonor them too. And the bad cops should be bum-rushed right off the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, as Bratton said after the Garner incident, a full investigation needs to be conducted. The cop who choked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and those who didn't stop him and instead piled on him deserve their day in criminal court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just as the so-called Mafia cops deserve their prison cells, and Justin Volpe who sodomized Abner Louima in a precinct bathroom belongs in his cage, the Garner video of No. 99 putting Garner in a chokehold is the kind of visual kindling that could ignite a harmonious, calm city into racial flames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's good that two of those cops have already been given desk jobs. And that the Internal Affairs Bureau and Staten Island DA Daniel Donovan are investigating Garner's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, No. 99 should be seated at a desk facing a poster of Francis Livoti in a prison jumpsuit so he can think what it might feel like to worry about who's coming from behind you in a prison yard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">ERIC GARNER</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> isn't alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,000 city residents have accused the NYPD of putting them in chokeholds in the past five years, the Civilian Complaint Review Board said Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The startling numbers were revealed as new CCRB Chairman Richard Emery said the panel plans to conduct a &quot;comprehensive study&quot; of chokehold complaints and find out why cops are apparently still using the forbidden practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chokehold study will be an &quot;agency priority,&quot; according to board executive director Tracy Catapano-Fox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of July 1, the CCRB had received 58 chokehold complaints against the NYPD this year, but it had only substantiated one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 1,022 chokehold allegations reported between 2009 and 2013, only 462 of the complaints were investigated. Of that number, just nine were substantiated, according to the CCRB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There wasn't enough evidence to prove a chokehold was used in 206 of the cases investigated, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CCRB will review all of the previous chokehold cases to determine what led to its use and whether anyone was harmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A DEFENSELESS dad, lying handcuffed and unresponsive on a sidewalk, received zero medical help from cops who instead just emptied his pockets, a shocking new video shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven-minute clip posted Saturday on YouTube shows an apparently lifeless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose head droops to the side as at least eight cops stand nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;C'mon guy,&quot; one cop says to Garner, the only thing on the video that suggests any of the officers was trying to help the Staten Island man. &quot;Breathe in, breathe out.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Garner, on his side with his eyes closed, doesn't move at all - even when the officer slaps him on the shoulder. The side of his head remains flat against the concrete, and his eyes never open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, another officer is seen taking a cell phone and a pack of cigarettes from the 43-year-old Garner's pants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after the arrival of an EMT four minutes into the video, no medical aid is provided to Garner. He's instead just loaded onto a stretcher and wheeled off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops say he was pronounced dead a short time later after arriving at a Staten Island hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo, caught on another video putting Garner in a chokehold, is shown standing a few feet away and chatting amiably with a uniformed colleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Near the end of the clip, he gives a satiric wave to the person shooting the second video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran, was placed on modified duty Saturday as cops and the Staten Island district attorney investigated the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo was stripped of his gun and his shield and assigned to work desk duty. The police union immediately denounced the move as &quot;knee-jerk&quot; and &quot;completely unwarranted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But detectives arrived at his Staten Island home Saturday afternoon, leaving about 25 minutes later with one box and three bags taken from the residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Justin Damico, on the force four years, was also pulled off the street - but he was not forced to turn in his badge or his weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside Damico's home Saturday, an infuriated woman screamed at reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Get off my f------ property! F------ retards!&quot; she howled. &quot;One picture of me and I'll sue you!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources told the Daily News there were no signs of neck trauma, such as a crushed windpipe, on the heavyset victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no indication this is death by strangulation or asphyxia,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another source said the likely cause of death will be a heart attack, although other actions - including the illegal takedown of Garner - &quot;will probably go down as contributing factors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's medical examiner would not confirm the preliminary findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton was irate after getting a look at a video from the Thursday afternoon tragedy near the Staten Island ferry terminal, another source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation will determine in part whether the cops were justified in their decision to jump Garner - and one source indicated they were not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tactically, very little was done right,&quot; the source said. &quot;The first two cops (Pantaleo and Damico) didn't engage Garner . . . They appear to know him. Do something to put him at ease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sergeant caught standing nearby in the video could be nailed for &quot;failure to supervise,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's devastated wife, Esaw, collapsed in the arms of her family with a piercing wail Saturday at a Harlem rally organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh my God!&quot; she shouted before tumbling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The widow, along with Garner's mother, daughter, and sister, sobbed loudly as Sharpton demanded justice for the family and the late father of six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no justification at all on this chokehold,&quot; he said. &quot;And there is clearly no reason, when a man is saying 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe,' that you maintain this chokehold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor de Blasio spoke on the phone with Esaw Garner and the dead man's mother, Gwen Carr, a spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor de Blasio called Mr. Garner's wife and mother (Saturday) morning to offer his condolences,&quot; said de Blasio spokeswoman Marti Adams. &quot;He reassured the family that the city is doing everything possible to ensure a full and thorough investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A funeral for Garner was set for Wednesday at Bethel Baptist Church in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first video, obtained by the Daily News, captured Garner complaining that he couldn't breathe as Pantaleo applies the chokehold and other cops take him to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops were investigating whether Garner was illegally selling &quot;loosies&quot; - untaxed single cigarettes. He had three full packs of cigarettes and one opened pack of untaxed smokes when police approached him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a Staten Island rally attended by about 500 people Saturday afternoon, Garner's sister said the minor transgression hardly justified the police response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people that own stores sell illegal cigarettes,&quot; said Ellisha Flagg. &quot;They lose their license, not their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's rap sheet includes 31 arrests dating to his first at age 16, cops said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A DEFENSELESS dad, lying handcuffed and unresponsive on a sidewalk, received zero medical help from cops who instead just emptied his pockets, a shocking new video shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven-minute clip posted Saturday on YouTube shows an apparently lifeless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose head droops to the side as at least eight cops stand nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;C'mon guy,&quot; one cop says to Garner, the only thing on the video that suggests any of the officers was trying to help the Staten Island man. &quot;Breathe in, breathe out.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Garner, on his side with his eyes closed, doesn't move at all - even when the officer slaps him on the shoulder. The side of his head remains flat against the concrete, and his eyes never open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, another officer is seen taking a cell phone and a pack of cigarettes from 43-year-old Garner's pants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after the arrival of an EMT four minutes into the video, no medical aid is provided to Garner. He's instead just loaded onto a stretcher and wheeled off of Bay St.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops say he was pronounced dead a short time later after arriving at a Staten Island hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo, caught on another video putting Garner in a chokehold, is shown standing a few feet away chatting amiably with a uniformed colleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Near the end of the clip, he gives a satiric wave to the person shooting the second video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran, was placed on modified duty Saturday as cops and the Staten Island district attorney investigated the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo was stripped of his gun and his shield and assigned to work desk duty. The police union immediately denounced the move as &quot;completely unwarranted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Justin Damico, on the force four years, was also pulled off the street - but was not forced to turn in his badge or his weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside Damico's home Saturday, an infuriated woman screamed at reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Get off my f------ property! F------ retards!&quot; she howled. &quot;One picture of me and I'll sue you!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While autopsy results on Garner were incomplete, sources told the Daily News there were no signs of neck trauma on the heavyset victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One source said the likely cause of death will be a heart attack, although other factors - including the illegal takedown of Garner - &quot;will probably go down as contributing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton was irate after getting a look at the video from the Thursday afternoon tragedy near the Staten Island ferry terminal, another source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation will determine in part whether the cops were justified in their decision to jump Garner - and one source indicated they were not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tactically, very little was done right,&quot; the source said. &quot;The first two cops (Pantaleo and Damico) didn't engage Garner . . . They appear to know him. Do something to put him at ease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sergeant caught standing nearby in the video could be nailed for &quot;failure to supervise,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's devastated wife Esaw collapsed in the arms of her family with a piercing wail Saturday at a Harlem rally organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh my God!&quot; she shouted before tumbling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The widow, along with Garner's mother, daughter, and sister, sobbed loudly as Sharpton demanded justice for the family and the late father of six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no justification at all on this chokehold,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;And there is clearly no reason, when a man is saying 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe,' that you maintain this chokehold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor de Blasio spoke on the phone with Esaw Garner and the dead man's mother, Gwen Carr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor de Blasio called Mr. Garner's wife and mother (Saturday) morning to offer his condolences,&quot; said de Blasio spokeswoman Marti Adams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He reassured the family that the city is doing everything possible to ensure a full and thorough investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio also sent Marco Carrion, head of his community affairs unit, to the Harlem event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A funeral for Garner was set for Wednesday at the Bethel Baptist Church in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first video, obtained by the Daily News, captured Garner complaining that he couldn't breathe as Pantaleo applies the chokehold and other cops take him to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops were investigating whether Garner was illegally selling &quot;loosies&quot; - untaxed single cigarettes. He had three full packs of cigarettes and one opened pack of untaxed smokes when police approached him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a Staten Island rally attended by about 500 people Saturday afternoon, Garner's sister said the minor transgression hardly justified the police response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people that own stores sell illegal cigarettes,&quot; said Ellisha Flagg. &quot;They lose their license, not their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton agreed the alleged crime should not become the case's focus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The issue is that an unarmed man was subjected to a chokehold and the result is he is no longer with us,&quot; said Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's rap sheet includes 31 arrests dating to his first at age 16, cops said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrolmen's Benevolent Association head Patrick Lynch warned New Yorkers not to jump to conclusions despite the videos.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NEIGHBORHOOD near the Staten Island Ferry terminal gets a steady flow of NYPD traffic and arrests - many for quality-of-life offenses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Triangular-shaped Tompkinsville Park (inset) and its surrounding streets are the subject of &quot;numerous complaints&quot; from local businesses and residents, says Police Commissioner Bill Bratton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the NYPD reported 98 arrests for various offenses, 100 summonses issued mostly for quality-of-life violations and 646 calls to 911 &quot;within the immediate area of that very small park,&quot; Bratton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quality-of-life infractions include loitering, having an open container of alcohol and public urination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall in Staten Island's 120th Precinct, crime was down 3% this year through July 13, according to NYPD statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Galloway, 55, a retired sales manager, gave the NYPD a qualified thumbs-up in policing the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cops are doing a pretty good job in general,&quot; said the longtime Staten Island resident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Galloway felt the police were overly aggressive: &quot;They don't know how to back off. All they know how to do is use force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 43, died after being placed in a chokehold Thursday outside a beauty parlor near the park. Cops accused him of selling untaxed cigarettes, better known as &quot;loosies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think cops in general don't have enough training in dealing with sensitivity,&quot; said Rogelio Ramos, 54, of West Brighton. &quot;I don't know what can be done about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of a New York City man who was allegedly placed in a chokehold by a police officer last week has reignited discussions about an arrest tactic that has been outlawed in most police departments and linked to dozens of in-custody deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has unleashed torrents of criticism. On Saturday, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Garner's family led a march on a police precinct in Staten Island. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Generally, officers are not allowed to use chokeholds to subdue suspects in most major American police departments, law enforcement experts said. But while struggling with a suspect, especially one as large as Garner, an officer may look to end a confrontation quickly in a way that is least likely to result in injury to both cop and suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Struggles between police officers and resisting individuals are not choreographed events,&quot; said Wayne Fisher, a professor of police studies at Rutgers University in New Jersey. &quot;They occur spontaneously and it's quite possible that an officer's arm could wind up around somebody's throat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner was approached by officers who were investigating the sale of loose cigarettes around 3:30 p.m. Thursday. Videos of the incident show Garner, a 43-year-old Staten Island man with chronic asthma, pleading with officers to leave him alone before one applies what appears to be a chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner crumples to the ground, according to one video, and repeatedly says, &quot;I can't breathe,&quot; while another officer presses his head to the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York City's Citizen Complaint Review Board received 50 complaints about officers using chokeholds from January to June, records show. Only one complaint was substantiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD and Los Angeles Police Department outlawed chokeholds decades ago. Then-NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly issued a ban in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Los Angeles City Council did the same in 1982, not long after then-Police Chief Daryl F. Gates sparked a furor when he suggested black people were more susceptible to death via chokehold than those of other races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems to me that we may be finding that in some blacks when it is applied, the veins or the arteries do not open as fast as they do on normal people,&quot; Gates said at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chokeholds were also removed from many police training regimens across the country, according to Eugene O'Donnell, a former district attorney in Brooklyn and Queens who investigated NYPD use-of-force cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Donnell said the officers in the Garner case may not have applied what is technically deemed a chokehold, and they may not have known how to execute the maneuver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference held the day after Garner died, New York Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said the maneuver appeared &quot;to have been a chokehold,&quot; but said the incident required further investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Donnell also said the situation with Garner may not be as cut and dried as many suggest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner had a distinct height and weight advantage over the officers, and appeared to be resisting arrest, O'Donnell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this case the guy is 350 pounds ... in that case, on the video, the guy clearly won't allow himself to be handcuffed, and if you look at that particular video, the cops look awfully small compared to him,&quot; he said. &quot;So how do you get someone to allow themselves to be handcuffed quickly so he and you don't get hurt? I'm not sure any department has a great secret formula.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner had been arrested twice in recent months by officers from the 120th Precinct, which oversees the area where he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday the NYPD identified one of the officers in the Garner case as Daniel Pantaleo and said he had been placed on &quot;modified duty.&quot; The police union blasted the move as &quot;absolutely wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's death has infuriated residents and could rekindle the mistrust between officers and residents that has been exacerbated by the NYPD's stop-and-frisk tactics and spying on Muslim communities in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After you look at the video and the use of this chokehold, which is against departmental procedure, there is no justification, at all, on this chokehold,&quot; Sharpton said Saturday. &quot;And there is clearly no reason when a man is saying, 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe,' that you maintain this chokehold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public outcry and media attention aside, O'Donnell said the fact that the officers were making an arrest, even for such a minor crime, helps minimize the likelihood that criminal charges will be filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case is much more difficult for prosecutors because it's a legitimate arrest,&quot; he said. &quot;Even though we would think it's a stupid arrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CRISIS over an unarmed man who died on a Staten Island street after a city cop grabbed him in a prohibited chokehold forced Mayor de Blasio to delay his Italian vacation Friday.Officers Daniel Pantaleo, with eight years on the force, and Justin Damico, a four-year veteran cop, were both yanked off the street a day after the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's arrest - including his desperate pleas that he couldn't breathe - was captured on an exclusive Daily News video that de Blasio admitted left him &quot;with a heavy heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was very troubling,&quot; he said at a City Hall news conference. &quot;I watched it the same way a family member would watch it, and it was very sad to watch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours later, the mayor put a hold on his flight for a family vacation in his ancestral homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He thought it was important to be here ... and consult with community leaders,&quot; said a top aide. De Blasio and his family will instead leave Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton planned to host Garner's family at his National Action Network headquarters in Harlem on Saturday morning. Sharpton said the one-sided attack by five officers on the Garner was an outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the most inhumane, insensitive display of disregard for the citizens you're supposed to protect that I've seen in a long time,&quot; said Sharpton, calling for criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo has been accused of false arrest and violating police procedures in two lawsuits, court records show. In one, two African-American plaintiffs won $15,000 apiece after claiming they'd been falsely arrested on Staten Island in 2012 and forced to publicly strip so cops could search them. The other lawsuit, filed in Brooklyn in February, alleged Pantaleo trumped up charges to arrest the plaintiff, who was jailed for 24 hours.The Staten Island district attorney and the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau were investigating Thursday's death. Cops accused Garner of selling &quot;loosies&quot; - single cigarettes from packs without tax stamps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 43-year-old father, whose rap sheet listed 31 arrests beginning when he was 16, was carrying three full packs of cigarettes and one open pack of untaxed cigarettes when cops moved in, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The loss of a life is always a tragedy,&quot; said Bratton. &quot;Nobody began the day with the expectation it would end the way it did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Garner autopsy results were not in Friday &quot;pending further study,&quot; the city medical examiner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A video shot by a bystander captured Garner's desperate cries as one cop shoved his head into the sidewalk and three others pinned him down - while a fifth cop put him in handcuffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't breathe!&quot; he shouted in vain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of a 43-year-old man's fatal encounter with police officers, caught on video by a bystander, Staten Island District Attorney Dan Donovan promises &quot;a complete and thorough investigation.&quot; Mayor de Blasio, calling the footage &quot;very troubling,&quot; nevertheless cautioned that &quot;we can't pass ultimate judgment based on one video.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are responsible early reactions by city leaders to a disturbing case that, at first blush, raises serious questions about the use of force. But first blush is not how police discipline is meted out, much less how criminal cases are made. The evidence - from all sides - must carry the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops approached </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thursday afternoon on the suspicion he was selling loose cigarettes on the street. One officer stood a few feet away in front of the large man, who weighed around 400 pounds; one stood to Garner's side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An argument ensued - with the officer who had engaged Garner in conversation apparently attempting to take him into custody and Garner repeatedly refusing to be arrested. He had been breaking up a fight before they arrived, he said, and was wrongly accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't sell anything,&quot; Garner said repeatedly, with frustration in his voice. &quot;I've been sitting here the whole time minding my own business. . . . Just leave me alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continued: &quot;Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a key point, the video cuts out. When the images return, Garner is facing the second officer. Garner then turns his back to that officer, who places him in what appears to be a choke hold. The two officers, and others who have joined the scene, bring him to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside a scrum of officers, his head pressed against the pavement by an officer when visible, Garner can be heard to say, six times, &quot;I can't breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chokeholds, said Police Commissioner Bill Bratton yesterday, &quot;are in fact prohibited by the NYPD.&quot; And though he could not yet definitively label what the officer did, he did say that &quot;this would appear to have been a chokehold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, an asthmatic, went into cardiac arrest and died at Richmond University Medical Center. The medical examiner has yet to rule on the cause of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only have the DA and NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau commenced an investigation but the Civilian Complaint Review Board and new NYPD inspector general will also be probing the incident. If together they cannot produce the &quot;full, thorough, transparent investigation&quot; that Bratton promises, then such an investigation is impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some are already placing this death in a prepackaged racial narrative, we hope and expect the city has grown and will not so easily succumb to cheap attempts to divide. The moment demands a sober, deliberate inquiry guided not by presuppositions, but facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She watched the shocking footage of her husband being subdued by Staten Island cops for the first time on Friday - unable to stomach it the night before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esaw Garner watched the video through eyes reddened by tears. It wasn't any better for the widow in the morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I couldn't watch the video of my husband being taken down last night,&quot; she said. &quot;I was too upset. I never slept. I watched it this morning and I got even more upset.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was clear to her what happened to her husband, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, outside a beauty shop in Tompkinsville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They killed him,&quot; she said. &quot;They choked him and took him down and I could hear him screaming that he couldn't breathe. It was so hard to watch. He was a nonviolent gentle giant and they killed him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinky, as the widow is affectionately known, sat in a relative's living room, wearing pink sneakers and a pink top. She stared out at the Manhattan skyline on what would have otherwise been a perfect summer day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has two grandkids who love him to death,&quot; she says of her husband. &quot;Every time he walks into the room they scream 'Pop-Pop and Ganpa.' He was great to me and his six kids. And a wonderful grandfather.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said her husband was 6-foot-5 and weighed over 300 pounds and loved to eat. He could be as loud as she was when they argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But his bark was always bigger than his bite,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday morning, Eric gave Pinky $400 and told her to get groceries for the house and then went to his corner of Bay St. and Victory Blvd. where he made his living selling bootleg cigarettes, $7 a pack and 75 cents for loosies. On the street he was known simply as &quot;E.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At home Pinky called him Bear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They met on one of those late-night area code 900 party lines that were popular in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Out of all the guys on the call I liked what he was saying most,&quot; she says, smiling at the memory. &quot;I gave him my private number and asked him to call me. We met the day before he left for school at Ohio Diesel Tech in September 1988. We had a great time together and he said he'd see me after not too long. But I thought I would never see him again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a few days before Christmas that year Pinky's doorbell rang in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I ran downstairs and there he was,&quot; she says. &quot;I told him I was pregnant by another man who was no longer in my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he'd happily raise the child, he won Pinky's heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I fell in love with him right then,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together they had five more kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their oldest boy, Eric Jr., 18, just graduated from Curtis High and got a basketball scholarship to Essex County College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a wonderful marriage,&quot; she says. &quot;Sure we had our problems. We separated once. But we never stopped loving each other and got back together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had his flaws. Some of them were endearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Was he perfect? No. He ate too many peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and Oreos at night,&quot; she says. &quot;He snored like a bear, but I couldn't sleep unless I could hear him snoring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinky said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been arrested several times, once for marijuana and a few times for selling bootleg cigarettes. Which rates right up there in the crime meter with old ladies selling knockoff DVDs and kids selling lemonade without a license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illegal, but small potatoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday afternoon, Pinky and Eric exchanged texts: At 1:45 p.m. she texted: &quot;You good out there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric replied, &quot;Yeah, I'm good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 2:47 p.m. she texted &quot;You ok?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He replied, &quot;I'm good. What's for dinner?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pork chops, Fat Boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll be home early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not long after that, a fight broke out between other neighborhood guys on Bay St.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bear broke up that fight,&quot; says Pinky. &quot;Not only was he nonviolent, one of the last things he did in his life was stop violence. But then a group of cops arrived. My guess is someone called 911 about the fight. No way did six or eight cops arrive to bust my husband for selling cigarettes. When they arrived the fight was over. The guys involved walked right past the cops. But they recognized my husband and tried to arrest him when he was the peacemaker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 3:15 p.m. Pinky said she was watching &quot;The People's Court&quot; when her son Eric Jr. asked for $20 to go to W. Fourth St. in Greenwich Village to play hoops. Then he said he received a text saying his father was being hassled by cops on Bay St. Pinky figured he was being arrested again. She started getting dressed when she received a flurry of calls and texts saying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been arrested by a group of cops and stopped breathing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She rushed to the hospital in a cab at 4:10 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I couldn't get answers. I remembered that in the morning before he left I told him I loved him and he said, 'Right back at ya.' Then he kissed me ... Little did I know it would be the last kiss he'd ever give me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hospital Pinky waited from 4:50 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. for answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally the doctors came out and said they did everything they could to save him,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By nightfall all her children gathered around their mother to weep for the death of their father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing I'll miss most is his snoring,&quot; she says, laughing through tears. &quot;I don't know how I'll ever be able to sleep again without hearing Bear snoring beside me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CRISIS over an unarmed man who died on a Staten Island street after a city cop grabbed him in a prohibited chokehold forced Mayor de Blasio to delay his Italian vacation Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers Daniel Pantaleo, with eight years on the force, and Justin Damico, a four-year veteran cop, were both put on desk duty a day after the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's arrest and desperate pleas that he couldn't breathe were captured on an exclusive Daily News video that de Blasio admitted left him &quot;with a heavy heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was very troubling,&quot; he said at a City Hall news conference. &quot;I watched it the same way a family member would watch it, and it was very sad to watch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours later, the mayor put a hold on his vacation getaway . &quot;He thought it was important to be here ... and consult with community leaders,&quot; said a top aide. He and his family will instead leave Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton planned to host Garner's family at his National Action Network headquarters in Harlem on Saturday morning. Sharpton said the one-sided attack by five officers on Garner was an outrage. &quot;It's the most inhumane, insensitive display of disregard for the citizens you're supposed to protect that I've seen in a long time,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo has been accused of false arrest and violating police procedures in two lawsuits, court records show. In one, two African-American plaintiffs won $15,000 apiece after claiming they'd been falsely arrested on Staten Island in 2012 and forced to publicly strip so cops could search them. All charges against them were dropped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff Darren Collins, 46, told The News on Friday night he was too frightened to talk .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm scared of what (the cops) may do to me ... I was harassed&quot; after the arrest,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other lawsuit, filed in Brooklyn in February, alleged Pantaleo trumped up charges to arrest the plaintiff, who was wrongly jailed for a day.The Staten Island district attorney and the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau were investigating Thursday's death. Cops accused Garner of selling &quot;loosies&quot; - single cigarettes from packs without tax stamps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 43-year-old dad, whose rap sheet lists 31 arrests beginning when he was 16, had three full packs of cigarettes and one open pack of untaxed smokes when cops moved in, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The loss of a life is always a tragedy,&quot; said Bratton. &quot;Nobody began the day with the expectation it would end the way it did.&quot;A video shot by a bystander captured Garner's desperate cries as one cop shoved his head into the sidewalk and three others pinned him down - while a fifth cuffed him. &quot;I can't breathe!&quot; he shouted in vain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Police Department is investigating the death of a Staten Island man during a scuffle with police officers in which he appeared to be held in a chokehold. The incident has ignited outrage in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, had just broken up a fight in the borough's Tompkinsville neighborhood when he was approached by several police officers, said two witnesses in telephone interviews with The Times. Police said the officers approached Garner on Thursday afternoon to question him about the possible sale of illegal cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner became involved in an escalating argument with the officers, repeatedly asking them to &quot;leave me alone&quot; before the officers pounced on him, videos of the incident show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One officer appeared to place Garner, who friends say had chronic asthma, in a chokehold from behind. The officer did not release the hold even after Garner fell to the ground, according to the video. Moments later, Garner can be heard saying, &quot;I can't breathe&quot; while an officer presses his head against the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As soon as backup came, that's when the guy ran behind him and started choking him,&quot; said Ramsey Orta, 22, a Staten Island resident who recorded one of the videos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the incident a tragedy during a news conference Friday with Police Commissioner William J. Bratton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like so many New Yorkers, I was very troubled by the video I reviewed earlier today,&quot; said De Blasio, who postponed a vacation to Italy on Friday afternoon to tend to city business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton said officers approached Garner about 3:30 p.m. &quot;concerning the sale of untaxed cigarettes.&quot; He was pronounced dead about one hour later at Richmond University Medical Center. A cause of death has yet to be determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The video made it quite apparent that the officers made it known to the deceased that they were intending to arrest him,&quot; Bratton said during the news conference. &quot;He made it quite known to them that he was not going to allow that arrest to occur.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton said that the officer may have used a chokehold, which would have been a violation of department policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, as defined in the department's patrol guide, this would appear to have been a chokehold,&quot; Bratton said. &quot;But the investigation, both by the district attorney's office as well as by our Internal Affairs, will seek to make that final determination as part of our investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the episode highlighted exactly why chokeholds are illegal and suggested the officers may have overreacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's painful and horrifying to watch the video knowing throughout what the end is,&quot; she said. &quot;Chokeholds are illegal, they're against the Police Department regulations in New York ... and it's horrifying to think that it's over accusations of selling illegal cigarettes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orta and 27-year-old Gary Nieves Jr., another Staten Island resident who said he witnessed the altercation, said that police officers routinely accused Garner of selling loose cigarettes. Nieves said officers did not try to revive Garner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't see any resuscitation efforts,&quot; he said. &quot;They basically took a look at him, walked back to their truck parked a half a block away, and walked his dead body up to the ambulance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DeBlasio promised a thorough inquiry into the Garner's death. The investigation will be led by Richmond County Dist. Atty. Daniel Donovan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a responsibility to keep every New Yorker safe, and that includes when individuals are in custody of the NYPD. That is a responsibility that Police Commissioner Bratton and I take very seriously,&quot; the mayor said in a statement. &quot;We are harnessing all resources available to the city to ensure a full and thorough investigation of the circumstances of this tragic incident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several officers appear on the video during the incident. Two have been reassigned to desk duty; one is an eight-year veteran of the department, the other has been with the NYPD for four years, said Bratton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner had been arrested three times in the last year, according to New York City court records. He was arrested on March 28 and May 7 by officers from the 120th Precinct, which patrols the area where he was killed. He was also arrested in August 2013 and charged with possession of marijuana and the sale of untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was charged again with selling cigarettes illegally in March and May. He was due in court on the charges in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton and the National Action Network will join Garner's family at events in Harlem and on Staten Island on Saturday. Nieves said residents along the street where Garner died were still shaken Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are outraged. They want answers,&quot; Nieves said. &quot;They want to not feel like victims.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't breathe! I can't breathe!&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, repeatedly screamed after at least five NYPD officers took him down in front of a Tompkinsville beauty supply store when he resisted being handcuffed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within moments Garner, a married father of six children with two grandchildren, ceased struggling and appeared to become unconscious as police called paramedics to the scene. An angry crowd gathered, some recording with smartphones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I kissed my husband this morning, I never thought it would be for the last time,&quot; Garner's wife, Esaw, told the Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a history of arrests for selling untaxed cigarettes. They did not immediately say why officers were at the scene when he drew their attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NYPD spokesman would only say the man &quot;was being placed in custody, went into cardiac arrest and died&quot; at Richmond University Medical Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esaw Garner said that when she arrived at the hospital her husband was already dead. She said she pleaded with police to tell her what happened, but they brushed her off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They wouldn't tell me anything,&quot; she said. &quot;The Internal Affairs office called me to say they were taking over the case because there was wrongdoing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials confirmed that NYPD Internal Affairs officers launched an investigation Thursday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esaw Garner said her husband was unable to work because he suffered from a host of ailments, including chronic asthma, diabetes and sleep apnea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was out there hanging out. He sold cigarettes, but he was a good man,&quot; the widow said. &quot;He never hurt a soul. He was the sweetest, kindest person in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, 65, added, &quot;I want justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was not armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Staten Island resident was sitting in front of Bay Beauty on Bay St. and Victory Blvd. just before 5 p.m. when two plainclothes cops began questioning him about selling untaxed cigarettes, a video obtained by the Daily News shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't do s---!&quot; the 6-foot-4 Garner, wearing a sweaty T-shirt and khaki shorts, told the officers from the 121st Precinct when they approached him. &quot;I was just minding my own business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today!&quot; he yelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramsey Orta, 22, who shot the video, tried to intervene, telling the officers his friend had just broken up a fight between three men and had not been selling cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when backup uniformed officers arrived, the cops moved in to cuff Garner, the video shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't touch me, please,&quot; said Garner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Garner refused orders to put his hands behind his back, one of the plainclothes cops, wearing a green Oakland A's T-shirt with No. 99 on the back, got behind him and put him in a chokehold, the footage shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A struggle ensued as three uniformed officers joined in on the arrest, knocking the man to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He screamed, &quot;I can't breathe!&quot; six times before he went silent and paramedics were called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They jumped him and they were choking him. He was foaming at the mouth,&quot; Orta told The News. &quot;And that's it, he was done. The cops were saying, 'No, he's OK, he's OK.&quot; He wasn't OK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some witnesses said officers used a stun gun on Garner, but the video did not show that and a police spokesman said he was unaware such a weapon was used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were choking him. He kept saying, 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe! Get off of me, get off of me!' and I didn't hear any more talking after that,&quot; said witness Valencia Griffin, 50, of Staten Island. &quot;He died right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also said Garner had just broken up a fight before cops began questioning him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was trying to stop a fight,&quot; Griffin said. &quot;They didn't have to choke him like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness, who would only give his first name, Douglas, said he's known Garner for four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a very big man, very intimidating, but he's just a big teddy bear,&quot; said Douglas, 50. &quot;He's the nicest guy. I can't believe what I saw. That's no way to do an arrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Thomas, 49, of Brooklyn said he was arrested Saturday in the same neighborhood and beaten with a baton - for playing chess in a nearby park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cops pulled up. They said we weren't allowed to play chess,&quot; Thomas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another cellphone video obtained by The News shows a group of uniformed cops on top of Thomas, struggling to handcuff him - one beating him in the legs with a baton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not immediately clear why Thomas was arrested, but he said he was released soon after being taken to the 121st Precinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video does not show what preceded the arrest. But it does show an angry mob crowding around and cursing at cops, who ordered people to stand back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They beat me with a baton. I just laid there while they beat me,&quot; said Thomas, still sporting welts on his legs. &quot;What could I do?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She got no details from police until after she had gone to the hospital to identify his body, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw him with his eyes wide open and I said, 'Babe, don't leave me. I need you.' But he was already gone,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A family friend searching for her in the hospital ran into detectives from the NYPD's Internal Affairs Division. The friend put them on the phone with her, the grieving widow said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She spoke with a Detective Howard, who told her, &quot;I'm sorry for your loss,&quot; she said. He said his office was involved &quot;because there is wrongdoing,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials said Garner had a history of arrests for selling untaxed cigarettes. Cops said they observed him selling his wares Thursday on Bay St. and moved in for an arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NYPD spokesman would only say the man &quot;was being placed in custody, went into cardiac arrest and died&quot; at Richmond University Medical Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Esaw Garner and other family members said it was a trumped up claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're covering their asses, he was breaking up a fight. They harassed and harassed my husband until they killed him,&quot; she said. Garner's family said he didn't have any cigarettes on him or in his car at the time of his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she pleaded with police at the hospital to tell her what happened, but they brushed her off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They wouldn't tell me anything,&quot; she said.Officials confirmed that NYPD Internal Affairs officers launched an investigation Thursday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Records show Garner was due in court in October on three Staten Island cases, including charges of pot possession and possession or selling untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esaw Garner said her husband was unable to work because he suffered from a host of ailments, including chronic asthma, diabetes and sleep apnea.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This had nothing to do with the fight, this had something to do with something else,&quot; the cop said, and walked away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A law enforcement source said the incident was troubling.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2012 airport bomber ID'd by prosecutors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years after a bomb in a tour bus at the Burgas airport killed seven people, including five Israeli tourists, Bulgarian prosecutors have identified the bomber as a dual French-Lebanese citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bomber, who was killed in the blast along with the Bulgarian bus driver, was 25-year-old Mohamad Hassan El-Husseini. Prosecutors said he carried out the attack using a fake driver's licence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The July 18, 2012, attack, which took place after an Israeli group had boarded a bus following a charter flight, also wounded 35 people. The government initially blamed Hezbollah, but later eased off that claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year prosecutors said the attack organizers included two other men of Lebanese origin, Meliad Farah, an Australian citizen, and Hassan el-Hajj Hassan, a Canadian citizen. Neither has been arrested.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nuke talks extended as deadline missed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iran and six world powers failed Saturday to meet their target date for cutting a nuclear deal but agreed to extend the talks until Nov. 24 in a bid to overcome stubborn differences over the size and capacity of activities by Tehran that could be used to make nuclear arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Months of exhausting negotiations were meant to culminate in an agreement by Sunday that would limit programs Iran says it needs to produce energy and for other peaceful purposes - but can also be used to make nuclear arms. In return, Tehran would have gotten progressive relief from all nuclear-related sanctions on its economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have made tangible process on some of the issues,&quot; said EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, who co-ordinated the talks in Vienna on behalf of the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. But she cautioned of &quot;significant gaps on some core issues which will require more time and effort.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Police Department has launched an internal investigation into the death of a 43-year-old man whose final moments were captured in a video in which he can be heard gasping &quot;I can't breathe&quot; over and over again after an officer is seen placing him in a chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> died Thursday afternoon as plain clothes officers tried to take him into custody on a Staten Island street for illegal cigarette sales. An amateur video, posted on the New York Daily News website, shows an argument of mounting intensity as Garner, who had been arrested on about 30 occasions, quarrels with a plain clothes officer about whether he would be arrested or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video, apparently recorded by a bystander, shows another plain clothes officer suddenly move in and place his arm around Garner's throat, pulling him back before bringing him to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner can be seen crawling forward as the officer hangs on. Soon a voice captured on the video can be heard saying, &quot;Something's wrong with him.&quot; Garner cannot be seen moving in the video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owner arrested over abandoned corpses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A co-owner of a Texas mortuary was arrested Friday, accused of abusing seven corpses found unattended and in advanced stages of decomposition inside her family's business earlier this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rachel Hardy-Johnson, 35, was arrested on seven warrants at her Arlington home. Police are still searching for her husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two are accused of treating in &quot;an offensive manner&quot; the remains of seven of the eight bodies found Tuesday inside the Johnson Family Mortuary. Records indicate five of the deceased had died in March, April and May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The building's landlord called police Tuesday morning to report he had found the bodies inside after previously ordering the mortuary owners to vacate the building for nonpayment of rent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frank McFarland found the blue crab in his pot when fishing off Nome. It's being kept alive at the Norton Sound Seafood Center until he can have it mounted. The rare crab has become a star of sorts, with people showing up to have their photos taken with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott Kent, with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, says he has no idea why the red king crab is blue but suspects it's just a mutation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kent says a blue crab &quot;turns up once in a blue moon.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUNCHEON, South Korea -- South Korea's most wanted man, whose heavily decomposed body was found in an orchard last month, had evaded arrest by hiding behind an upstairs wall of a wooden cabin, with suitcases of cash at hand, prosecutors said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body of Yoo Byung-eun, 73, wanted in connection with the sinking of a ferry in April, was only identified this week, more than a month after he was found lying next to a copy of a book he had written, empty bottles of alcohol nearby, ending the country's biggest and most dramatic manhunt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did all we could to find Yoo and are devastated we couldn't find him alive,&quot; Kim Hoe-jong, a senior prosecutor, said at a media briefing in Incheon, the city west of Seoul where the ferry began its last voyage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For two months, wanted posters offering a reward for Yoo's capture faded under the summer sun or disintegrated in the rain while thousands of police combed the country looking for a man who co-founded a church, held an exhibition of photographs at the Louvre in Paris and did jail time for fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 12, the same day farmer Park Yoon-seok found Yoo's body in his plum orchard, thousands of police and prosecutors were busy raiding Yoo's sprawling religious compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yoo headed the family that owned the company that operated the Sewol, a ferry that capsized April 16 on a journey to the holiday island of Jeju, killing about 300 people, most of them high school students, and triggering an outpouring of grief across the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola has killed 632 people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since an outbreak began in February. A statement from the president's office said Sheik Humarr Khan, 39, a virologist credited with treating more than 100 Ebola victims, has been transferred to a treatment ward.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco city leaders late Tuesday approved a measure for the November ballot that would place a 2-cent-an-ounce municipal tax on sodas and other sugary drinks, hoping to become the first major city to impose such a levy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other cities have tried and failed to tax sugary drinks. The plan, if passed by voters, would apply to any nonalcoholic, sweetened drink with more than 25 calories per 12 ounces.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Three women were arrested Wednesday on charges of conspiring to raise money for Somali insurgent group al-Shabab, the Justice Department said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women, two living in the United States and one living in the Netherlands, are believed to have directed a network made up primarily of women that funneled money to conduits in Kenya and Somalia, the department said in a statement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of runner-up Prabowo Subianto said an estimated 52,000 polling stations had reported irregularities, putting about 21 million votes in question out of 133 million votes cast. Widodo won by more than 8 million votes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE death of a father of six after he was put into a chokehold by a New York police officer has stoked racial tensions and drawn comparisons to the case of Rodney King, which sparked riots after he was beaten by officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, was grabbed by five officers after being stopped for selling untaxed cigarettes, a low-level offence, on Staten Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A shocking video of the incident, which has been watched more than 500,000 times on YouTube, shows him pleading &quot;I can't breathe&quot; as his head is pressed against the pavement. He died an hour later in hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two police officers and four paramedics have been put on restricted duties amid protests and calls from Mr Garner's family for Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who is allegedly responsible, to face justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the seven-minute video, Mr Garner is heard saying he has &quot;done nothing&quot; and berates the officers for trying to arrest him, telling them: &quot;I'm minding my business, please leave me alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pantaleo and four officers then grab him and they fall to the floor. Mr Pantaleo is on Mr Garner's back with his arms around his neck. The officers can be heard saying &quot;Something's wrong with him&quot; but make no attempt to revive him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the paramedics arrive they check for a pulse but appear to do little else before putting Mr Garner into an ambulance. The Staten Island district attorney has announced an investigation which could potentially lead to charges. The NYPD also said it would retrain all its 35,000 officers in how to subdue suspects, and more taser stun guns may be issued to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton has said Mr Pantaleo used a chokehold even though they are banned by the force and has ordered police Internal Affairs officers to investigate. There have been claims Mr Garner was resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His funeral was held yesterday at a Baptist church in Brooklyn. It followed a Harlem rally last weekend in which civil rights campaigner the Rev Al Sharpton spoke to a crowd which included his widow Esaw, who collapsed in tears. He said: &quot;Even if police procedures don't kick in, when does your sense of humanity kick in? Have we gotten so cold?&quot; New York commentator Denis Hamill said the video was &quot;disturbing proof of how far we have not come since Rodney King&quot;. King was beaten by Los Angeles police officers after a high-speed car chase in 1991. The beating was captured on film and the later acquittals of four officers triggered riots a year later in which 53 people died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's mayor Bill de Blasio has delayed a holiday in Italy to also start an investigation. He has pledged to restore relations between police and the black community, who claim &quot;stop and frisk&quot; tactics unfairly target them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;RIP </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; wrote Ian Bassin, a deputy counsel who earns $140,000 a year. &quot;You deserved so much more from our City. We will and we must do better.&quot; <BR>The premature July 19 posting on his personal Twitter page enraged cops, who are under fire over the death even before an official autopsy report. <BR>&quot;That is crazy. This administration is filled with a bunch of liberal loonies,&quot; said one police source. &quot;I don't understand how someone who represents the mayor could go public with a statement like that without the autopsy report.&quot; <BR>The tweet came just two days before Mayor de Blasio stressed the need to let the investigation take its course before rushing to judgement. &quot;All sides need to be heard and all evidence looked at,&quot; de Blasio said Monday while vacationing in Italy. <BR>Bassin declined to discuss the tweet when reached by phone Wednesday, and the mayor's office also refused comment. <BR>Garner, a 350-pound asthmatic diabetic, died struggling with police July 17 in Staten Island when they tried to arrest him for peddling &quot;loosie&quot; cigarettes. <BR>Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo placed Garner, 43, in an apparent chokehold before he and fellow cop Justin Damico dragged him to the ground. He went into cardiac arrest and died on the way to a hospital. <BR>An initial police report noted that two supervising sergeants failed to tell Internal Affairs investigators about the chokehold - but sources said they were unaware the move had been used because they got to the scene after Garner was already on the ground, said a high-ranking police source. <BR>Sergeants Kizzy Adonis and Dhanan Saminath were never informed by the officers about how they took down Garner, who was still breathing while lying unconscious on the ground at the time, the source said. <BR>Internal Affairs detectives are still trying to determine whether Pantaleo applied a forbidden chokehold or if it was a submission hold that may fall within departmental guidelines. <BR>Authorities are also still awaiting the final results of Garner's autopsy, which could take up to two weeks while the medical examiner performs toxicology tests. <BR>Meanwhile, NYPD Internal Affairs is investigating another apparent chokehold, which was caught on video in a Harlem subway station. <BR>Police saw Ronald Johns, 23, go through a service-entrance gate on Lexington Avenue and East 125th Street around 5 p.m. on July 14 - and struggled to arrest him when he refused to show ID, officials said.  A video shows an officer punch him in the face and use either a headlock or chokehold to get him under control. <BR>A community activist in East Harlem said the video was sent to him anonymously. It was also posted to Facebook. <BR> 2014 Legal Monitor Worldwide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This ends today,'' he said. Less than an hour later, he was dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was all caught on video and, now, his final words have become a rallying cry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the sweltering sanctuary of Bethel Baptist Church -- where Mr. Garner's mother and stepfather are members -- relatives, friends and supporters filled the pews up to the balcony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garner's family sat in the front rows, facing the white coffin that held his body. When one of his daughters rose to give a speech, she was overcome with emotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The only thing my daughter asked for her birthday is for her Pop-Pop to make the cake,'' she said from the pulpit. ''I just don't know how I'm going to explain to her that Pop-Pop is not going to make the cake.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who gathered at the church made it clear they viewed his death as tragic, avoidable and emblematic of systemic problems in the relationship between the police and some communities they serve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This here was absolutely murder,'' Estelle Queenie Smith, one of Mr. Garner's neighbors, said as she entered the church for a viewing before the funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton arrived at the funeral shortly after it began and announced both outside and in a fiery address from the pulpit that on Friday he, Mr. Garner's family and their lawyers would meet with representatives from the United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York to ask for a federal civil rights investigation into his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Yes, God will make a way,'' he said, ''but God expects something of us. When you can in broad daylight choke one of God's children, he expects us to stand up and demand justice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sharpton drew several standing ovations, including when he asked Ramsey Orta, the man who took the video of last Thursday's confrontation, to join him at the pulpit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sensing the volatility of the situation, both the police and City Hall have moved quickly to respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose campaign was built around his pledge to end the police tactic known as stop and frisk, delayed a vacation by a day and said there would be a thorough investigation. On Tuesday, Police Commissioner William J. Bratton announced that he was ordering a sweeping review of the department's training and tactics. Letitia James, the city's public advocate, was among the city officials at the funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the video of the arrest, Officer Daniel Pantaleo was shown wrapping his arm around the neck of Mr. Garner, who was on a Staten Island street corner, arguing with the police and objecting to being arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department has banned the use of chokeholds since 1993. In 1994, a Bronx man was killed by an officer using the grip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the ban, complaints of officers' using chokeholds have steadily come before the Civilian Complaint Review Board. From 2009 to 2013, the board received 1,022 such complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police said Wednesday that Internal Affairs detectives were investigating an arrest on July 14, captured on cellphone video, in which an officer appears to use a chokehold to restrain a 22-year-old man seen skipping the fare in the 125th Street and Lexington Avenue subway station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Thursday, after Officer Pantaleo grabbed hold of Mr. Garner, the two men tumbled to the ground as several other officers swarmed on top of them. Mr. Garner was heard on the video saying that he could not breathe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two emergency medical technicians and the two paramedics who responded to Mr. Garner, and appeared to be moving without urgency, have been suspended without pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ellisha Flagg, Mr. Garner's sister, said at a vigil at Tompkinsville Park on Tuesday that the apparent chokehold quite likely exacerbated the effects of her brother's asthma, a condition he had had since childhood. Autopsy results are still pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In remembrances, friends and neighbors recalled Mr. Garner as a gentle man who may have scrambled to make a few extra dollars but who would never have hurt anyone. He married his college sweetheart, Esaw, with whom he has five children, and worked security in nightclubs to provide for them. But he struggled to stay employed because of respiratory problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He was a big giant, but a real teddy bear,'' Ms. Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before and just after Mr. Sharpton's appearance, a crowd of around 100 demonstrators on the sidewalks protested. A woman cried out, ''One day it's going to be your murder!'' A man shouting ''They killed him'' was escorted off the block by men in orange shirts that said, ''I Am Present for Peace.'' Part of the crowd chanted, ''No more.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Stop killing us,'' a woman said to the face of a police captain. ''And tell your friends to stop killing us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''O.K.,'' he replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the funeral, Mr. Garner's widow hobbled slowly from the church, her arm held by a son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes earlier, 10 burly pallbearers carried Mr. Garner's coffin through a drizzle and into a black hearse. Nearby, family members hugged and wept. A voice from the crowd called out, ''I can't breathe!''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mayor Bill de Blasio watched a video of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> slipping into unconsciousness as the police subdued him last Thursday, he issued an order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor's top aides were to plunge into what was fast developing into one of the most significant crises of his young administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unarmed black man had died on Staten Island after an officer put him in what appeared to be a chokehold, a move banned by the police manual. Anger was mounting, as video of the confrontation spread online. How the de Blasio administration responded would be a major test, of a sort that for decades has been an unwelcome rite of passage for New York City leaders, including the deaths of Amadou Diallo during Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration, and of Sean Bell under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The mayor said, 'We should put our bodies on the situation,' '' said Emma Wolfe, director of intergovernmental affairs and a longtime confidante of his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The de Blasio administration's assertive outreach so far appears to have helped contain the initial fallout from Mr. Garner's death. There have been protests, and even calls for Police Commissioner William J. Bratton to resign. And there is still anger, particularly on the northern tip of Staten Island, where Mr. Garner lived and died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But so far there has been no widespread criticism of Mr. de Blasio, who delayed by one day his departure for a vacation in Italy to discuss the episode with city officials and community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr. Garner's death, both Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Bratton called the Rev. Al Sharpton, a longtime critic of the police who remains capable of rallying people across the city. They promised him a swift investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those conversations ''set the tone immediately,'' said Rachel Noerdlinger, the first lady Chirlane McCray's chief of staff, who has been a central player in City Hall's response to the death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Ms. Noerdlinger was appointed, her primary job was publicized as strategizing for Ms. McCray, but she has been a key adviser in overall issues affecting the administration. For many years before entering government, she was Mr. Sharpton's closest aide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And within City Hall, she has quickly taken on an unofficial portfolio: crisis management in matters of racial tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She helped coordinate the administration's response, for example, to the fatal stabbing last month of a 6-year-old boy in an elevator of a Brooklyn housing project, where the Housing Authority had failed to install security cameras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some mayoral aides played down Ms. Noerdlinger's role in responding to Mr. Garner's death, others said she had been instrumental.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She spoke to Mr. Garner's family twice on Friday. She arranged the mayor's call to Mr. Garner's family on Saturday. And on Sunday she was seated at Riverside Church as Mr. Sharpton delivered a sermon on the encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, Ms. Noerdlinger said that the mayor and his aides had assured both Mr. Sharpton and Mr. Garner's family that the city's investigation would be ''expeditious.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer who appeared to put Mr. Garner in the chokehold has been placed on modified duty, and four emergency medical responders who appeared on another video seemingly treating Mr. Garner without urgency have been suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Noerdlinger has had help from other City Hall officials. A team led by Marco A. Carrion, commissioner of the mayor's community affairs unit, attended days' worth of protests on Staten Island, and attended a memorial to Mr. Garner on Friday to speak with residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday night, Ms. Noerdlinger and Mr. Carrion represented the mayor at Mr. Garner's funeral, sitting in a front pew, feet away from the coffin. But Mr. de Blasio also had circumstances working in his favor: The video of the confrontation made it far less risky for the mayor and his aides to question the actions of the police. He and Mr. Bratton both quickly said that Mr. Garner appeared to have been put in a chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This looks like the kind of case that could have produced great anger; keeping the calm, keeping the peace is a high priority,'' said Kenneth Sherrill, an emeritus professor of political science at Hunter College. ''Having the prescience to say 'I share the outrage' is a very rational approach. It may be what's in their hearts as well.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. de Blasio also benefits from his criticism of the Police Department's stop-and-frisk practices, a stance that helped set him apart in the mayoral race last year and won him support in many black and Latino neighborhoods where the stops were most common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm excited that our leadership recognizes that there are issues in the N.Y.P.D.,'' said the Rev. Demetrius S. Carolina, pastor of First Central Baptist Church on Staten Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Carolina was among the civic leaders Mr. de Blasio called on Friday, and said he had been kept abreast of the unfolding investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilwoman Deborah L. Rose of Staten Island, who is the first black council member from that borough, said she was satisfied with City Hall's performance so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The response has been expedient, it's been thorough,'' she said. ''They have not left my community. I've had total access, and I do feel at this point that it has been transparent.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You'd think a former attorney for the Obama White House now serving as deputy counsel to the mayor of New York would know enough to wait until results are in to make any judgment about a sensitive death at the hands of police. Especially when his boss is promising a &quot;full and thorough investigation.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Ian Bassin must've missed that class in law school. Less than two days after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> died during an arrest, Bassin tweeted out the following: &quot;RIP </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. You deserved so much more from our City. We will and we must do better.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   In a video of the incident, it appears one of the cops used an illegal chokehold to subdue Garner, though even that's not yet clear. Even so, the officer in question and several emergency responders have been suspended, and Commissioner Bill Bratton has promised retraining for the entire police force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Bassin's tweet raises a troubling new question about how the administration is itself responding.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his campaign for mayor, Bill de Blasio asserted that New Yorkers don't trust the cops. But what about the folks in the mayor's office? Can cops - and the public - trust them? Or is this going to be one of those times where we hurry the investigation so we can get right to the hanging? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police have a responsibility to the people. And in this space yesterday, we made clear that if the cops arresting Garner are found to have behaved wrongly, we'll support strong disciplinary action. But the city has a responsibility too. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   And when a deputy counsel to the mayor sends the message he's already pre-judged the case, he's as divisive as any errant cop. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Oh my God! They took him. They took my baby!&quot; said Garner's wife, Esaw, as she walked up the to casket. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The grieving widow arrived at the church at about 5 p.m., flanked by two of the couple's six children, both dressed in matching suits and supporting their distraught mother. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner's mother and sister arrived a short time later in a stretch limousine, also looking devastated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;My father meant everything to me,&quot; his daughter said from the pulpit, noting that he will be absent at his granddaughter's birthday next week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hundreds of mourners made their way past Garner as he lay in an open, white casket, dressed in a white suit and a light-blue shirt and tie. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He was a good person. He was no thug,&quot; said Nicholas Heyward, 57, who grew up with Garner when the two lived in the Gowanus Houses in Boerum Hill. &quot;He didn't &shy;deserve this. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;When I realized it was him, I felt a lot of pain. I was angry, upset and disappointed with the actions of the police.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A top de Blasio administration lawyer infuriated cops by tweeting about how the city failed NYPD &quot;chokehold&quot; victim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - even as the investigation into his death remains open.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;RIP </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; wrote Ian Bassin, a deputy counsel who earns $140,000 a year. &quot;You deserved so much more from our City. We will and we must do better.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The premature July 19 posting (above) on Bassin's personal Twitter page enraged cops, who are under fire over the death even before an official autopsy report. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;That is crazy. This administration is filled with a bunch of liberal loonies,&quot; said a police source. &quot;I don't understand how someone who represents the mayor could go public with a statement like that without the autopsy report.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tweet came just two days before Mayor de Blasio stressed the need to let the investigation take its course before rushing to judgment. &quot;All sides need to be heard and all evidence looked at,&quot; he said Monday in Italy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday, City Hall responded to questions about the tweet by saying, &quot;The mayor and police commissioner have made the administration's position on this tragic incident clear.&quot; Bassin declined to discuss the tweet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner, a 350-pound asthmatic diabetic, died struggling with police on July 17 on Staten Island when they tried to arrest him for peddling &quot;loosie&quot; cigarettes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He had more than 30 prior arrests, including for assault, and argued with cops during the cigarette incident, repeatedly resisting their efforts to cuff him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officer Daniel Pantaleo placed Garner, 43, in an apparent chokehold before he and fellow cop Justin Damico dragged him to the ground. Garner went into cardiac arrest and died on the way to a hospital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An initial police report noted that two supervising sergeants failed to tell Internal Affairs about the chokehold, but sources said the sergeants were unaware of the chokehold because they got to the scene after Garner was already on the ground, said a high-ranking police source. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sgts. Kizzy Adonis and Dhanan Saminath were never informed by the officers about how they took down Garner, who was still breathing but unconscious, the source said. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton paid tribute to the auto mechanic and invited the man who shot the video, Ramsey Ortiz, to stand next to him at the pulpit where he thanked Ortiz for &quot;standing up for justice and not turning around while something wrong was happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton told the crowd of at least 500 people inside Bethel Baptist Church in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn that Ortiz &quot;stood up for justice and showed respect for humanity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner died after an NYPD officer appeared to have placed him in an unauthorized chokehold Thursday to restrain him during his arrest on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes on a sidewalk near the Staten Island Ferry terminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amateur video shows Officer Daniel Pantaleo restraining Garner while half a dozen other officers pushed the 350-pound man to the ground to handcuff him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo was stripped of his badge and gun and has been assigned to desk duty. The Staten Island district attorney is investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, emergency medical technicians who responded to the scene from Richmond University Hospital were suspended after claims were made that they did not aid Garner fast enough when they arrived at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the video, Garner pleads with police to let him go. Garner is heard saying to police &quot;I can't breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video also shows another officer pressing Garner's face into the sidewalk. Family members say that Garner was asthmatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At last night's service, Garner's wife, Esaw, weeped and let out a painful cry as ushers closed her husband's coffin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh my God,&quot; she yelled out just before many in the packed church started singing &quot;Amazing Grace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several eulogies delivered by clergy, including Sharpton, as well as elected officials, followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton promised those in the church that there will be a full investigation and the police officers would be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be no backroom playing,&quot; he said, his voice rising and his hands reaching out toward the audience as they stood up. &quot;We cannot live in a city that can choke us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of a father of six after he was put into a chokehold by a New York police officer has stoked racial tensions and drawn comparisons to the case of Rodney King, which sparked riots after he&nbsp; was beaten by officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, was seized by five officers after he was stopped on the street for selling untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A video of the incident, which has gone viral, shows Mr Garner pleading &quot;I can't breathe&quot; as his head is pressed against the pavement with his eyes closed. He died an hour later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two police officers and four paramedics have since been suspended following protests over the weekend and calls for the officer responsible, Daniel Pantaleo, to face punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven minute footage of Mr Garner's death, which took place near Tompkinsville Park on Staten Island, has been watched more than 500,000 times on YouTube.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Garner is heard to say he has &quot;done nothing&quot; and argues with police for trying to arrest him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes after the dispute four officer pounce upon him and they tussle to the floor, with Mr Mr Pantaleo on Mr Garner's back with his arms around his neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers can be heard saying &quot;Something's wrong with him&quot; but make no attempt to revive him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the paramedics arrive they check for a pulse but do little else before loading Mr Garner onto a stretcher and putting him in an ambulance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton has said Mr Pantaleo used a chokehold even though they are banned by the force and has ordered police Internal Affairs&nbsp; officers to investigate. There have been claims Mr Garner was resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His funeral was held yesterday in an emotional service at a Baptist church in Brooklyn, after a Harlem rally last weekend in which civil rights campaigner the Rev Al Sharpton spoke to a crowd which included his widow Esaw, who collapsed in tears. He said: &quot;Even if police procedures don't kick in, when does your sense of humanity kick in? Have we gotten so cold?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York commentator Denis Hamill said the video was &quot;disturbing proof of how far we have not come since Rodney King&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King was beaten by Los Angeles police officers after a high-speed car chase in 1991. The beating was captured on film and the later acquittals of four officers triggered riots a year later in which 53 people died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's mayor Bill de Blasio has delayed a holiday in Italy to also start an investigation. He has pledged to restore relations between police and the black community, who claim &quot;stop and frisk&quot; tactics unfairly target them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, a 6ft 3in married father of six known as Big E and Teddy Bear, was captured on video last Friday by a passer-by, causing public outrage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Common Dreams has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton announced Wednesday that every member of the department will undergo mandatory retraining on the use of force after the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a Long Island man who died in police custody after being put into a chokehold--a move that has been banned since 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's death prompted public outrage when a viral video showed officers using a chokehold to arrest Garner for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes, an example of the kind of petty crime targeted by the NYPD's highly criticized &quot;broken windows&quot; approach to policing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, was asthmatic; in a video recording of the confrontation, he gasps, &quot;I can't breathe, I can't breathe&quot; at least eight times as he is dragged to the ground and restrained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Staten Island District Attorney's Office has launched a criminal investigation into Garner's death. Two NYPD officers were suspended after the incident, including Daniel Pantaleo, who initiated the assault, as well as four EMTs who failed to give Garner proper medical assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo has a history of allegedly abusing his power; he has been sued twice for civil rights violations in the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's death exemplifies a consequence of the broken windows policy. The tactic operates under the idea that targeting petty and minor infractions, such as loitering, trespassing, or in this case, allegedly peddling loose cigarettes on the street, helps reduce and prevent more serious crimes like assault and murder. Bratton has cited it as the cause of a drastic reduction in crime during the 90s, when he previously served as police commissioner. In a disturbing parallel to Garner's case, Bratton's first tour also saw the death of Anthony Baez, an asthmatic black man, who was killed when an NYPD officer put him in a chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why does the NYPD see fit to throw someone in a chokehold over 50 cent cigarettes?&quot; <BR>--Jose Trujillo, New Yorkers Against BrattonCritics of the policy have said it has not significantly helped in reducing the crime rate in New York and other big cities, and that it perpetuates widespread racial discrimination and increases risk of police brutality in otherwise nonviolent encounters. As Columbia law professor Patricia J. Williams wrote for The Nation, &quot;New Yorkers have lived in the shadow of broken windows policing for two decades, during which time the policy has intimidated, dispossessed and humiliated millions of innocent people,&quot; also noting that it led to the implementation of New York's infamous and unconstitutional stop-and-frisk policy. A 2006 study by the University of Chicago found that there was &quot;no support... for the proposition that broken windows policing is the optimal use of scarce law enforcement resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a rally on Monday, Brooklyn College sociology professor Alex Vitale called it an example of over-policing and racial profiling. &quot;There is very little support for the idea that broken windows policing in and of itself is responsible for the crime drop,&quot; Vitale said. &quot;[It] over-polices communities of color and criminalizes young black and Latino men in particular.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jose Trujillo, a leader of the activist group New Yorkers Against Bratton, spoke at the rally as well, asking, &quot;Why does the NYPD see fit to throw someone in a chokehold over 50 cent cigarettes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not just that harassment or inconvenience of being stopped,&quot; Trujillo said. &quot;There are real physical threats to our bodies every single day, and until you live in our communities, you won't know that reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, told Reuters that Garner was &quot;a casualty of the 'broken windows' policing practices that are repeatedly reaffirmed as a cornerstone of policing policy in this administration. That's troubling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video, which was recorded by a bystander and friend of Garner's, Ramsey Orta, shows Garner telling the police officers that surrounded him, &quot;Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today.&quot; The officers move in on him shortly after. At a news conference on Tuesday, city councilwoman Inez Barron said that the tactic &quot;often leads to confrontations&quot; like the one between Garner and the NYPD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sign at Garner's memorial read, &quot;The NYPD never choked a banker.&quot; Reverend Al Sharpton said during a public address at the Harlem's National Action Network, &quot;There are many crises that we are dealing with, but none have impacted more and more than the recurring problem with the New York City police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's community in Long Island echoed the sentiment. A sign at his memorial read, &quot;The NYPD never choked a banker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the first time this year that the police department has made headlines for its excessive force on unarmed citizens during nonviolent misdemeanor citations. In January, officers threw an 84-year-old man to the ground in a jaywalking stop, giving him a bloody head injury and a $5 million lawsuit against the city. Bratton said he was &quot;not aware of excessive force&quot; in that incident. Meanwhile, the Civilian Complaint Review Board is investigating more than 1,000 chokehold complaints against police officers in the past five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials say Garner died of cardiac arrest, although autopsy results are still pending. Bratton said the incident showed that the NYPD needs to do &quot;a lot more, a lot more, on the issue of training.&quot; However, he continued to defend the Broken Window policy, stating, &quot;There's no change in that focus at all. That's a key part of what we're doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's funeral will be held Wednesday night in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Common Dreams has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton announced Wednesday that every member of the department will undergo mandatory retraining on the use of force after the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a Long Island man who died in police custody after being put into a chokehold--a move that has been banned since 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's death prompted public outrage when a viral video showed officers using a chokehold to arrest Garner for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes, an example of the kind of petty crime targeted by the NYPD's highly criticized &quot;broken windows&quot; approach to policing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, was asthmatic; in a video recording of the confrontation, he gasps, &quot;I can't breathe, I can't breathe&quot; at least eight times as he is dragged to the ground and restrained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Staten Island District Attorney's Office has launched a criminal investigation into Garner's death. Two NYPD officers were suspended after the incident, including Daniel Pantaleo, who initiated the assault, as well as four EMTs who failed to give Garner proper medical assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo has a history of allegedly abusing his power; he has been sued twice for civil rights violations in the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's death exemplifies a consequence of the broken windows policy. The tactic operates under the idea that targeting petty and minor infractions, such as loitering, trespassing, or in this case, allegedly peddling loose cigarettes on the street, helps reduce and prevent more serious crimes like assault and murder. Bratton has cited it as the cause of a drastic reduction in crime during the 90s, when he previously served as police commissioner. In a disturbing parallel to Garner's case, Bratton's first tour also saw the death of Anthony Baez, an asthmatic black man, who was killed when an NYPD officer put him in a chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why does the NYPD see fit to throw someone in a chokehold over 50 cent cigarettes?&quot; <BR>--Jose Trujillo, New Yorkers Against BrattonCritics of the policy have said it has not significantly helped in reducing the crime rate in New York and other big cities, and that it perpetuates widespread racial discrimination and increases risk of police brutality in otherwise nonviolent encounters.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 23--What can the NYPD do to avoid more horrors like the one that unfolded last week when cops confronted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a rap of selling untaxed cigarettes, scuffled with him, then wound up standing idly by as he lay dying? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facing citywide outrage, Commissioner Bill Bratton has ordered retraining in the use of force for all 35,000 NYPD officers. That's a strong idea, but success depends on the program's quality and on the NYPD's dedication to making the training stick -- on every beat in every precinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We hope the trainers focus especially on ways to defuse tensions in fraught situations like takedowns. The goal should always be to bring a suspect into custody without escalating tempers and dangers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say it's often better to wait out a raging suspect than force a fight by wrestling the subject into handcuffs. It's also important to make sure a suspect -- as well as bystanders -- grasp exactly why cops are making an arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clarity and reason often work better than brute force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exhibit A: The NYPD's Emergency Service Unit, which has been praised over the years for the way it has learned to dial down the drama and routinely bring emotionally disturbed people into custody safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exhibit B: The effort to reduce injuries from NYPD firearms discharges. NYPD officers in 1971 shot and killed 93 subjects and wounded 221, according to departmental records. NYPD officers in 2012 shot and killed 16 subjects and wounded 14. What changed? The brass demanded more firearms safety training and made it happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no reason why Bratton, with a major sustained push for training, can't reduce use-of-force incidents on the street and keep the public and officers safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By handling force better, the NYPD will be in a stronger position to defend its unyielding stance against quality-of-life crimes. Bratton believes tolerance of small crimes allows criminal behavior to escalate. He has plenty of evidence on his side. But why use force to arrest a man like Garner merely on charges of selling untaxed smokes? There are better ways to handle such situations. The NYPD needs to find them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 23--Another video in which police officers appear to punch a man and put him in a chokehold while in the process of making an arrest circulated online Wednesday, less than a week after a 43-year-old Staten Island man died in police custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said they are investigating the video in which 22-year-old Ronalds Johns is allegedly punched in the face several times by an officer in an East Harlem subway station on July 14. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johns was charged with theft of services -- for allegedly entering the station without paying -- resisting arrest and criminal trespass, according to court records. He allegedly refused to provide identification, court records said, and officers had to use pepper spray to subdue him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest, police said, is under investigation by the Internal Affairs Bureau. Johns' attorney could not be reached for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the video, which is in two parts, Johns is being held on the ground of 125th Street station while one officer attempts to put handcuffs on him. A second officer appears to hit Johns in his face and tells him to &quot;stop resisting&quot; as several bystanders scream &quot;why do you have to hit him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same officer then appears to put Johns in a chokehold, with both arms wrapped around his neck, and tells Johns to &quot;put your hands behind your back.&quot; Several splatters of red can be seen on the ground beneath Johns' face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practice of chokeholds has been banned in the NYPD for many years. The video went public after it was sent to a community activist and posted to Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're holding his head,&quot; one bystander can be heard saying. &quot;Relax man. You're partner is telling let him go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Staten Island father </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, died shortly after several officers tried to arrest him for allegedly selling individual, untaxed cigarettes. One officer, Daniel Pantaleo, allegedly placed Garner, who was overweight, in a chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His badge and gun were taken away and was he placed on modified duty after the incident, police have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday Police Commissioner William Bratton ordered a &quot;top to bottom&quot; review of all department training practices and use of force procedures. Bratton said he is sending a group to Los Angeles, where he led the LAPD for several years, to study their tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The department really does need to do a lot more, a lot more, in the area of training,&quot; Bratton said at a media briefing. &quot;I would anticipate that coming out of this effort that there will be a retraining of every member of the New York City Police Department in the weeks, months and potential years ahead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Lynch said in a statement the PBA is &quot;supportive&quot; of the retraining efforts, but added &quot;what we don't need is training that only tells us what we can't do when a person resists arrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second, unidentified officer who was present during the incident, was also placed on desk duty. As part of the investigation, the two EMT's and two paramedics from Richmond University Medical Center who responded to the incident were suspended without pay and barred from responding to 911 calls, said a hospital spokeswoman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the incident, which was also caught on video, Garner was adamant about not being arrested before Pantaleo allegedly put him in a chokehold. Garner's head and body are then held to the pavement and he can be heard repeatedly saying, &quot;I can't breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo has been embroiled in civil rights litigation before, according to court records.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 23--The three open cases against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who died while in police custody last week after allegedly being placed in a chokehold, were dismissed Wednesday, said a spokesman from the Staten Island district attorney's office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pending cases, which have now been dismissed and sealed, included selling untaxed cigarettes, driving without a license, and possession of marijuana, said a law enforcement official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, 43, died Thursday shortly after several officers tried to arrest him for allegedly selling individual, untaxed cigarettes. The officer who allegedly placed Garner in a chokehold, Daniel Pantaleo, had his badge and gun taken away and was placed on modified duty, police have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second, unidentified officer who was present during the incident, was placed on desk duty. As part of the investigation, the two EMT's and two paramedics from Richmond University Medical Center who responded to the incident were suspended without pay and barred from responding to 911 calls, said a hospital spokeswoman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolman's Benevolent Association, the police's union, called Pantaleo's modified duty a &quot;completely unwarranted, kneejerk reaction for political reasons and nothing more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the incident, which was caught on video, Garner was adamant about not being arrested before Pantaleo allegedly put him in a chokehold, which is banned practice in the NYPD. Garner's head and body are then held to the pavement and he can be heard repeatedly saying, &quot;I can't breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday Police Commissioner William Bratton ordered a &quot;top to bottom&quot; review of all department training practices and use of force procedures. Bratton said he is sending a group to Los Angeles, where he led the LAPD for several years, to study their tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The department really does need to do a lot more, a lot more, in the area of training,&quot; Bratton said at a media briefing. &quot;I would anticipate that coming out of this effort that there will be a retraining of every member of the New York City Police Department in the weeks, months and potential years ahead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Lynch said in a statement the PBA is &quot;supportive&quot; of the retraining efforts, but added &quot;what we don't need is training that only tells us what we can't do when a person resists arrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo has been embroiled in civil rights litigation before, according to court records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo, and the city, settled a $30,000 lawsuit in January with two Staten Island men who accused of him, and other officers, of unlawfully stopping their vehicle in 2012, frisking them and ordering a &quot;humiliating&quot; strip search in public. And in February a $1 million civil rights suit, which is still open, was filed in federal court in Manhattan against Pantaleo and the city, according to court records.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who died in police custody last week after he was put in an apparent chokehold, was suspected of committing the relatively minor crime of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes on the street. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The encounter was an unintended consequence of the New York Police Department's embrace of the policing tactic called &quot;Broken Windows&quot; - the idea that going after smaller crimes such as public drinking or graffiti helps stop greater disorder such as assault and murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Garner's death has put Broken Windows under renewed scrutiny, with some lawmakers and experts saying the decades-old theory no longer applies to a city with far less crime, unnecessarily puts nonviolent people at risk and fuels tensions in the city's minority communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it's a necessary police tactic,&quot; City Councilman Andy King said Tuesday during a news conference about Garner's death. City Councilwoman Inez Barron added that such enforcement &quot;leads to confrontations like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tactic caused a stir even before Garner's death. An 84-year-old pedestrian on Manhattan's Upper West Side who tussled with police officers trying to stop him for jaywalking earlier this year ended up with a bloody head injury. He's since filed a $5 million claim against the city alleging he was assaulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Garner case has turned up the heat. His arrest was captured on a widely distributed amateur video that appears to show an officer putting the asthmatic, 350-pound father of six in a banned chokehold after he refused to be handcuffed. He can be heard yelling, &quot;I can't breathe!&quot; as several officers take him down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Autopsy results are pending on a death that has sparked protests, a criminal probe and a warning by the Rev. Al Sharpton that Garner's family would explore asking for a federal civil rights investigation. The family held a candlelight vigil Tuesday night on the eve a funeral set for Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The criticism comes at a time when the new administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio has sought to ease tensions between police and minorities by curtailing the department's widespread use of street stops of young men - so-called stop and frisk - as a strategy to curb crime. De Blasio's pick for police commissioner, William Bratton, uses Broken Windows as an alternative tool to help keep crime rates at historic lows. Bratton vowed on Tuesday to stick with the program.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days after the death of a man who was subdued by police officers on Staten Island, the Police Department is undertaking a sweeping review of its training and tactics, Commissioner William J. Bratton said on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior police official said one change under discussion was the expanded use of Taser stun guns, which are available to a small number of New York officers but have been controversial here and elsewhere because of the risk they can pose to people with heart problems and other medical issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said stun guns could be a way to provide officers with more options for subduing people who were resisting arrest and avoiding the close contact that can lead to serious, even fatal, injuries to officers and suspects. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters at Police Headquarters, Mr. Bratton said the goal of the review was ''to develop state-of-the-art use-of-force policies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remarks came as he addressed investigations into the death of the man on Staten Island, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43. Mr. Garner died on Thursday after officers who had been trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes forced him to the ground. In a widely viewed video of the encounter, one of the officers appeared to use a chokehold -- banned by the Police Department -- to subdue Mr. Garner, who was heard repeatedly saying, ''I can't breathe.'' Other video taken later appears to show Mr. Garner unconscious and unresponsive to police officers and emergency medical workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical examiner's office is conducting an autopsy to determine what caused the death of Mr. Garner, who weighed 350 pounds and had health problems including asthma. Pathologists will seek to determine whether the chokehold contributed to his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Staten Island district attorney's office is investigating Mr. Garner's death, and the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau is examining the conduct of the officers. The officer who appeared to use a chokehold has been stripped of his badge and gun, and an officer who helped hold down Mr. Garner has been placed on desk duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Bratton said he had met with F.B.I. officials in New York ''to discuss their monitoring of this matter.'' Mr. Bratton added that he expected the episode would ultimately be reviewed by federal prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bratton said that next week he would visit the Police Academy to see the presentations that officers receive on how to ''take people down'' and ''take them into custody.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his remarks, Mr. Bratton did not mention Tasers, and it was not clear whether internal discussions about expanding the use of Tasers predated the episode on Staten Island or were in response to it. ''There have been conversations, but nothing definitive,'' said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal policy debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Police Department has been warier of Tasers than have many departments elsewhere. Stun guns have a scandal-tainted history in New York. In the 1980s, an early-model stun gun was used to force drug suspects to confess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emergency Service Unit officers, who are highly trained and handle many of the department's emergency calls regarding emotionally disturbed people, began carrying Tasers shortly after the 1984 death of Eleanor Bumpurs, a disturbed woman who was shot to death by the police after she threatened officers with a knife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the use of stun guns grew around the country, the Police Department modestly expanded their use. In 2008, the department instructed some sergeants to wear Tasers on their gun belts instead of storing them in the trunks of police cruisers, as had been the practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move stemmed in part from a study the department commissioned in 2007 after an unarmed Queens man, Sean Bell, was shot dead by officers. Among the recommendations in the study, conducted by the RAND Corporation, was that the Police Department consider making Tasers more widely available to officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But months after the police began to expand the use of Tasers, an emotionally disturbed man in Brooklyn fell to his death after the police shot him with a Taser. In that September 2008 episode, the man, Iman Morales, had engaged in a 30-minute standoff with the police, waving a fluorescent light bulb from a building ledge. A lieutenant on the scene ordered another officer with the Emergency Service Unit to fire a Taser at Mr. Morales, who fell headfirst to the sidewalk. Within days, the lieutenant, Michael W. Pigott, killed himself.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the midst of the storm of denunciations directed at cops for their handling of a Staten Island man who died while being arrested, we hope people keep in mind one fact: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be alive today if he hadn't resisted arrest.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The 6-foot-5, 350-pound father of six was approached by plainclothes cops who, responding to complaints from local merchants, tried to arrest him for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He denied the accusation, accused cops of harassing him and defiantly declared: &quot;I'm tired of it. It stops today.&quot; In other words, Garner made clear that he was not going peacefully. As NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said: &quot;I do not expect my officers to walk away&quot; from such situations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That doesn't make his death any less a tragedy. But just as criminals are entitled to a presumption of innocence, so too are police. We await the results of the investigation, and we are confident Commissioner Bratton will do the right thing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What worries us is how this case is being used by those who have an interest in painting the NYPD as enemies of the people. So instead of focusing on what happened between the cops and Garner, some are claiming this is part of a long pattern of police abuse. And thanks to the City Council, they can now sue.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> death is a terrible loss for his family and friends. And if cops are found to have behaved wrongly, we'll support strong disciplinary action. What The Post will not support is the hijacking of a tragic incident to advance an ideological campaign aimed at smearing a police force that's made New York America's safest big city.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A man's death after a possible police chokehold has prompted a sweeping review of the NYPD's use of force - with &shy;every officer set to be retrained and teams flown to Los Angeles to study the LAPD's tactics.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton demanded a &quot;top to bottom&quot; review of police procedure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The department really does need to do a lot more, a lot more, in the area of training,&quot; he said Tuesday. &quot;How do we train our officers for a takedown? How do we train them to use the various levels of force that they're authorized to use: less than lethal, nonlethal, lethal?&quot; added Bratton, the former LA police chief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The commish noted that there have been hundreds - and possibly more than 1,000 - complaints against city cops over neck holds alone in the past several years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Staten Island dad </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, died Thursday after a cop trying to arrest him possibly put him in an illegal chokehold.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the cop, Daniel Pantaleo, may escape serious charges in the case - because his hands never appeared to lock around Garner's neck, police sources told The Post Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NYPD probers &quot;are trying to determine whether it was technically &quot;a chokehold or a submission hold,&quot; an important distinction, because chokeholds are specifically barred under department guidelines, a source said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The rules don't refer to &quot;submission holds,&quot; which include headlocks, a common practice by city cops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;That's something that's in play,'' the source said. &quot;If you look at the video, the officer has one arm around his neck and the other arm is hooked underneath Garner's arm. Does this meet the criteria of a chokehold?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A preliminary autopsy has shown that neither Garner's windpipe nor neck bones were damaged in the encounter. Still, the hold around his neck could have caused his death by aggravating the 6-foot-5, 350-pound man's pre-existing conditions, which included diabetes, obesity and asthma, according to sources from the Medical Examiner's Office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Authorities are still awaiting the final results of the autopsy, which may not be completed for up to two weeks while the ME conducts toxicology tests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, the FBI is &quot;monitoring'' the NYPD's probe into Garner's death - and may open its own investigation, law- enforcement sources said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The feds are so concerned about the handling of the case that the head of the FBI's New York office, George Venizelos, personally talked with Bratton, a source said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the issues into which the feds would be looking is whether any civil-rights violations were committed by the cops against Garner, sources said.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Got weed? John Pica apparently did: He's now in custody after a Sunday pot bust gone awry, where a rookie cop lost several teeth after being shoved down a flight of stairs.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The cop and her partner were making a routine arrest in an East Harlem housing project; at least one perp resisted. Pica, a 26-year-old petty criminal and alleged cop-fighter, was arrested Monday - charged, not for the first time, with assaulting an officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The incident has received far less attention than the in-police-custody fatality on Staten Island last week, and understandably so.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After all, the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric &shy;Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, in a street fight with cops is a tragedy, no two ways about it. But it shares with the Pica case a question most New Yorkers thought had been answered long ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That is, when cops seek to make a legitimate arrest, and the subject refuses to submit - as was emphatically the case with Garner - what next?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police Commissioner William Bratton says his officers won't walk away from such a challenge - and he's right: They mustn't.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though it's an open question how this works as the de Blasio administration steadily back-pedals away from two decades of aggressive policing practices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet while the Garner case is (quite properly) under intense investigation, for the time being it's something of an outlier. Cigarette loosies and chokeholds are at best peripheral to the NYPD's work and New York's fractious public-safety debate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not so two key elements of the Pica case - pot and public housing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l Ongoing federal &quot;civil-rights&quot; litigation is seeking precisely to reduce the police presence in the city's housing projects - on the grounds that it has a disparate negative impact on minorities, so many of whom live in the projects.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's a bit of a head-scratcher, since that police presence is meant to protect residents from the rampant crime in many of those projects. But, hey, the argument was enough to kill stop-and-frisk, and there's no real reason to think the suits won't effectively evict cops from the projects, either. And if they're not policing the projects, they're not stopping anyone from toking in the halls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l Kenneth Thompson, the new Brooklyn DA, has declared that most low-level marijuana busts in his borough simply won't be prosecuted. If his hands-off-weed policy had been in effect citywide, there likely would have been no confrontation in the first place. After all, why make a marijuana arrest if there will be no prosecution? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All in all, then, things are looking up for John Pica and his associates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Which is not to equate the perverse housing-project litigation (with its potentially lethal consequences) with Thompson's views on low-level pot busts. The DA is in range of a provocative public-policy debate, even if he's also revealed an upside-down understanding of what the rule of law really means. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thompson says that NYPD pot policies unfairly target minorities. It's a clich&eacute; claim, yet to be convincingly proven - but there's no doubt that marijuana enforcement is a source of profound tension between the police and the policed in New York City. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And not just in New York. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Weed is ubiquitous, as are most other illegal recreational narcotics. If effectiveness is a fair measure of policy success, it's pretty clear that drug prohibition has been a lost cause in America for a long time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Is it time to call the whole thing off? Or most of it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That seems to be what Thompson - who took office in January - is suggesting with his selective-prosecution policy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He says his office is culling hundreds of old arrest forms and appearance tickets with a view toward tossing most of them before moving directly toward an explicit no-prosecute policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He's on shaky ground here. While DAs have a lot of discretion, they really aren't meant to nullify legitimately enacted laws simply because they find them distasteful. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That is, one borough can't be allowed to secede from law enforcement; defendants in the other four surely will notice - and so will their lawyers. Equal protection lawsuits are certain to follow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anyway, a general refusal to obey a given law is no reason to ignore violations - even if that law seems pointless and wrong-headed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, if Thompson is indeed seeking to force a debate on New York's drug laws, good for him. Here's hoping he succeeds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the meanwhile, though, he's obligated to enforce them - all of them - and he shouldn't lose sight of that. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All officers in the NYPD will be retrained in the use of force following a police chokehold last week on a 35-year-old Staten Island man who later died, Police Commissioner William Bratton said yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking with reporters at NYPD headquarters, Bratton said the department had &quot;to do a lot more, a lot more in the area of training&quot; and he ordered a top-to-bottom review of what preparation the NYPD gives its 35,000 uniformed personnel. Bratton also said he would be sending a team to Los Angeles to study how that department revised its use-of-force training methods after controversies over police use of force there led to a federal consent decree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extensive retraining ordered by Bratton, which could take years, comes as the NYPD has faced its first serious controversy under his command over the use of force before the death of 350-pound </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who died of apparent cardiac arrest after the officers tried to arrest him over illegal cigarette sales. Amateur video images showed officer Daniel Pantaleo using what Bratton said was a chokehold, a tactic banned by the NYPD more than two decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While announcing steps to quell criticism of the department's use-of-force training, Bratton said he didn't think race played any role in the chokehold incident as state Sen. Bill Perkins (D-Manhattan) stated at a rally yesterday outside City Hall. Garner was black and Pantaleo is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I personally don't think that race was a factor in the incident involved in this tragic death,&quot; Bratton said. &quot;Certainly the issue of race is one that is first and foremost in this country in so many ways, it is something we cannot ignore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said NYPD training going forward would include increased minority representation in the force as well as increased cultural sensitivity programs for officers so that policing is &quot;consistent&quot; in all ethnic and racial communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton also said that he won't back down from his adherence to the so-called broken window theory of policing - which aims to halt minor crimes such as fare evasion and unlicensed street vending to prevent more serious crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no change in that focus at all,&quot; Bratton said firmly. &quot;It is a key part of what we are doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's briefing for the media capped a busy day in which Bratton and some of his senior commanders traveled to Staten Island to talk with borough commanders and clergy. Bratton noted that Garner's wake and funeral will take place today at Bethel Baptist Church in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton wouldn't talk about the specifics of the Garner incident because of a pending criminal investigation by Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan. He also has met with FBI officials who are monitoring the case in what is expected to be full-blown civil rights investigation by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. (Photo: NYC Council/William Alatriste) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito would not declare that race was the factor in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, echoing comments Police Commissioner Bill Bratton made yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very disturbed by what has happened. I am not going to draw any conclusions yet,&quot; Ms. Mark-Viverito told the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Observer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at City Hall today. &quot;Obviously, training has to happen as has been indicated. I believe that justice has to be served here. What we've seen in the videos is very clear and so I'm not going to go beyond that at this point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Mark-Viverito's more tempered comments on Mr. Garner, a 43 year-old Staten Island man who died after police officers placed him in what appeared to be an illegal chokehold, were in stark contrast to what several elected officials charged at City Hall yesterday. Members of the council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, along with State Senator Bill Perkins, hinted much more strongly that the death of Mr. Garner, who was black, had at least some tie to his race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The murder by a New York City Police Officer-maybe not in blue, undercover, once again-has raised a question of racism. I cannot believe that if this brother was not black that a chokehold would have been used against him,&quot; Mr. Perkins, a Harlem Democrat, said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilwoman Inez Barron agreed with Mr. Perkins at the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't happen to white folks. It happens to black folks,&quot; Ms. Barron said. (Her husband, former Councilman Charles Barron, has called for Mr. Bratton's resignation.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The encounter between Mr. Garner and police was caught on videotape. Ms. Mark-Viverito, unlike Public Advocate Tish James, would not say that all encounters between the police and civilians should be videotaped, implying that the monetary costs of such an undertaking may be too great.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's something that's been an ongoing conversation,&quot; she said. &quot;In terms of taping every interaction, I mean that's going to be have to be discussed more thoroughly. There's obviously costs involved and it takes a lot of additional resources to be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speaker attended a vigil for Mr. Garner yesterday and said she will attend a wake for him tonight.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National First Responders Organization has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of Internet sites that allow law enforcement to air out issues are expressing outrage and offense over public reaction to last week's death of a New York City man after police administered a chokehold, which is against police department policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was overweight at 350-400 pounds and battling asthma, many posters on the sites TheeRant and PoliceOne.com said the Staten Island father and husband brought his death last Thursday upon himself. They said his health contributed to his cardiac arrest, and that their interpretation of an eyewitness video of Garner's altercation with police last Thursday was that he resisted arrest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said they suspected Garner of selling untaxed cigarettes when they approached him on a sidewalk. He told them he'd done nothing wrong. He was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meantime, the family of Garner, 43, prepared for a funeral slated for Wednesday evening in Brooklyn at which the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist, was scheduled to speak. Police Commissioner William Bratton said during a briefing Tuesday that officers would receive training on the use of violence at that some of his investigators had spoken with the FBI. Bratton said he would not be surprised if the agency opened a civil rights investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As developments continued to evolve, reaction simmered and brewed on the two law enforcement sites. In one comment, a poster referred to &quot;Stop and Frisk,&quot; a former policy that allowed members of law enforcement to stop anyone on the street who they deemed suspicious. Opponents of the policy argued that it unfairly targeted young minority men while former Mayor Michael Bloomberg hailed it as an effective crime deterrent. Users of the sites are allowed to post anonymously but they are required to register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On PoliceOne.com, one person wrote, &quot;Mayor you killed our effectiveness on the street, when you killed Stop and Frisk. Because of a few bleeding heart liberals and a few ethnic groups who believe they are the only ones being stopped. You shut down the whole system. Because now all those baggy ... pants you see walking around are probably locked and loaded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another referred to a video tape of Garner's altercation with police that went viral. On the tape, Garner is heard saying eight times &quot;I can't breathe&quot; as police press his head into the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you can talk you can breathe! A strong and deadly choke hold would not allow a person to talk,&quot; the poster wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrote another person, &quot;Again if Mr walking heart attack had simply put his hamburger shovels behind his back, he wouldn't have had a heartbattackmfor (sic) over exerting himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a site called Thee Rant, someone wrote, &quot;He probably never worked a legit job. The city will pay off the family and they will be in (racial epithet) heaven for the rest of their lives!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrote another, &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">ERIC</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">GARNER</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Yeah! Sure you are! A Nordic/Germanic given name and Anglo-Saxon surname! How dare you steal our names! You are hereby posthumously renamed MOBUTU TAKANUKU!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two emergency medical technicians and two paramedics who work for Richmond University Medical Center, where Garner was pronounced dead, have been suspended without pay and two police officers who were on the scene have had their guns and badges taken away while an internal affairs unit investigates. The Staten Island District Attorney's office also is investigating.</SPAN></P>

While the visual image of this man's final moments are disturbing, they are, unfortunately, not uncommon in many communities around our country.<BR><BR>&quot;The problem with this incident - and others like it - is that it is part of systemic failures that leave men of color particularly vulnerable to abuse by authorities. In this regard our nation continuously falls short of the very values it was founded upon. We cannot rest when statistics show that African-Americans are twice as likely to be arrested and almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with the police. Mistreatment at the hands of those we rely on for protection is an unacceptable reality for too many. I will continue to push for change; too many lives are at stake.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON, D.C.--Congressman Gregory W.

While the visual image of this man's final moments are disturbing, they are, unfortunately, not uncommon in many communities around our country.<BR><BR>&quot;The problem with this incident - and others like it - is that it is part of systemic failures that leave men of color particularly vulnerable to abuse by authorities. In this regard our nation continuously falls short of the very values it was founded upon. We cannot rest when statistics show that African-Americans are twice as likely to be arrested and almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with the police. Mistreatment at the hands of those we rely on for protection is an unacceptable reality for too many. I will continue to push for change; too many lives are at stake.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National First Responders Organization has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of Internet sites that allow law enforcement to air out issues are expressing outrage and offense over public reaction to last week's death of a New York City man after police administered a chokehold, which is against police department policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was overweight at 350-400 pounds and battling asthma, many posters on the sites TheeRant and PoliceOne.com said the Staten Island father and husband brought his death last Thursday upon himself. They said his health contributed to his cardiac arrest, and that their interpretation of an eyewitness video of Garner's altercation with police last Thursday was that he resisted arrest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said they suspected Garner of selling untaxed cigarettes when they approached him on a sidewalk. He told them he'd done nothing wrong. He was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meantime, the family of Garner, 43, prepared for a funeral slated for Wednesday evening in Brooklyn at which the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist, was scheduled to speak. Police Commissioner William Bratton said during a briefing Tuesday that officers would receive training on the use of violence at that some of his investigators had spoken with the FBI. Bratton said he would not be surprised if the agency opened a civil rights investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As developments continued to evolve, reaction simmered and brewed on the two law enforcement sites. In one comment, a poster referred to &quot;Stop and Frisk,&quot; a former policy that allowed members of law enforcement to stop anyone on the street who they deemed suspicious. Opponents of the policy argued that it unfairly targeted young minority men while former Mayor Michael Bloomberg hailed it as an effective crime deterrent. Users of the sites are allowed to post anonymously but they are required to register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On PoliceOne.com, one person wrote, &quot;Mayor you killed our effectiveness on the street, when you killed Stop and Frisk. Because of a few bleeding heart liberals and a few ethnic groups who believe they are the only ones being stopped. You shut down the whole system. Because now all those baggy ... pants you see walking around are probably locked and loaded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another referred to a video tape of Garner's altercation with police that went viral. On the tape, Garner is heard saying eight times &quot;I can't breathe&quot; as police press his head into the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you can talk you can breathe! A strong and deadly choke hold would not allow a person to talk,&quot; the poster wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrote another person, &quot;Again if Mr walking heart attack had simply put his hamburger shovels behind his back, he wouldn't have had a heartbattackmfor (sic) over exerting himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a site called Thee Rant, someone wrote, &quot;He probably never worked a legit job. The city will pay off the family and they will be in (racial epithet) heaven for the rest of their lives!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrote another, &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">ERIC</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">GARNER</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Yeah! Sure you are! A Nordic/Germanic given name and Anglo-Saxon surname! How dare you steal our names! You are hereby posthumously renamed MOBUTU TAKANUKU!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two emergency medical technicians and two paramedics who work for Richmond University Medical Center, where Garner was pronounced dead, have been suspended without pay and two police officers who were on the scene have had their guns and badges taken away while an internal affairs unit investigates. The Staten Island District Attorney's office also is investigating.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians were suspended without pay Monday as officials proceed with investigating the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a New York street peddler who died in police custody last week after being arrested for allegedly selling loose cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emergency services workers are not public employees but work for the Richmond University Medical Center in Staten Island, where Mr. Garner was declared dead after New York Police Department officers apparently put him in a chokehold. The workers, who responded to the scene, may not have followed standard emergency protocols as Garner, a 350-pound black man, lay motionless on the street. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emergency workers' inaction, combined with the chokehold that police officers may have used to subdue the neighborhood's well-known and well-liked father of six, has continued to fuel community outrage over Garner's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death has also resparked minority complaints about the tactics of the NYPD, including stop-and-frisk and the &quot;broken windows&quot; theory of policing, pioneered by Commissioner William Bratton during his first tenure in New York two decades ago. The theory focuses on penny-ante misdemeanors in high-crime neighborhoods to create a sense of law and order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why does the NYPD see fit to throw someone in a chokehold over 50 cent cigarettes?&quot; said Josmar Trujillo, a community activist from Rockaway Park, Queens, at a rally outside City Hall Monday. &quot;It's not just that harassment or inconvenience of being stopped. There are real physical threats to our bodies every single day, and until you live in our communities, you won't know that reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two police officers at the scene have also been placed on desk duty this week, with pay, as internal affairs officers continue to investigate the arrest. The officer who allegedly placed Garner in the chokehold is Daniel Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran who has been accused of civil rights violations in at least two lawsuits this year, including one settled in January for $30,000. After last week's incident, he was ordered to turn in his badge and gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill de Blasio, now vacationing in Rome with his family, told reporters following him that he is committed to a full investigation, refusing to pass judgment on the actions of the NYPD.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I ... emphasize that you need a full investigation, because all sides need to be heard and all evidence looked at,&quot; he said, adding that, though he is no expert, police indeed appeared to use the prohibited restraining technique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, who had a long rap sheet of petty offenses over the years, including marijuana possession and driving without a license, became unconscious after Officer Pantaleo put him in a headlock while at least three other officers wrestled him to the ground. During the incident, which was captured by numerous smart-phone videos taken by bystanders, Garner can be heard gasping, &quot;I can't breathe,&quot; repeatedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time the emergency workers arrived, Garner was lying unconscious on the sidewalk, his hands cuffed behind his back. But paramedics and EMTs did nothing but check his pulse with their fingers before at least six police officers and medical personnel grabbed his arms and legs and slung him onto a stretcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, state protocol is that if someone's having difficulty breathing, you're supposed to give them supplemental oxygen,&quot; Israel Miranda, president of the Uniformed EMTs, Paramedics &amp; Fire Inspectors F.D.N.Y. Local 2507, told The New York Times. &quot;Based on the video, I didn't see anything being done at that point.&quot; Mr. Miranda's union does not represent the suspended workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EMS workers are supposed to ensure that an unconscious, unresponsive patient's air passages are clear and then provide oxygen, medical experts say. They should also place a cervical spine collar on stricken patients - especially to protect the neck after a chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some reason, the gurney was not lowered to ground level, as most are equipped to do, and Garner's head slumped backward as officers and medical workers struggled clumsily to sling his 350-pound frame to the stretcher, which was above waist level, a video of the incident shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They did the most inartful transfer of a patient to a stretcher that I've ever seen,&quot; Dr. Alexander Kuehl, former head of New York's Emergency Medical Services, told the Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For activists, such indifference has long typified the way police officers and emergency workers approach their communities, even as the NYPD devotes more time and resources to battle low-level crimes in high-crime, mostly minority neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include felony arrests for possessing small amounts of marijuana, which has been mostly decriminalized since the 1970s. However, during stop-and-frisk pat-downs, officers can instruct individuals to empty their pockets. Once they do, any marijuana then becomes &quot;in open view,&quot; a felony misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police make these kinds of arrests almost exclusively in minority neighborhoods, and more than 85 percent of those arrested are black or Latin men. Surveys consistently show that whites consume as much or more of the drug.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NYPD has never choked a banker,&quot; has become a refrain among many community members since Garner's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a recent random check of hundreds of arraignments in New York City courts, 100 percent of those booked on other minor violations, such as smoking in prohibited spaces or taking two seats on a subway car, were minorities, according to the&nbsp;Police Reform Organizing Project, a Manhattan-based community organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Bratton has also gone after unauthorized subway performers, who sing or dance or for money on platforms and trains. Arrests of these mostly minority performers are up 700 percent since he began his second tenure in January, according to Alex Vitale, a professor at Brooklyn College, who wrote an op-ed for the New York Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If de Blasio is serious about reducing inequality, he has to do something to dial back the aggressive targeting of poor people of color by the NYPD,&quot; wrote Professor Vitale, who has studied the effects of broken windows policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If not, he will exacerbate the inequalities he's vowed to reduce and undermine police authority,&quot; he continued, &quot;making officers' jobs more difficult and dangerous and leading to tragic outcomes like the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By J. DAVID GOODMAN</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 16</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">815 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 2009 to 2013, an oversight board substantiated nine complaints by people who said New York City police officers restrained them with a chokehold, a banned tactic that may have played a role in the death of a Staten Island man last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each of the nine cases, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent agency that investigates police misconduct, recommended that the Police Department pursue the strongest form of punishment for the officers: an administrative trial, which could lead to termination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the police commissioner has the final say in such cases, and in all but one of the cases decided, the officers were not disciplined, or were given the lightest possible sanction: a review of the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department's response in the nine cases, documented in monthly reports by the board, raised uncomfortable questions for the Police Department, which prohibits chokeholds because of the risk of serious injury or death, but in practice appears to treat the maneuver as little more than a lapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How the department treats officers in such situations has come under new scrutiny after the death of the Staten Island man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who was held by an officer in an apparent chokehold on Thursday. The officer, Daniel Pantaleo, was stripped of his badge and gun as an investigation into the death goes on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video of the arrest, apparently for selling untaxed cigarettes, appeared to show Officer Pantaleo wrapping his arm around the neck of Mr. Garner, who had been arguing with officers and objecting to being arrested. The two men fell to the ground, and other officers joined in restraining Mr. Garner as he said he was not able to breathe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two emergency medical technicians and the two paramedics who responded to Mr. Garner have been suspended without pay, the Richmond University Medical Center said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said the video appeared to show a chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Each case must be considered as to the specifics of the underlying actions,'' said Stephen Davis, the department's top spokesman. ''The circumstances vary as to a number of different variables, 'dangerousness' being just one of them, the nature of the 'chokehold' being another.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bratton has said the practice, more common in the 1980s before many departments banned its use, had not been a problem in the first six months of his tenure. He told reporters Friday that officers were officially reminded last year that chokeholds are not allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the ban, complaints of officers' using chokeholds have steadily come before the review board. From 2009 to 2013, the board received 1,022 such complaints. In nine of those cases, investigators were able to find evidence to back up the complaint and bring it to the attention of the department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of the nine substantiated cases were not immediately available, except for the precincts where they occurred and the basics of the dispositions. Most took place in the Bronx and Brooklyn; none were on Staten Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The review board recommended that each officer be brought before an administrative court, on the fourth floor of Police Headquarters, where a department judge would rule in the case. If found guilty, the officer would face suspension or possible termination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in two cases of chokeholds, in 2009 and in 2010, the department under Raymond W. Kelly, then commissioner, declined altogether to pursue an administrative trial, effectively deciding not to discipline the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In three cases, from 2009 to 2011, officers were issued ''instructions'' by Mr. Kelly, a designation that amounts to retraining on the rules. One officer retired before a judgment could be ruled, and two cases from 2013 are still pending a decision in an administrative trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One pending case began with plainclothes officers approaching a man for riding his bike on a Queens sidewalk in January 2012, and ended with the officer and the man wrestling on the ground. The man said the officer held him in a chokehold for more than a minute; the officer has denied doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only once in the last five years, August 2009, did Mr. Kelly issue a modest punishment against an officer for a chokehold, a command discipline that carried a loss of vacation days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Mr. Bratton has not had to decide whether and how to discipline an officer for a chokehold. There is no set time, after a trial, for the police commissioner to render his decision. In the previous administration, such decisions could take up to a year. The last time a person died from an apparent chokehold was 1994; Mr. Bratton was commissioner then as well. A federal jury eventually convicted the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least one complaint reported to the department in 2014 has been substantiated so far: a case in February in the 77th Precinct in Brooklyn. In that case, the review board recommended charges. A trial has yet to be scheduled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> died in police custody last week on Staten Island, critics fixed their attention on the chokehold that an officer appeared to use to subdue him during a confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the days since, as another video of the encounter emerged, the conduct of the two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians who responded has also come under considerable scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the emergency medical workers were suspended without pay by their employer, the Richmond University Medical Center, as the hospital and the Fire Department -- which coordinates emergency medical response citywide -- review the incident. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspensions are the latest fallout from the death of Mr. Garner on Thursday in the Tompkinsville section of Staten Island. The officer who appeared to use the chokehold, a banned tactic, has been stripped of his badge and gun. Another officer, who helped hold Mr. Garner down, has been placed on desk duty. And Internal Affairs investigators are examining the roles of other officers who were at the scene of the fatal encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers from the 120th Precinct were trying to arrest Mr. Garner for selling loose cigarettes, but he complained angrily that they were harassing him, and he made clear he did not want to be taken into custody. One of the officers came up behind Mr. Garner, put his arm around his neck and pulled him to the ground as other officers moved in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once on the ground, Mr. Garner began to complain that he could not breathe; by the time an ambulance arrived minutes later, he appeared to be unconscious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emergency medical workers appear to act without urgency or intensity in assessing Mr. Garner as he lay on the sidewalk outside a Bay Street beauty salon. That response has added to public anger over the death and has fueled criticism by experts in emergency medicine. One concern expressed by some experts is that the emergency medical workers were intimidated by a large police presence and as a result failed to follow protocol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One medical worker appears in the video to do little more than feel Mr. Garner's wrist and neck for a pulse before helping to lift him onto a stretcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It was like she either didn't want to be there, which is hard to understand, or police basically told her to just let him alone,'' said Dr. Alexander Kuehl, who led the Emergency Medical Services in New York City during the 1980s. ''She certainly didn't do her job.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a typical situation, medical experts said, medical personnel would have been expected to ensure that Mr. Garner's airway was clear, to check that he was breathing and to monitor his circulation. Emergency workers' tentative approach, the experts said, may have kept Mr. Garner from receiving vital treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Obviously, state protocol is that if someone's having difficulty breathing, you're supposed to give them supplemental oxygen,'' said Israel Miranda, president of the Uniformed EMTs, Paramedics and Fire Inspectors F.D.N.Y. Local 2507, which does not represent the workers involved. ''Based on the video,'' Mr. Miranda added, ''I didn't see anything being done at that point.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not yet clear what information emergency medical workers were given about Mr. Garner's condition when they were dispatched or what they discovered when they arrived. Responding to an onlooker's question about why no one was administering C.P.R., a police officer on the video said that Mr. Garner was breathing. Mr. Garner appeared to be unconscious when the first emergency medical technician arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of Mr. Garner's condition, the medical workers' apparent hesitancy struck medical experts as unusual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical workers in that situation would have been expected to take over the scene by removing Mr. Garner's handcuffs and checking his breathing, Dr. Kuehl said. In this case, he added, surrounded by a large group of police officers, the emergency medical worker may have taken her cue from the officers and skipped critical steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''She's totally overawed by the cops,'' Dr. Kuehl said. ''She doesn't do her assessment at all. There was something very peculiar about her approach.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the police officer's assurance in the video, Dr. Kuehl said, there was no sign that Mr. Garner was breathing, and emergency medical technicians did not appear to check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typical protocol would have dictated that emergency medical technicians use an oxygen mask to facilitate breathing for an unresponsive patient, medical experts said, and even apply a cervical spine collar to protect the neck in the aftermath of the chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video did not show the emergency medical worker who knelt next to Mr. Garner with any such equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garner's size -- he weighed 350 pounds -- complicated the response by both medical workers and the police. But experts said that the medical workers appeared to ignore the risks to Mr. Garner's neck and spine by having him heaved onto a stretcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They did the most inartful transfer of a patient to a stretcher that I've ever seen,'' Dr. Kuehl said. ''If he had a broken neck, he would've had a severed spine no matter what after that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Rubenstein, a personal injury lawyer who has been involved in high-profile cases of police misconduct, said on Monday that Mr. Garner's family had retained his services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Litigation over the death would be a long way off, but observers say that New York State case law sets a high bar for holding emergency medical workers accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff has to show, among other things, that the emergency medical worker knew that inaction could lead to harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You'd think sometimes that the law is a little unkind when it seems so clear-cut that they had a responsibility here,'' said Michael Levine, president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigations are not complete and pictures can mislead. But it is hard to imagine that the videos show anything but what seems chillingly obvious: a group of New York City police officers killing an unarmed black man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, on a sidewalk in Staten Island. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers confronted Mr. Garner last Friday, accusing him of illegally selling cigarettes. Bystanders' videos posted online show Mr. Garner yelling at them to leave him alone. A plainclothes officer throws a choking arm around Mr. Garner's neck and brings him to the ground. The officer seems to be trying to mash his head into the pavement as Mr. Garner keeps saying, ''I can't breathe.'' Other officers pin his arms, and he goes still. The spasm of violence then gives way to a queasy calm, as officers stand around waiting for paramedics to haul their silent victim away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bystander asks: ''Why nobody do the CPR?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good question. But Mr. Garner is dead, and the Police Department is caught up in a scandal evoking memories of the overbearing, sometimes brutal policing of the 1980s and '90s, particularly the death of Anthony Baez, choked by a cop for throwing a football around. This is not what Mayor Bill de Blasio promised when he campaigned on restoring tattered trust in police-wary neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. de Blasio and the police commissioner, William Bratton, say there will be a thorough investigation into Mr. Garner's death. The undercover officer, Daniel Pantaleo, had to surrender his badge and gun; another officer was put on desk duty. Two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians were placed on modified duty. The Civilian Complaint Review Board, meanwhile, has promised to re-examine the last five years of chokehold complaints. The board received 1,022 such complaints since 2009 and substantiated nine of them, recommending administrative trials for the credibly accused officers. But, in all but one of those cases, they received the lightest sanctions or no punishment at all. This is not reassuring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should go without saying that neighborhoods should feel protected by law enforcement, and that officers should be expert at defusing conflicts and avoiding lethal violence. The mayor and Mr. Bratton were already facing a daunting job in repairing the department's reputation in black and Latino neighborhoods. They can start by determining whether the fatal encounter on Staten Island was a brutal aberration, or part of a larger problem.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the takedown of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, on Staten Island reverberates across the metropolitan area, it is clear that New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton faces a huge challenge to train America's largest police force in the art of &quot;active listening&quot; and in addressing &quot;the needs of people asking for help.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio really change entrenched police attitudes? Actually, they don't have much choice. Many city residents were already angry about the NYPD's stop, question and frisk program championed by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. De Blasio and Bratton sought to defuse that fury with a program encouraging cops to treat citizens with more respect as the city also ratchets up enforcement of quality-of-life crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Garner case indicates that old attitudes run deep. A cellphone video that went viral last week shows a police officer using what looks like a banned chokehold to subdue the 350-pound suspect after cops approached him for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they take Garner down, he protests repeatedly that he can't breathe. Then he is still. In a second video, we see officers standing over Garner for several minutes without offering aid. That video also shows cops chatting jovially in the background while Garner lies unmoving on the sidewalk. And perhaps worst of all, it shows the plainclothes cop who grabbed Garner around the neck waving sarcastically to the camera. When an ambulance crew arrives, we see no attempt to aid Garner's breathing. He's rolled away and later pronounced dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caution is advised about judgments. We don't know yet exactly what caused Garner's death. And we don't know why cops and ambulance workers seemed slow to act. The Staten Island district attorney and the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau - among others - are investigating. But what's indelible are those shots of NYPD officers standing around while a man dies. Bratton faces a huge job.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Autopsy results in the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Staten Island man who died after police used an unauthorized chokehold when arresting him last week, could be released as early as tomorrow, a law enforcement official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner died apparently of cardiac arrest after he got into a scuffle with police trying to arrest him on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes on a sidewalk near the Staten Island Ferry terminal. Amateur video captured one officer, identified as Daniel Pantaleo, using what Police Commissioner William Bratton said was a chokehold banned by the NYPD for more than 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the city medical examiner would only say yesterday that there were no updates about the status of the autopsy on Garner, who weighed 350 pounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Sanford Rubenstein of Brooklyn, who said he was representing Garner's family in possible legal action against the city and the NYPD, said Garner's funeral is scheduled for tomorrow evening at Bethel Baptist Church, 265 Bergen St., Brooklyn, at 7 p.m. A private wake will be held from 2 to 6:45 p.m. at the church, Rubenstein said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo has been stripped of his badge and gun and placed on desk duty while Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan conducts a criminal investigation, officials said. A spokesman for Donovan said yesterday the investigation was ongoing. Another officer involved in the case was placed on modified assignment, as were four emergency medical technicians working for Richmond University Medicial Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill De Blasio, who is in Rome with his family to vacation and visit with Italian government representatives, said it appeared to him that Garner had been put in a chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's an internal process and I respect that process. I think the fact is that Commissioner Bratton acted having looked at the facts, and you know, it's quite clear that the chokehold has been prohibited for decades,&quot; DeBlasio told reporters in Rome. &quot;But I leave the specific actions within the police department to Commissioner Bratton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo recently faced other allegations of misconduct. Earlier this year, the city settled a lawsuit brought by Darren Collins and another man, who claimed that during a 2012 traffic stop Pantaleo illegally had them undergo degrading strip searches in public and filed criminal charges which were later dismissed. Federal court records show the case was settled in January for an undisclosed sum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan, another Staten Island man, Raylawn Walker alleged that Pantaleo had him improperly arrested on charges that were later dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Colihan, the attorney representing Walker, couldn't be reached for comment Monday. Walker was reportedly arrested on a marijuana charge. A spokesman for the NYPD declined to comment on the case Monday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton. (Photo: Andrew Burton/Getty)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the assertions&nbsp;of elected officials who said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would not have died in police custody if he were&nbsp;not a black man, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said he does not believe race played a role in the man's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I personally don't think that race was a factor in the incident involved in this tragic death,&quot; Mr. Bratton told the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Observer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bratton's comments came after several elected officials at a City Hall rally, including State Senator Bill Perkins and Councilwoman Inez Barron, said Mr. Garner would not have been stopped and placed in a chokehold by NYPD officers if he were white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't happen to white folks. It happens to black folks,&quot; Ms. Barron observed at one point during the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garner, 43, of Staten Island, died after police used an apparent chokehold to take him to the ground during an arrest for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes in Staten Island. The encounter and its aftermath were caught on video by bystanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Certainly the issue of race is one that's first and foremost in this country, in so many ways, and it's something that we cannot ignore,&quot; Mr. Bratton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that didn't mean it was an issue in this particular case, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think the issue of race entered into this at all, based on the circumstances that I watched on that video,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioner met with top police officials in the department's training bureau Tuesday, before also meeting with community leaders on Staten Island at the office of Councilwoman Debi Rose. He said the department's members will need re-training well beyond just the precinct at issue in Mr. Garner's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I've reviewed that incident and I've reviewed the training in the department, it it is my belief that we're going to have to do more than just a review of Staten Island,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bratton said he'd order a &quot;top-to-bottom review of all the training that this department provides to all of its personnel, specifically focusing on initially, use of force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bratton said that training would help relations between communities and the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only will we have cultural sensitivity, but that our officers will understand the importance of consistent policing - no matter whether the area is black, Asian Latino, white, it's the consistency in the enforcement of the law,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while some have pointed to the &quot;broken windows&quot; theory of policing - going after quality of life violations - as the next stop-and-frisk controversy, particularly given the nonviolent crime Mr. Garner was being arrested for, Mr. Bratton defended the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said he wouldn't measure its success in the number of arrests, but on whether crime goes down - pointing out that quality of life problems plaguing neighborhoods can be solved sometimes by asking someone to move along, or telling them what they are doing is illegal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers should better understand the discretion they have, Mr. Bratton said, in determining whether to make an arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I'm looking for is quality, not quantity,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

(Jillian Jorgensen/Observer)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside City Hall Tuesday, city and state elected officials called for justice for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - and more cameras recording cops on city streets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New York City, all street encounters should be videoed,&quot; Public Advocate Tish James declared at a rally led by the City Council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus. &quot;All street encounters should be videoed to avoid this from happening again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garner, 43, died after police used what appears to be a chokehold to bring him to the ground during an arrest for selling untaxed cigarettes. The incident was caught on camera by several civilians and the video - which Mayor Bill de Blasio declared he was &quot;very troubled&quot; by - was widely circulated by news organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am unable to turn away from this compelling indictment of man's inhumanity to man,&quot; Councilwoman Debi Rose, who represents the Staten Island district where Mr. Garner lived and died, said. &quot;When these images of blatant indifference play over and over, I am sickened by the cavalier attitude of all involved, and frightened, frightened - and so are my constituents, are frightened - that no one took pause to re-think their actions. Did they not hear what the whole world heard? The constrained cries of 'I can't breathe?' over and over and over, until there wasn't any more?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video provides a clear picture of the arrest - and both Mr. de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said it seems to show a chokehold, prohibited by NYPD rules. Several&nbsp;elected officials said, without the video, the officers involved might not had been scrutinized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Senator Bill Perkins pointed to a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Daily News</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> report showing the first reports filed by police higher-ups make no mention of a chokehold being used, or of Mr. Garner's distress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now in cases like this, it's clear that there needs to be videotaping - because the whitewash is around the corner. The body doesn't get cold before the story, the line, is created,&quot; Mr. Perkins said, to blame Mr. Garner for his behavior or his health problems.&nbsp; &quot;But it was taped by an innocent bystander. A concerned New Yorker had recorded the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police precinct where the incident took place, the 120th, was actually targeted for a pilot program suggested by federal judge Shira Scheindlin in her stop-and-frisk ruling that calls for&nbsp;cameras to be worn by police.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilman Jumaane Williams said when he was detained by police at the West Indian Day Parade, it was difficult to&nbsp;substantiate anything that wasn't on video. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there was no video for this, we would be here listening to the police account of what happened - with no chokehold mentioned,&quot; Mr. Williams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added Councilman Andy King, co-chair of the caucus: &quot;It protects everyone, the officer as well as the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, in introducing Councilman Dan Garodnick, who is white, Mr. King noted the caucus should be outraged if any New Yorker had died in&nbsp;such a way. But beside him, Councilwoman Inez Barron noted, though not into the microphones, &quot;It doesn't happen to white folks. It happens to black folks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, too, placed&nbsp;the blame for Mr. Garner's death squarely on NYPD racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The murder by a New York City Police Officer - maybe not in blue, undercover, once again - has raised a question of racism. I cannot believe that if this brother was not black that a chokehold would have been used against him,&quot; Mr. Perkins said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Rose, whose diverse district includes both many minorities, many white residents, and many police officers, quoted Marvin Gay's &quot;What's Goin' On,&quot; and said she was set to meet with Police Commissioner Bill Bratton on Staten Island this afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others noted the tension she may face in her district. Not present were Staten Island's other two Council members, Steve Matteo and Vincent Ignizio, and Staten Island Borough President James Oddo did not attend a rally held by Al Sharpton this weekend that drew several citywide lawmakers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not easy for Debi to be in Staten Island representing a community that is fractured,&quot; Council Public Safety Chair Vanessa Gibson said. &quot;But the grace of God is with her and she has a collective support that is standing with her each and every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than once during the hourlong press conference in the hot sun, elected officials said the incident would be a test for Mr. de Blasio, who was elected with the support of black and Latino voters looking for a change in how the NYPD deals with their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But so far, Ms. Rose said, she has been pleased with the administration's response - it has&nbsp;been transparent, she said, and offered her full access - and added she doesn't begrudge the mayor&nbsp;being in Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving forward, she said she was an &quot;actionable plan&quot; that includes sensitivity training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that the commanding officers in these precincts, when they recognize that they have bad actors, they should be able to bench them keep them off the street,&quot; she told the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Observer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. King, who also called for the NYPD to make Mr. Garner's family whole monetarily, added that it was key the mayor called for a fast investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want the mayor to be the leader that we know he is,&quot; Mr. King said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: ...European vacation, hopping around all these different cities instead of staying in one place, and people say you're just rushing through, you're not really experiencing one - you know - location. So if you could address both of those issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill de Blasio: Well on that point, they have a point. And my wife would agree with that point. Look, there's a great virtue in staying in one place and really getting to know it. And for me, I'm blessed because I've spent a lot of time in Rome over the years with my family. But I think for this moment it was very important to us, of course to come into Rome, but also to go to the two hometowns of our family. For the kids it was very important to go to Venice, because they are quite concerned about the future of Venice, and they [inaudible] when they'd have another chance to see it. It was important to see it now. And Capri is the most beautiful place on Earth, so that was easy. So yes, there's definitely another way of doing things, but for this moment, this was the right way for us. In terms of this morning, it was a really important and powerful meeting. Cardinal Parolin is a very, very important - in terms of [inaudible] number two official in the Vatican, and someone who has been really the person implementing so much [inaudible]. [inaudible] great respect for this Pope and what he's achieving, both within the church and around the world. So it was an honor to meet his right hand man, and especially to emphasize that it would be so important to the people of New York City to have the Pope visit, to talk about the fight against inequality - which has been such a powerful theme of the Pope's - but also as the spiritual leader of so many Catholics in our city and in the metropolitan area, it would really be a very important moment for New York. And that I personally believe his message about fighting economic inequality and his message of social inclusion, and of support for people regardless of immigration status, is something that this country - our country, America - needs to hear. And it would be our honor to host him in New York so he could have that platform. And we're hopeful, we haven't gotten a formal answer, but we're hopeful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Do you think you're going to head back to becoming a little bit more religious or [inaudible]?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: Look, I think my situation is pretty stable. I was - some newspapers have said I was baptized, I was not baptized. I wasn't brought up in the church. My grandfather's brother Alberto [inaudible] was one of the priests in town. A lot of people - when we go down there in a few days - a lot of people will - who are there who remember him as one of the town priests. And my grandfather was much less religious, even though he was a priest's brother. And my mother was brought up in the church, but she had her disagreements with the doctrine of the church, and so you know, she no longer continued attending church. And so I was not brought up in the church. But I have, like so many people of Catholic origin, a very strong cultural, emotional tie to the church and a deep appreciation for what's good about the church, and particularly what's good about this Pope. So it's philosophically very important to me, it's not something where I'm going to become a practicing Catholic, but it's something that means a lot to me personally. And I think this Pope is one of the most significant leaders on Earth in terms of messages that I've [inaudible].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Would you call yourself an atheist or agnostic?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: I don't get too deep into the labels. I think I'm spiritual but in my own way. Yes? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: So this is off topic, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, have you had an update? And also, how has it been - I know you talk about talking to your top staff in New York - what have you been doing? Are you Skyping, are you emailing, phone calls? Is the time difference -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: We've got a new device called the cellular telephone, we've been using that. I've been trying to reach Phil Walzak, he's been impossible to get. No, we've been - I've been talking of course to Tony Shorris and other staff back in New York on a regular basis. And you know, it is similar to any time I've been even in another American city, just constantly checking in. obviously Phil, Monica, Laura are here feeding me information as needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Are you getting woken up in the middle of the night very -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: We have not yet, and you know, we'll be ready of course but hopefully that won't be necessary for a lot of reasons, most importantly because we wouldn't want anything that is a problem that would require it for anyone's sake. But I think it's really a different world now. You know, you can really stay in touch very easily and we sat down at 7 this morning and had breakfast, and went over what's happening in the last reports from last night in New York, and you know, we'll be talking about it again after this. And it's just very natural to stay in touch and give direction as necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Did you get an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> update? Anything you can share with us? Do you want the police officers to lose their job?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: Well again, there's an internal process and I respect that process. I think the fact is that Commissioner Bratton acted having looked at the fact. And it's quite clear that the chokehold has been prohibited for decades, but I leave the specific actions within the police department to Commissioner Bratton. I have absolute faith in his judgment. And I think the actions that have been taken show that there is a serious commitment to a full investigation and appropriate follow through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Do you think there was a chokehold after looking at the video?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: As an individual who is not expert in law enforcement, it looked like a chokehold to me. But you know, I also emphasize that you have a full investigation because all sides need to be heard and all evidence has to be looked at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phil Walzak: Let's do one or two more, on Italy please.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: After meeting all these public elected officials, and after having called yourself a European style social democrat, do you feel at home also politically here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: Of course. Of course. If you remember, I didn't say that I'm one thing, I think we're all complex people and the European social democracy has been an important influence for me, as have [inaudible]. You remember - the quote you're borrowing from I also talked about Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the New Deal being a very important influence, and liberation theology being an important influence. So of course I feel at home. I mean there's a - in my family, there was a such a strong reference point to Italy, and particularly to the hometowns of our family, that when I'm here I feel a very strong connection. I wish my mother were still here, but when I'm here I feel a certain closeness to her because she always talked about her love of Italy and her hometown - her father's hometown. And my grandfather was a very important figure in my life [inaudible]. So I feel a closeness to family here, and that's very powerful. And in terms of the political thought pattern, I feel like someone like Mogherini is someone I feel very kindred with. Certainly Marino, there's an instant connection that I feel because we share a philosophical core. But I also think they're extraordinary individuals, and leaders I admire for their ability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: I remember reading that you might have had a photograph of him visiting Capri in the 1950s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: I do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: I'm wondering, on the island, are you planning to retrace any of his steps. And are there any general attractions there you're intrigued by? I don't know if you're a beach person or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: I've been known to go to the beach, alla spiaggia. Capri, from what I've seen of the world, is arguably the most [inaudible]. And anything in Capri is [inaudible]. I just love to walk around it. I am a particular fan of the - it sound strange, but there's a chairlift that goes up to the highest point -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Funicular.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: No, no, there's a funicular from the port up to the main square, but then there's a chairlift, you go up. There's a chairlift that goes up to the highest point. It is mystical. You look out, you see the Mediterranean out around you and it's incredibly peaceful and beautiful. And as a family, we also walked down, I think it's 880 steps that go from one of the highest points down to the port. You can walk the whole way down, and we did that as a family last time. I'm not sure we'll do it this time, but we did it last time. It was wonderful. So it's an incredible place, and just anything there is wonderful. But I think I'll just be - you know, walk around, and just get the feeling of the place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: [inaudible]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: Yeah I don't know from the photo exactly where my grandfather was, and I haven't been able to ascertain it. But that was probably 1953, 1955. And it certainly, for people who come from Naples and the surrounding areas, it's like going to Montauk. Or if you live in Boston, going to Cape Cod. You know, Capri is like an island really nearby and it used to not be as well know. At the point where that photo, it's a bunch of family members around a table at some trattoria in Capri, and it used to just be a place you went on a weekend or in summer. But it's a wonderful sense of just going to a place that my family grew [inaudible].</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Emergency Medical Services has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FDNY placed four EMS workers -- two EMTs and two paramedics -- on modified desk duty Sunday as part of the investigation into the death of a Staten Island man who was placed in a chokehold by a police officer while being arrested last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EMS workers, who were not identified, are privately employed by the Richmond University Medical Center, said an official with knowledge of the investigation. They will not be allowed to respond to 911 calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, died while in police custody Thursday after being arrested and placed into a chokehold for allegedly selling individual, untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a high-profile case so we're looking at the response and the operation of that case,&quot; the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Officer Daniel Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran of the NYPD, had his badge and gun taken away and was placed on modified duty, police said. A second, unidentified officer who was present during the incident, was placed on desk duty, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolman's Benevolent Association, the police's union, called Pantaleo's modified duty a &quot;completely unwarranted, kneejerk reaction for political reasons and nothing more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sermon Sunday, Rev. Al Sharpton called on other religious leaders to take action, citing video footage captured during in the incident in which Garner can apparently be heard repeatedly gasping &quot;I can't breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: ...European vacation, hopping around all these different cities instead of staying in one place, and people say you're just rushing through, you're not really experiencing one - you know - location. So if you could address both of those issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill de Blasio: Well on that point, they have a point. And my wife would agree with that point. Look, there's a great virtue in staying in one place and really getting to know it. And for me, I'm blessed because I've spent a lot of time in Rome over the years with my family. But I think for this moment it was very important to us, of course to come into Rome, but also to go to the two hometowns of our family. For the kids it was very important to go to Venice, because they are quite concerned about the future of Venice, and they [inaudible] when they'd have another chance to see it. It was important to see it now. And Capri is the most beautiful place on Earth, so that was easy. So yes, there's definitely another way of doing things, but for this moment, this was the right way for us. In terms of this morning, it was a really important and powerful meeting. Cardinal Parolin is a very, very important - in terms of [inaudible] number two official in the Vatican, and someone who has been really the person implementing so much [inaudible]. [inaudible] great respect for this Pope and what he's achieving, both within the church and around the world.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 21--The takedown of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, on Staten Island last week is the strongest sign yet that NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton faces a huge challenge as he tries to train America's largest police force to practice the art of &quot;active listening&quot; and to &quot;address the needs of people asking for help.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio truly change entrenched police attitudes? Actually, they don't have much choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the public was already angry about the NYPD stop, question and frisk program championed by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio and Bratton sought to defuse that fury with a much-publicized program encouraging police to treat citizens with dignity and respect. That would build sufficient trust for the department to ratchet up its enforcement of minor, quality-of-life offenses, the thinking went.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal is to improve police work, to enhance community relations, and to drive crime rates even lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Garner case says old attitudes run deep. A cellphone video that quickly went viral shows a police officer using what looks like a banned chokehold to subdue the 350-pound suspect after they approached him for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes, a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they take Garner down, he protests repeatedly that he can't breathe. Then he is still. We see officers standing over him for several minutes without offering aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, other cops chat jovially in the background while Garner lies still.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bystander asks why the police aren't giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation to the handcuffed man as they wait for an ambulance. A policeman answers that Garner is breathing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps worst of all, one video shows the plainclothes cop who grabbed Garner around the neck waving sarcastically to the person making the video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an ambulance crew arrives, the video shows no attempt to administer oxygen or take other measures to make sure Garner is breathing properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is rolled away on a stretcher and later pronounced dead later at Richmond University Medical Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caution is advised about judgments. We don't know yet exactly what caused Garner's death. We don't know why cops and ambulance workers seemed slow to act. The Staten Island district attorney and the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau -- among many others -- are investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what's indelible are those shots of NYPD officers standing around while a man dies. Bratton faces a huge job.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 21--The officer at the center of the controversy surrounding the choke hold and death of a Staten Island man last week has been embroiled in civil rights litigation before, according to court records. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel Pantaleo, and the city, settled a $30,000 lawsuit in January with two Staten Island men who accused of him, and other officers, of unlawfully stopping their vehicle in 2012, frisking them and ordering a &quot;humiliating&quot; strip search in public, according to court records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday Pantaleo allegedly placed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a choke hold while trying to arrest him for allegedly selling illegal cigarettes. According to video footage of the arrest, Garner, handcuffed and on the ground, started complaining he couldn't breath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo was put on modified desk duty and had both his badge and gun taken away following the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Friday. A second officer was also placed on desk duty and four EMS workers were placed on modified duty following the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical examiner has yet to determine a cause of death in that incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the March 2012 lawsuit filed in Brooklyn Federal Court, the two men, 45-year-old Darren Collins and 42-year-old Tommy Rice, said they were forced to pull their pants and underwear down, squat and cough at about 10 a.m., but said they did not have any weapons or illegal substances on them. Collins and Rice said they were then taken to the local precinct and forced to remove all of their clothing, squat and lift their genitals, according to court records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said they were held until the next day and &quot;suffered physical pain and mental anguish&quot; over the incident, court records said. These incidents were first reported by the Staten Island Advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February a $1 million civil rights suit, which is still open, was filed in Manhattan Federal Court against Pantaleo, the city, and one other officer by Rylawn Walker, according to court records. Walker accused Pantaleo of arresting him in 2012 for marijuana-related offenses, but contends he was not committing a crime, the Advance reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the New York City Law Department, which represented Pantaleo in both cases, declined to comment on the Walker suit. The spokesman did not return a request for comment on the Collins, Rice lawsuit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 21--Complaints about chokeholds reviewed internally by the NYPD resulted mainly in a slap on the wrist, according to data compiled by the Civilian Complaint Review Board. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 10 substantiated incidents involving chokeholds from 2009 to 2014, three resulted in the officer being sentenced to retraining and one resulted in a loss of at least 10 vacation days, according to the CCRB data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD declined to internally try two of the cases. And three cases are still pending. In the last case, the officer either resigned retired before a ruling was made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, died while in police custody in Staten Island after being arrested and allegedly placed in a chokehold by Officer Daniel Pantaleo. Garner was being arrested for allegedly selling individual, untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran of the NYPD, had his badge and gun taken away and was placed on modified duty, police said. A second, unidentified officer who was present during the incident, was placed on desk duty and four EMS workers who responded to the incident were placed on modified duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following Garner's death, CCRB said they will review the more than 1,000 chokehold allegations they received from 2009 to 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances surround the 10 substantiated cases were unclear. They mostly took place in Brooklyn and the Bronx and did not include any cases from Staten Island precincts, where Garner died.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of a New York City man who was allegedly placed in a chokehold by a police officer last week has reignited discussions about an arrest tactic that has been outlawed in most police departments and linked to dozens of in-custody deaths. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has unleashed torrents of criticism. On Saturday, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Garner's family led a march on a police precinct in Staten Island, N.Y.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four emergency responders have been put on modified duty while authorities investigate their response to the incident, a Fire Department official said Sunday. The two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians will not be allowed to respond to 911 calls, Reuters reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Generally, officers in most major American police departments are not allowed to use chokeholds to subdue suspects, law enforcement experts said. But while struggling with a suspect, an officer may look to end a confrontation in a way least likely to result in injury to officer and suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Struggles between police officers and resisting individuals are not choreographed events,&quot; said Wayne Fisher, a professor of police studies at Rutgers University. &quot;They occur spontaneously, and it's quite possible that an officer's arm could wind up around somebody's throat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner was approached by officers who were investigating the sale of untaxed cigarettes Thursday. Videos show Garner, 43, pleading with officers to leave him alone before one applies what appears to be a chokehold. Garner crumples to the ground, according to one video, and says, &quot;I can't breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Police Department outlawed chokeholds in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference held the day after Garner died, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton said the maneuver appeared &quot;to have been a chokehold,&quot; but said the incident required further investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eugene O'Donnell, a former district attorney in Brooklyn and Queens, N.Y., said the situation with Garner may not be as clear as many suggest. Garner appeared to be resisting arrest, O'Donnell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this case the guy is 350 pounds ... on the video, the guy clearly won't allow himself to be handcuffed, and if you look at that particular video, the cops look awfully small compared to him,&quot; he said. &quot;So how do you get someone to allow themselves to be handcuffed quickly so he and you don't get hurt? I'm not sure any department has a great secret formula.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - Four emergency workers involved in the medical response for a New York City man who died in police custody after being put in an apparent chokehold have been placed on &quot;modified duty&quot; and barred from responding to 911 calls, the Fire Department of New York said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two EMTs and two paramedics removed from the city's emergency response system are the latest public safety workers to face reassignment as questions mount about Thursday's death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Two police officers - including the one who put his arm around Garner's neck - have put on desk duty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The modified duty restrictions will remain in effect pending an investigation into the medics' actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video of the arrest shot by a bystander shows one officer wrap his arm around Garner's neck as he is taken to the ground - arrested for allegedly selling untaxed, loose cigarettes - while Garner shouts, &quot;I can't breathe!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fire department disclosed the medics' reassignment after a second video surfaced showing at least a half-dozen police officers and emergency workers circling a man who appears to be Garner lying on the sidewalk, handcuffed and unresponsive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long said placing the emergency workers on modified duty - which includes a notice in their state health department file that they are not to respond to medical calls - is department protocol when questions arise about a medical response and was not a reaction to the post-arrest video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fire department said the emergency workers are employees of Richmond County Medical Center, the Staten Island hospital where Garner was taken by ambulance and pronounced dead. Authorities said the father of six likely had heart attack, but more tests are needed to determine the exact cause and manner of his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Richmond County Medical Center spokeswoman did not immediately respond to messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long said the fire department took action against the hospital's emergency responders because it oversees the city's 911 system, a patchwork of public and privately-operated emergency services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restrictions on the medical personnel came a day after the police department said it reassigned Officer Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who used the apparent chokehold on Garner, and another unidentified officer while prosecutors and internal affairs detectives investigate. Chokeholds are banned under department policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department said it stripped Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran of the force, of his gun and badge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Court records show that within the past two years, three men sued Pantaleo in federal court over allegedly unlawful, racially motivated arrests. Pantaleo did not return a telephone message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Sunday, the Rev. Al Sharpton demanded justice for Garner and accountability from citizens who attack police officers during an appeal from the pulpit at Manhattan's Riverside Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner was &quot;choked by New York City policemen,&quot; the Harlem preacher told the congregation. &quot;What bothers me is that the nation watches a man say 'I can't breathe' and the choking continues, and police surround him and none of them even say, 'Wait a minute, stop! He can't breathe!&quot;'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's funeral is scheduled for Wednesday at the Bethel Baptist Church in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video of Garner's struggle with police obtained by the New York Daily News shows the 6-foot-3, 350-pound man becoming irate and refusing to be handcuffed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, who has been arrested for illegally selling cigarettes numerous times in recent years, told the officers who confronted him that he had not done anything wrong, according to the video of the arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time you see me, you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today,&quot; Garner shouts. &quot;I'm minding my business. Please just leave me alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, as four officers bring him down to the sidewalk, Garner, who was asthmatic, gasps, &quot;I can't breathe! I can't breathe!&quot; The video shows one officer using his hands to push Garner's face into the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second video, which appears to have been shot shortly after Garner was handcuffed, shows him lying on the sidewalk, apparently unresponsive. More than three minutes in, medics arrive and one checks his pulse. Garner is lifted onto a gurney and transported to a waiting ambulance about two minutes later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bystander asks why no one is performing CPR and one officer responds, &quot;because he's breathing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - In a Sunday appeal from the pulpit, the Rev. Al Sharpton demanded justice for a man he said was choked to death by New York City police but added that citizens who attack police officers also should be held accountable. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALBANY (AP) - A new documentary examines what led to the 2009 arrests on terrorism charges of four Hudson Valley men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men were approached by an FBI informant and asked to join his plans to bomb a Jewish synagogue and shoot down U.S. military planes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documentary, airing 9 p.m. today on HBO, includes footage from FBI cameras showing informant Shahed Hussain promising to pay $250,000 to the men, who were poor and from Newburgh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director David Heilbroner, a former Manhattan prosecutor, examines whether the FBI, under pressure after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, solicited hapless, reluctant participants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALBANY (AP) - U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer says pet owners could save millions of dollars on prescriptions for their animals if they could buy the drugs at ordinary pharmacies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Democrat says Sunday that he's working with U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on legislation that would require veterinarians to write prescriptions to allow owners to buy the medication at a pharmacy or online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schumer says many owners pay too much for pet medications because veterinarians don't provide prescriptions unless asked and sell the drugs themselves at much higher prices than pharmacies. He says pet owners in the U.S. spend $10 billion each year on pet medications and other health-related products.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deep rifts between the New York Police Department and the city's minority neighborhoods widened further this weekend after a black man, put into a chokehold barred by police policy for at least two decades, died in police custody last week after an arrest for a petty crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a married father of six and a grandfather of two, was allegedly seen selling &quot;loosies,&quot; or single cigarettes commonly peddled for up to a buck in poor neighborhoods. Two plainclothes cops in Kevlar vests, along with a number of uniformed officers, wrestled the 350-pound man to the ground, as he repeatedly gasped, &quot;I can't breathe.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the incident was captured by several onlookers who video-recorded the arrest and its aftermath from a number of perspectives. Most disturbing are those of the arrested man lying motionless on the sidewalk, his hands handcuffed behind his back, his eyes unblinking, while police officers and emergency medical services (EMS) workers stood over him without providing CPR or any other assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two New York City police officers, including the man alleged to have put Mr. Garner in the chokehold, have been placed on desk duty this week, and four emergency workers have been restricted from responding to 911 calls as the district attorney and police internal affairs unit begin to investigate Garner's death, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, the longtime civil rights activist who heads the National Action Network in Manhattan, led hundreds marching in protest in the borough of Staten Island over the weekend, as community anger mounted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is going to be a real test to see where policies are in the city now and whether the change that we feel has occurred, has occurred,&quot; the Rev. Mr. Sharpton said at the rally.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such changes in policy are a reference to the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), who won a record landslide victory last fall after campaigning with a pledge to improve the relationship between the NYPD and minority communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, Sharpton continued to speak out against Garner's death during a sermon at the historic Riverside Church in Manhattan, where he put pressure on the mayor and Police Commissioner William Bratton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Twenty years ago the mayor's name was [Rudolph] Giuliani. The commissioner's name was Bratton,&quot; Sharpton told the congregation, which included US Rep. Charles Rangel (D) of New York. &quot;Twenty years later, the mayor's name is de Blasio. The commissioner's name is Bratton. There's a lot different, 20 years later. Yet we will see a lot remains the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just over a half-year into Mayor de Blasio's tenure, tensions have remained vexed between the NYPD and the city's black and Latin communities. Last summer, controversies over the police department's aggressive stop-and-frisk tactics under the administration of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Commissioner Raymond Kelly dominated the headlines.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio was one of the few mayoral candidates to rail against the practice, promising to revamp police policies and - most important, he said again and again - improve the relationship between cops and minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Garner's death has put these efforts in jeopardy and reminded the black community of a number of high-profile police custody deaths from decades past, including from chokeholds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has really been one of our priorities, if not our priority, is to change, not necessarily the culture at [the NYPD], but also change the way we interact with the community and the way people see us,&quot; said Marco Carrion, commissioner for the Community Assistance Unit, who represented the de Blasio administration at Sharpton's rally on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics continue to fault the tactics used by Bratton, who helped revolutionize urban policing more than two decades ago during his first tenure as head of the NYPD.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton maintains a steady belief in the &quot;broken windows theory&quot; of policing, directing police to focus on minor, petty crimes - such as selling &quot;loosies&quot; on the street. This creates a sense of law and order on the streets, according to the theory, which in turn helps prevent more serious crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though serious crime has continued to fall citywide, a recent spike in nonfatal shootings in the city's public housing units this year has led Bratton to reassign as many as 400 desk officers to street beats for the next three months, in a program the department calls&nbsp;&quot;Summer All Out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, who had a history of penny-ante arrests, was already scheduled to appear in court this October after being charged with possessing marijuana and selling cigarettes illegally. The videos of Garner's arrest reveal officers employing a violent chokehold - a technique Bratton said is &quot;prohibited&quot; - as well a seeming indifference to the man as he lay motionless on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;C'mon, guy,&quot; one cop says to Garner, slapping at the large man's shoulders as he lay motionless on the sidewalk, his eyes bulging. &quot;Breathe in, breathe out.&quot; Garner does not respond as several cops stand over him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes later, a female EMS officer stands over him. &quot;Sir, it's EMS. Come on. We're gonna help, alright?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why's nobody doin' CPR?&quot; asks an onlooker, outside the video's frame, as six officers grab the man and put his slumped body on a stretcher. &quot;Cuz he's breathin,' &quot; a cop says, looking back. Garner was declared dead on arrival at a nearby hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camera then pans over to Officer Daniel Pantaleo, identified as the police officer who put Garner in the chokehold. Officer Pantaleo notices the video, mentions it to another officer, and then waves his hand sarcastically toward the person shooting the video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo has been the subject of at least two civil rights lawsuits against the NYPD this year, which allege the eight-year veteran engaged in racially motivated, brutal arrests. One case was settled for $30,000 in January, and another is ongoing. This weekend, Pantaleo was stripped of his gun and badge and assigned to desk duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've heard what is needed is more police training,&quot; said Bishop Victor Brown during a sermon at Mount Sinai United Christian Church in Staten Island, a few blocks from where Garner died. &quot;The police get enough training; a mind-set is the issue. Enough is enough. Stop killing our people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A California Highway Patrol officer straddles a woman near an exit ramp on Interstate 10 in Los Angeles. He is punching her in the face -- pummeling her like a boxer while she writhes on her back, trying to fend off the blows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chances are we would have never known anything about this July 1 incident, which has now been all over the news, were it not for the fact that a man named David Diaz happened to be driving by moments earlier. Diaz, who was in a car with three other people, stopped when he saw a CHP officer attempting to arrest a woman walking on the freeway. He turned on his cellphone and captured the officer as he started punching the woman in full view of passers-by. Diaz uploaded the video to YouTube. It went viral. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can't watch the clip of the beating -- the relentlessness of the blows -- and not be sickened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a grown man punching to the point where she could have died out there,&quot; Diaz later told KNBC 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland attorney John Burris is a member of the legal team representing Marlene Pinnock, 51, who has filed a civil rights lawsuit against the CHP. Burris, who represented Rodney King and Oscar Grant's family in civil suits where citizen video of police actions played a major role, said Diaz's cellphone video will be a key piece of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of what may have occurred in the moments before the beating, Burris says, &quot;The video shows that he (the officer) was throwing punch after punch at her while she was in a subservient position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHP Commissioner Joe Farrow has said he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; by the video and promised a prompt investigation. CHP officials have said that the video only tells part of the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the CHP, Pinnock, a homeless woman who appeared disoriented, had been wandering in and out of lanes of traffic on the freeway. She was posing a danger to herself and others. At least nine concerned motorists had called 911 to report her. The CHP said Pinnock became combative and uncooperative when the officer tried to arrest her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that may well be true, it will still be hard for the CHP to justify the vicious beating that was captured onvideo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the video is exhibit A for why citizens should have a right to videotape the police going about their official duties in public places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it's a good Samaritan looking out for another's welfare or a simple voyeur, increasing numbers of people are using their cellphones to videotape the police. Citizen video can provide valuable evidence in investigations of possible police abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Thursday, when police officers in Staten Island, N.Y., placed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a choke hold, there were people nearby recording with cellphones. The police had stopped to question Garner, 43, about the fairly minor crime of selling loose cigarettes. He ended up dead after being placed in a choke hold by two of the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A seven-minute video posted to Facebook shows Garner lying handcuffed on the ground while police wait for the ambulance to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who try to record police officers do so at their own risk.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chances are we would have never known anything about this July 1 incident, which has now been all over the news, were it not for the fact that a man named David Diaz happened to be driving by moments earlier. Diaz, who was in a car with three other people, stopped when he saw a CHP officer attempting to arrest a woman walking on the freeway. He turned on his cellphone and captured the officer as he started punching the woman in full view of passers-by. Diaz uploaded the video to YouTube. It went viral. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can't watch the clip of the beating -- the relentlessness of the blows -- and not be sickened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a grown man punching to the point where she could have died out there,&quot; Diaz later told KNBC 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland attorney John Burris is a member of the legal team representing Marlene Pinnock, 51, who has filed a civil rights lawsuit against the CHP. Burris, who represented Rodney King and Oscar Grant's family in civil suits where citizen video of police actions played a major role, said Diaz's cellphone video will be a key piece of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of what may have occurred in the moments before the beating, Burris says, &quot;The video shows that he (the officer) was throwing punch after punch at her while she was in a subservient position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHP Commissioner Joe Farrow has said he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; by the video and promised a prompt investigation. CHP officials have said that the video only tells part of the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the CHP, Pinnock, a homeless woman who appeared disoriented, had been wandering in and out of lanes of traffic on the freeway. She was posing a danger to herself and others. At least nine concerned motorists had called 911 to report her. The CHP said Pinnock became combative and uncooperative when the officer tried to arrest her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that may well be true, it will still be hard for the CHP to justify the vicious beating that was captured onvideo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the video is exhibit A for why citizens should have a right to videotape the police going about their official duties in public places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it's a good Samaritan looking out for another's welfare or a simple voyeur, increasing numbers of people are using their cellphones to videotape the police. Citizen video can provide valuable evidence in investigations of possible police abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more than two decades, all manner of chokeholds have been banned by the New York Police Department. Recruits learn not to use them in the academy; officers are periodically reminded of the ban in training materials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite its dangers, the maneuver can be effective in subduing a resisting person, and it has been tough to eliminate its use by officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, an officer gripped the neck of a Staten Island man resisting arrest for selling loose cigarettes, holding him with his arm as they fell to the ground. The man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, later died, prompting outrage and setting off a new round of scrutiny of the stubborn persistence of a banned practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garner's case immediately brought to mind the last time the city focused on a man's death after an officer's chokehold. Then, as now, Commissioner William J. Bratton led the police. It was 1994, not long after the Police Department banned the use of chokeholds, and Anthony Baez was tossing a football with his brothers in the Bronx and struck a patrol car. Soon his neck was pinned in a police officer's grip. According to the city's chief medical examiner, Mr. Baez died of asphyxiation. (The medical examiner has not yet made a determination of the cause of death in Mr. Garner's case.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal jury convicted the officer, Francis X. Livoti, of violating the civil rights of Mr. Baez, 29, who had asthma and was being arrested for disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixteen people in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Los Angeles died in cases in which a chokehold was used. A district court in Los Angeles found that using the practice in situations when serious injury is not threatened ''is unconscionable in a civilized society.'' Since then, legal experts said, the practice largely faded from public view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samuel Walker, emeritus professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, said that in a case like Mr. Garner's, ''it is extremely hard to get a criminal conviction'' because prosecutors must prove that the officer had criminal intent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Police Department's Patrol Guide is unequivocal about the use of chokeholds, saying they are not to be used in any circumstances. But officers are not taught how to subdue a large person, said Joseph L. Giacalone, a retired detective sergeant who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ''It's not easy to handcuff somebody when they don't want to be handcuffed,'' he said, adding that officers are also taught not to compress a person's chest by sitting or kneeling on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practice appears to have persisted. From 2009 to 2013, there were more than 1,000 chokehold complaints against officers with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, a city agency that investigates allegations of police abuse. Though all but nine were deemed unsubstantiated by the board, it announced on Saturday that it would conduct a thorough review to determine ''why officers continue to use this forbidden practice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The maneuver also has continued nationwide: At least 500 local police departments still train officers on using chokeholds, said Fabrice Czarnecki, a medical adviser to the National Law Enforcement Training Center.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most afternoons </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be found around Tompkinsville Park, not far from the Staten Island Ferry terminal, hawking loose cigarettes and making conversation. Police officers, too, were a familiar sight in the triangular spit of green where drug deals once dominated and fistfights and shouting matches still occasionally break out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cigarette seller and the police were far from strangers: In a city where the authorities are increasingly focused on stamping out petty offenses as a way of heading off larger ones, the local officers had tangled with Mr. Garner time and time again, arresting him for selling untaxed cigarettes at a price far below what local deli owners could offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A confrontation on Thursday that started like so many others ended with Mr. Garner's death and an eruption of anger at the police as cellphone video of the clash drew millions of eyes to a changing pocket of Staten Island. Mr. Garner's death on a sidewalk outside a beauty salon on Bay Street threw into sharp relief the tension between two pillars of Mayor Bill de Blasio's law enforcement agenda: mending frayed relations between the police and people in black and Latino neighborhoods, while holding down serious crime by assiduously attacking minor offenses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor, upon arriving in Italy on a family vacation on Sunday, found himself once again answering questions about the death. The Fire Department said two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians who responded to the scene had been placed on modified duty while their conduct was reviewed. A seven-minute video, posted over the weekend, showed emergency medical workers doing little more than feeling for a pulse before lifting Mr. Garner's body onto a gurney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the police commissioner, William J. Bratton, has suggested that the officers' actions appeared questionable, but he has defended the department's strategies as he grapples with the fallout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer who placed Mr. Garner in what appeared to be a chokehold while trying to put him under arrest, Daniel Pantaleo, was ordered to turn in his badge and gun; another officer who first approached Mr. Garner, Justin Damico, was reassigned to desk duty; and the roles of the other officers at the scene who helped wrestle Mr. Garner to the ground are under review by the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau as investigators await the results of an autopsy by the medical examiner's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To park regulars and local shop owners, it was devastatingly ironic that the police considered Mr. Garner, 43, a vestige of the disorder that still cropped up in the area, even as drug dens gave way to delis and vacant storefronts filled around the park. To them, he had been a bright spot, a peacemaker who with his size alone could -- and often did -- quell disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A funeral for Mr. Garner is to be held on Wednesday. On Sunday, in pulpits on Staten Island and in Manhattan, ministers called for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I've heard what is needed is more police training,'' Bishop Victor A. Brown told his congregation at Mount Sinai United Christian Church, a few blocks from Tompkinsville Park. ''The police get enough training; a mind-set is the issue. Enough is enough. Stop killing our people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 20 miles away in Upper Manhattan, the Rev. Al Sharpton warned city officials that the family of Mr. Garner would explore whether to get the federal government involved, even before the Staten Island district attorney had made a decision about pursuing charges in his death. A spokesman for the district attorney's office did not respond to a call seeking comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bratton has described Officer Pantaleo's arm gripping Mr. Garner's neck as a chokehold, a banned maneuver in the New York Police Department. The reassignment of the officers and the emergency medical workers came after bystander videos documented the interaction between emergency responders and Mr. Garner. They received thousands of views online, fueling outrage over the episode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two police officers were part of a plainclothes team based in the 120th Precinct, which covers the northern tip of Staten Island and some of its most diverse areas. It is also home to some of the borough's most crime-prone streets and housing developments, as well as Wagner College and the Staten Island Yankees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police have said the pair were assigned Thursday to address ''conditions'' in the area of the park -- a police term that broadly refers to local disorder and crime patterns but can also indicate particular people who are seen as drivers of crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of Mr. Garner, who was black, presents a potentially combustible mixture of race and policing for a mayor who promised to improve relations between officers and minority communities. Arriving in Rome, Mr. de Blasio received a briefing from his top aides and told reporters at the airport that delaying his departure by one day to address the death had been ''absolutely worthwhile.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defusing lingering tensions has fallen largely on Commissioner Bratton, and he has navigated between describing the death as a ''tragedy for all involved'' and defending, in general terms, the use of force to subdue suspects who resist arrest on minor charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I do not expect my officers to walk away from that type of situation,'' Mr. Bratton said on Friday, noting the local precinct had received numerous complaints about untaxed cigarettes among the hundreds of 911 calls from the area around the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of the department have described Mr. Garner's death as among the most egregious results of a ''broken windows'' approach to crime that targets low-level offenses in largely minority neighborhoods. But officials have been quick to describe Mr. Garner's death as an isolated incident. ''This is one particular interaction between two people,'' said Stephen Davis, the chief spokesman for the department. ''You can't judge the whole program on that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, area business owners said that they were frustrated by the sale of loose cigarettes but that Mr. Garner was hardly a menace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He never caused any harm to anybody, unlike a lot of people around here,'' said Adel Abouelala, 22, the manager of the Edible Arrangements store facing the park, who has worked there for two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fadal Ali, another shop owner, acknowledged giving up on selling cigarettes because there were so many men, like Mr. Garner, who could undercut him on the sidewalk. ''I can't make a profit,'' said Mr. Ali, who opened Elegant Grill and Deli opposite the park about four months ago in a spruced-up building once known for drug sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the day Mr. Garner died, he had been trying to break up a fight shortly before his confrontation with officers, said Efrain Acosta, 35, who works at the Boost Mobile store opposite the park. It was the fight, not cigarettes, that drew the police's attention, Mr. Acosta said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Four emergency-service workers who found a man unconscious on the sidewalk after a cop put him in a chokehold - and apparently did nothing to aid him - have been barred from going on any more ambulance calls pending a probe, officials said Sunday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A seven-minute video captured the last few minutes of diabetic dad </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> life - and the apparent procedural lapses by two medics and two EMTs, sources told The Post. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It was pretty obvious this patient was in distress,&quot; a source said. &quot;His body was limp and lifeless.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet none of the workers - nor the eight cops on hand - can be seen in the video administering any aid to Garner. One medic at Garner's side doesn't even have any of the required equipment on her, such as an oxygen bag or a defibrillator, the source said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;You can [only] hear her say, 'Oh, he can't walk to the bus?' &quot; the source said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner should have been immediately placed on a stretcher, and his airway, breathing and circulation checked, sources said. Instead, EMT Nicole Palmeri can be seen only checking for a pulse. She never uses a stethoscope to check his lungs for air movement, a source said, nor does she connect him to an oxygen mask. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Maybe the EMT felt a pulse, but it was obvious this male was in serious distress and needed to be assisted with his breathing,&quot; the source said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner died of cardiac arrest en route to the hospital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Palmeri and the other emergency workers are employed by Richmond University Hospital on Staten Island, but dispatched by the FDNY, which issued the restriction.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Palmeri did not return a phone message seeking comment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner - who was 6-foot-5, about 350 pounds and suffered from asthma - was suspected of illegally peddling cigarettes when cops approached him at around 5 p.m. Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Undercover Officer Daniel Pantaleo was caught on video putting him in a chokehold - a violation of NYPD procedure.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pantaleo has been named in two civil-rights law suits, one of which was settled by the city for $30,000, the Staten Island Advance reported Sunday. Pantaleo and three other officers unlawfully stopped a vehicle and strip-searched two men.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pantaleo, who has been stripped of his badge and weapon, did not return requests for comment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State NAACP President Hazel Dukes said, &quot;Communities of color are sick and tired of this familiar story. Mr. Garner is one of too many New Yorkers who have unjustly had their lives cut short by police officers.''  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of Richmond University Medical Center in Staten Island did not respond to requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, meanwhile, kept pressure yesterday on city officials to investigate the first responders at the scene of the confrontation with Garner, arrested on the suspicion of illegally selling individual, untaxed cigarettes. Sharpton, taking the pulpit at the historic Riverside Church in Manhattan, called other faith leaders to action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also asked why, according to the video footage, police officers involved continued to pin Garner down and keep him in a chokehold as Garner repeatedly gasped, &quot;I can't breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if police procedure doesn't kick in, when does your sense of humanity kick in?&quot; Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill de Blasio - who postponed his family vacation in Italy by one day to handle fallout from Garner's death, eventually leaving Saturday evening - told reporters upon his arrival in Rome yesterday that he believes Staten Island officials handled the situation well &quot;in a very difficult circumstance,&quot; communicating with the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also emphasized that a &quot;thorough investigation&quot; is being conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio was briefed by senior administration officials in the morning on the NYPD investigation into Garner's death and &quot;continued engagement with community leaders, elected officials and clergy members,&quot; his office said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said Garner's widow and mother are &quot;trying to be strong, but this is devastating&quot; and are preparing for his funeral Wednesday in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No determination has yet been made into the &quot;cause and matter&quot; of Garner's death, city Office of the Chief Medical Examiner spokeswoman Julie Bolcer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard D. Emery, chairman of the city Civilian Complaint Review Board, over the weekend announced a new study into more than 1,000 chokehold complaints received in the past five years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a Brooklyn Borough Hall rally, family of Briana Ojeda called for the passage of &quot;Briana's Law,&quot; to require NYPD officers are re-trained in CPR every two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael and Carmen Ojeda rally for &quot;Briana's Law&quot; in Brooklyn. (Jillian Jorgensen/Observer)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Carmen Ojeda - whose daughter died of an asthma attack after a police officer who pulled her over en route to the hospital allegedly told her&nbsp;he &quot;didn't do CPR&quot; - watching the video of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> struggle with police brought her back to her own tragedy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was screaming. I was crying. I feel like I failed - because I've been trying to do this for the last four years,&quot; Ms. Ojeda said, referring to her push of &quot;Briana's Law,&quot; a bill that would require NYPD officers to be re-trained in CPR every two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just hearing those words, 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe,' it's like reliving that moment over and over,&quot; Ms. Ojeda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what my daughter told her: 'Mommy, I can't breathe,'&quot; Briana's father, Michael Ojeda, said of his 11-year-old daughter, who died in 2010 when the family finally reached the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ojedas held a small rally in front of Brooklyn Borough Hall to call for passage of the bill - which made it through the Assembly last session, where it was sponsored by Assemblyman Felix Ortiz, but stalled in the State Senate. They also called for Gov. Andrew Cuomo to look into signing an executive order to mandate CPR re-training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of police using&nbsp;CPR is back in the news after the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in NYPD custody. Video shows an officer, identified as Daniel Pantaleo, using an apparent chokehold to bring the asthmatic Mr. Garner to the ground as he repeatedly says he cannot breathe. Another video&nbsp;posted online this weekend shows minutes passing by while officers do nothing to resuscitate him - with one officer telling a bystander CPR isn't being performed because Mr. Garner is breathing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's an outrage that our police officers are able to use so much aggression and not know how to save a life - but they know how to kill a life. It's inhumane,&quot; Ms. Ojeda said said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video also shows Mr.&nbsp;Pantaleo waving at the camera, an action that reminded the Ojedas of the bad attitude the officer who stopped Ms. Ojeda on the way to the hospital - she recalled him smirking at her as he daughter struggled to breathe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They&nbsp;show that they have no respect for us,&quot; Mr. Ojeda said of the actions caught on video. &quot;The test for the police officers&nbsp;should be some kind of&nbsp;different test - they should have to do some kind of moral test. It's not just read a book and do it. That's not a cop - a cop is somebody who cares.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ortiz, the assemblyman, said his mind went to Briana's death &quot;very quick&quot; when he saw the video of Mr. Garner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was completely dismayed and disappointed that we didn't mandate CPR,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the attention on Mr. Garner's death, Mr. Ortiz said, &quot;We hope that the Senate and the governor will take this issue more seriously.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years after her daughter's death, the Ojedas believe the proposed law could have saved Mr. Garner's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They call it a no-brainer,&quot; Mr. Ojeda said of lawmakers backing the bill. &quot;But four years later, the no-brainer's still not done.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEATTLE - A massive wildfire raging east of Washington state's Cascade Mountains showed some sign of calming Sunday, with fire crews saying they had slowed the expansion of a wind-whipped blaze that destroyed about 100 homes and displaced hundreds of people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Carlton Complex blaze did not grow overnight, the first time since the fire was triggered by lightning strikes six days ago that it showed any sign of abatement, local officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shootings rattle Chicago</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO - An 11-year-girl was shot and killed during a slumber party as violence struck Chicago over the weekend, local media outlets reported Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 40 people were shot, and four killed, in weekend violence in the third-largest U.S. city, the NBC affiliate in Chicago reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deaths included the girl, shot in the head inside a first-floor bedroom Friday night after someone fired a gun from outside the house, said Chicago Police Officer Jose Estrada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responders probed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Four emergency responders have been put on modified duty while authorities investigate their response to a man who died after New York police put him in a chokehold on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes, a fire department official said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians will not be permitted to respond to 911 calls while the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who was 43, is investigated, the fire department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not a department spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garner's death, the cause of which is still being determined by the city's medical examiner, has provoked outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill de Blasio, who promised to improve frayed relations between police and the public when he took office in January, called the death a &quot;terrible tragedy&quot; and promised a &quot;thorough&quot; investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ill. pot bill signed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Illinois children and adults with epilepsy soon will be allowed to use marijuana to ease their symptoms under a law signed Sunday by Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, the latest in a series of measures loosening restrictions on cannabis by U.S. states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move to add epilepsy and other seizure disorders to the list of conditions legal to treat with marijuana or its extracts comes as numerous states have made medical use of the drug legal. Two states, Colorado and Washington, have legalized its recreational use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois law, which takes effect in January, would allow children who experience seizures to be treated with non-smokable forms of cannabis, as long as they have permission from a parent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sides to meet on Canal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI - Arbitration of the first claim in a $1.6 billion dispute over cost overruns in the expansion of the Panama Canal begins today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will start with a teleconference to determine procedures, both sides' positions and a timeline. Then the impasse will be resolved by an international tribunal seated in Miami, said Carolyn Lamm, an attorney who is representing the Spanish-led consortium that temporarily stopped work on the canal this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ports throughout the Americas, including those in South Florida, are avidly following Panama's efforts to expand its canal to handle post-Panamax ships that are too long, too wide and too heavy for the current canal. And they've made big plans of their own based on the canal expansion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decades after gray seals were all but wiped out in New England waters, the population has rebounded so much that some frustrated residents are calling for a controlled hunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The once-thriving New England gray seal population was decimated by the mid-20th century because of hunting, with Massachusetts keeping a seal bounty on the books until the 1960s. But scientists say conservation efforts, an abundance of food and migration from Canada combined to revive the population. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists cheer the resurgence, saying the gray seal boost is good for biodiversity and a boon for popular seal-watch tours in coastal New England. But many fishermen say the seals interfere with fishing charters and steal catch. Beachgoers bemoan the 600-plus-pound seals taking over large stretches of shore, befouling beaches and attracting sharks, which feed on seals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some residents of Nantucket are so fed up with the huge seal population that now calls the affluent island home that they have suggested a controlled hunt, similar to the way states manage deer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservationists scoff at the idea of providing amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which protects seals. They say culling the herd would undo the results of the act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York City says four emergency workers involved in the medical response to a man who died in police custody have been barred from responding to 911 calls. The fire department said Sunday that two EMTs and two paramedics were placed on &quot;modified duty&quot; pending an investigation into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Ohio veteran who hurt his back during the Iraq War is worried a citation will result in him losing his 14 pet ducks, which he says are therapeutic. Darin Welker says officials in the village of West Lafayette told him to get rid of his ducks in May. They cited him for a minor misdemeanor June 23 for failing to comply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A California Highway Patrol officer straddles a woman near an exit ramp on Interstate 10 in Los Angeles. He is punching her in the face -- pummeling her like a boxer while she writhes on her back, trying to fend off the blows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chances are we would have never known anything about this July 1 incident, which has now been all over the news, were it not for the fact that a man named David Diaz happened to be driving by moments earlier. Diaz, who was in a car with three other people, stopped when he saw a CHP officer attempting to arrest a woman walking on the freeway. He turned on his cellphone and captured the officer as he started punching the woman in full view of passers-by. Diaz uploaded the video to YouTube. It went viral. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can't watch the clip of the beating -- the relentlessness of the blows -- and not be sickened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a grown man punching to the point where she could have died out there,&quot; Diaz later told KNBC 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland attorney John Burris is a member of the legal team representing Marlene Pinnock, 51, who has filed a civil rights lawsuit against the CHP. Burris, who represented Rodney King and Oscar Grant's family in civil suits where citizen video of police actions played a major role, said Diaz's cellphone video will be a key piece of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of what may have occurred in the moments before the beating, Burris says, &quot;The video shows that he (the officer) was throwing punch after punch at her while she was in a subservient position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHP Commissioner Joe Farrow has said he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; by the video and promised a prompt investigation. CHP officials have said that the video only tells part of the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the CHP, Pinnock, a homeless woman who appeared disoriented, had been wandering in and out of lanes of traffic on the freeway. She was posing a danger to herself and others. At least nine concerned motorists had called 911 to report her. The CHP said Pinnock became combative and uncooperative when the officer tried to arrest her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that may well be true, it will still be hard for the CHP to justify the vicious beating that was captured onvideo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the video is exhibit A for why citizens should have a right to videotape the police going about their official duties in public places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it's a good Samaritan looking out for another's welfare or a simple voyeur, increasing numbers of people are using their cellphones to videotape the police. Citizen video can provide valuable evidence in investigations of possible police abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Thursday, when police officers in Staten Island, N.Y., placed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a choke hold, there were people nearby recording with cellphones. The police had stopped to question Garner, 43, about the fairly minor crime of selling loose cigarettes. He ended up dead after being placed in a choke hold by two of the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A seven-minute video posted to Facebook shows Garner lying handcuffed on the ground while police wait for the ambulance to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who try to record police officers do so at their own risk. There have been instances of police around the country threatening and arresting those who try to record them. One website, Photography is not a Crime http://photographyisnotacrime.com/ ), is even dedicated to reporting such incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been a number of court rulings establishing that citizens have a First Amendment right to record police officers in public places. However, that won't stop you from getting arrested for trying to do so. &quot;An officer might not understand the law or says 'I don't care I'm going to arrest you anyway,'&quot; says Clay Calvert, a professor of communications at the University of Florida who specializes in First Amendment issues. &quot;Then that person is left to fight it out in court, which can take a significant amount of time and money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the value of citizen-produced video in helping to hold police officers accountable, the right to videotape the police is worth fighting for.<BR><BR>Tammerlin Drummond is a columnist for the Bay Area News Group.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A California Highway Patrol officer straddles a woman near an exit ramp on Interstate 10 in Los Angeles. He is punching her in the face -- pummeling her like a boxer while she writhes on her back, trying to fend off the blows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chances are we would have never known anything about this July 1 incident, which has now been all over the news, were it not for the fact that a man named David Diaz happened to be driving by moments earlier. Diaz, who was in a car with three other people, stopped when he saw a CHP officer attempting to arrest a woman walking on the freeway. He turned on his cellphone and captured the officer as he started punching the woman in full view of passers-by. Diaz uploaded the video to YouTube. It went viral. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can't watch the clip of the beating -- the relentlessness of the blows -- and not be sickened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a grown man punching to the point where she could have died out there,&quot; Diaz later told KNBC 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland attorney John Burris is a member of the legal team representing Marlene Pinnock, 51, who has filed a civil rights lawsuit against the CHP. Burris, who represented Rodney King and Oscar Grant's family in civil suits where citizen video of police actions played a major role, said Diaz's cellphone video will be a key piece of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of what may have occurred in the moments before the beating, Burris says, &quot;The video shows that he (the officer) was throwing punch after punch at her while she was in a subservient position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHP Commissioner Joe Farrow has said he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; by the video and promised a prompt investigation. CHP officials have said that the video only tells part of the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the CHP, Pinnock, a homeless woman who appeared disoriented, had been wandering in and out of lanes of traffic on the freeway. She was posing a danger to herself and others. At least nine concerned motorists had called 911 to report her. The CHP said Pinnock became combative and uncooperative when the officer tried to arrest her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that may well be true, it will still be hard for the CHP to justify the vicious beating that was captured on video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the video is exhibit A for why citizens should have a right to videotape the police going about their official duties in public places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it's a good Samaritan looking out for another's welfare or a simple voyeur, increasing numbers of people are using their cellphones to videotape the police. Citizen video can provide valuable evidence in investigations of possible police abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Thursday, when police officers in Staten Island, New York, placed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a choke hold, there were people nearby recording with cellphones. The police had stopped to question Garner, 43, about the fairly minor crime of selling loose cigarettes. He ended up dead after being placed in a choke hold by two of the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A seven-minute video posted to Facebook shows Garner lying handcuffed on the ground while police wait for the ambulance to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who try to record police officers do so at their own risk. There have been instances of police around the country threatening and arresting those who try to record them. One website, Photography is not a Crime,  is even dedicated to reporting such incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been a number of court rulings establishing that citizens have a First Amendment right to record police officers in public places. However, that won't protect you from getting arrested for trying to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An officer might not understand the law or say, 'I don't care I'm going to arrest you anyway,' &quot; says Clay Calvert, a professor of mass communication at the University of Florida who specializes in First Amendment issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then that person is left to fight it out in court, which can take a significant amount of time and money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the value of citizen-produced video in helping to hold police officers accountable, the right to videotape the police is worth fighting for.<BR><BR>Tammerlin Drummond is a columnist for the Bay Area News Group.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a 43-year-old Staten Islander, by police chokehold, not only sparked in me the usual combination of sadness, anger and frustration -- there was an additional element: would this do it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would the nation's shock, incredulity, indignation amount to anything?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lots of questions. But one thing not being focused on in the standard reports was noted by Scott Shackford of Reason. It's not merely a question of why the bust went so violent. Why, he asks, a bust at all? &quot;We should be concerned that the reason why the police swarmed Garner in the first place is getting lost. He allegedly possessed 'untaxed cigarettes.' That is it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tax matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police are arresting people -- and going into overkill mode in the process -- on tax matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Couldn't this such issues be handled by mere citation, followed by a court summons? With an arrest the last resort?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why go all violent when violence is not really in order?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But maybe it's not just about the taxes. Or &quot;contraband.&quot; Maybe this is also about &quot;drugs.&quot; (Yes, tobacco's a drug.) We've long had a &quot;War on Drugs&quot; in this country. It has not gone well. As I suggested last week (as well as yesterday, on Townhall), the effects have not only been wide and deep, but inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">War is like that. Expect the &quot;unintended consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott Shackford suggests that New York lower the city's high sin taxes on cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But maybe the whole mindset of the modern state needs changing. Big things, like murder, slavery, etc., those are worth fighting about. Let's not go to war over the little things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is Common Sense. I'm Paul Jacob.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> City of New York, The State of New York has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill de Blasio: Joined by Commissioner Bratton, Deputy Commissioner Ben Tucker, Chief Robert Boyce, who is Acting Chief of Department, and Corporation Counsel Zach Carter. I join you today with a heavy heart. On behalf of all New Yorkers I want to offer my deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He was a loving husband and a caring father and grandfather. This is a terrible tragedy that occurred yesterday. A terrible tragedy that no family should have to experience. And our thoughts and prayers go out to Eric's family and his friends.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like so many New Yorkers I was very troubled by the video I reviewed earlier today. I have instructed Commissioner Bratton to ensure that there will be a full and thorough investigation of this incident. We at City Hall will be working closely with Commissioner Bratton, with Richmond County DA Dan Donovan, with elected officials and community leaders--in fact we have been in constant conversation with elected officials, community leaders and clergy throughout the day. I want to note something that is true every day in New York City--the men and women of the NYPD are handed an enormous responsibility. The responsibility of keeping us safe, but also the responsibility of making very difficult, split-second decisions in trying circumstances. It is too early to jump to any conclusions about this case--we must wait for all the facts and details of the incident to emerge. But I assure all New Yorkers, there will be a full and thorough investigation. Commissioner Bratton and I are deeply committed to strengthening the relationship between community and police in New York City in all of our neighborhoods. As Commissioner Bratton has said repeatedly: our police must be compassionate, constitutional and respectful in all we do. The NYPD is the most effective police force in this nation and is at its best and at its most effective when it has the support and respect of those that it protects. That is what we are working for every day. In light of yesterday's events, now more than ever we must come together as New Yorkers. As we search for answers and come to terms with this tragedy, let us keep </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his family in our hearts. With that, let me call upon Commissioner Bratton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Bill Bratton, NYPD: Good afternoon. On Thursday July 17th, two New York City police officers assigned to the 120th precinct on Staten Island and assigned to the Plainclothes Anti-Crime Unit, were directed by a superior officer to address specific conditions in the vicinity of Tompkinsville Park near the intersection of Victory Boulevard and Bay Street in Staten Island. It's a little triangular park in a very small commercial area almost directly across from the Staten Island Ferry terminal. The immediate area had been the subject of numerous community complaints by local residents and merchants. Year to date at that location there have been 98 arrests for various offenses, 100 cease summonses issued mostly for quality of life offenses, as well as 646 nine-eleven calls for service within the immediate area of that very small park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 3:30 pm the officers approached a 43 year old male, later identified as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, of 50 Vaughn Street, Staten Island, concerning the sale of illegal cigarettes in front of 202 Bay Street, Staten Island, directly across from the park. In attempting to take Mr. Garner into custody, there was a physical struggle during which Mr. Garner repeatedly complained of difficulty breathing as the officers wrestled him to the ground. An ambulance was immediately called to the scene and Mr. Garner was transported by EMS to Richmond University Medical Center. He went into cardiac arrest, if I understand, while he was in the vehicle. He was pronounced dead approximately one hour later at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical examiner will rule on the cause of death. The Richmond County District Attorney's office is leading the investigation--the criminal investigation--into this matter, assisted by the New York City Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau. And this morning I had the opportunity to go to Staten Island, visited the location of the incident. Met at length with the District Attorney and his staff. I also met with the commanding officer of the Staten Island borough police division, Ed Delatorre. I met with the City Council member who represents that area, Debi Rose, as well as James Oddo, the borough president. I also had conversations with the inspector general--or the newly named inspector general--for the City of New York to brief him on the circumstances of the case. So those are in fact the circumstances as we now know them. As the mayor has indicated, he has directed that there be a full, thorough, transparent investigation and myself and the district attorney are in fact committed to doing just that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: Thank you. I'm going to take questions just on this topic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question:  Commissioner, has the dropped status of the officers involved been changed at all, modified, or suspended, and could you tell us about their work history?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Bratton: The two officers who were engaged in the arrest of the deceased, one is an 8-year veteran, the other is a 4-year veteran. Both officers have been assigned to desk duty pending the investigation going forward, and until its conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Commissioner, why do chokeholds remain a persistent problem 20 years after you [inaudible]?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Bratton: The issue of chokeholds has been one that the Department began to address back as early as the 1980s, and over years has refined its policies and procedures relative to it. As recently as last year, when another order was issued to the effect that chokeholds are in fact prohibited by the NYPD, as they are, in fact, by most police departments in the United States, because of the concerns of potential death arising from them. So I have instructed, and you see with us Deputy Commissioner of Training Ben Tucker, to review the video but also to review all of our policies and to move forward, if necessary, with a reminder, retraining if appropriate, but at the minimum a reminder of the department's policies as it relates to the use of a chokehold which is in fact prohibited by the department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Do you view their usage as still a widespread problem?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Bratton: We do not. No. This is my first exposure to it in the six months I've been Police Commissioner and my seven years at the Los Angeles Police Department, which was a frequent user of that policy prior to 2002, that it was a relatively infrequent occurrence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Was this a chokehold, Commissioner Bratton? You've seen the video, I assume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Bratton: Yes, as defined in the department's patrol guide, this would appear to have been a chokehold. But the investigation, both by the District Attorney's office as well as by our Internal Affairs, will seek to make that final determination as part of our investigation. For purposes of the department, it would be an issue of if it's a violation of our policies and procedures. As to whether in any way shape or form a violation of law, that would be a determination of the District Attorney's criminal investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Selling cigarettes is not a violent crime or anything, yet pretty strong reaction from the officers, the back and forth according to the video, I wanted to get your thoughts on that aspect. And to the Mayor, a lot of people were looking to you to reform the NYPD, to change things, and what would you say to them today?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Bratton: The issue of the sale of individual cigarettes, &quot;loosies&quot; as they're called, which is apparently the action that the officers were asked to address at this location, while seemingly a small, maybe innocuous matter to most people, that quite obviously to the shop owners in that area who lost sales of cigarettes that in fact has tax stamps to this illegal type of activity, it was a concern to them, because they repeatedly called to ask the police to do something about this violation of the law. And it was for that reason that the officers were in fact directed to that location. So again, a seemingly minor quality of life offense, if you will, but it's one that the New York City Police Department is asked to address every day, because in fact it is complained about, it is the subject of 911 calls, and it is of concern to the quality of life as well as the business vitality in some of these neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: To the other part of your question, Commissioner Bratton and I are moving very consistently and energetically to create a series of reforms. And I think we can say, having spoken to community leaders all over the city, that the effect of those reforms is being felt on the ground. This incident was a tragedy. There will be a very thorough investigation. But if you look at what's happening all over the city, I think we can safely say that real progress is being made, that the relationship between police and community is starting to heal and improve. And it's something we are committed to for the long haul. Marcia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Mayor, [inaudible] you could tell me what your thoughts were after you saw the video? And Commissioner, if you could also tell me what your thoughts were [inaudible]?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: It was very troubling. I watched it the same way a family member would watch it, and it was very sad to watch. But that being said, we can't pass ultimate judgment based on one video. We need the facts of a full and detailed investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Bratton: I think we all, all of us, unequivocally understand that this was a tragedy. The loss of a life is always a tragedy - a tragedy for all involved. Certainly, Mr. Garner, his family, community, for the members of the New York City Police Department. Nobody began the day with the expectation it would end as it did. And so it is a tragedy that needs to be addressed, it needs to be thoroughly investigated, reviewed, and questions answered, and that is what we're committed to doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: [inaudible] still looking at the video, it's still under investigation. But circling back to what this initial call was about - the sale of illegal cigarettes. Would such a crime - alleged crime - warrant such an aggressive physical response?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: I'll start and pass it to the Commissioner. Look, if police officers are asked to enforce the law because there's a community concern, we require that - we expect that of them. We wouldn't want a situation where community members call with a concern and the police did not respond. The question of how you respond is a different matter. And I have real confidence that there's going to be, again, a very full and thorough investigation. I also have confidence - and I think the way the Commissioner framed it is exactly right - that if we have to go back and retrain people in what's appropriate, we're ready to do that, to make sure that members of the police force of course do enforce the law regularly and consistently, but do it in the right way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Bratton: Part of our investigation will be - despite the video that appears to show all that occurred - to understand all the circumstances surrounding it. The video made it quite apparent that the officers made it known to the deceased that they were intending to arrest him. He made it quite known to them that he was not going to allow that arrest to occur. I do not expect my officers to walk away from that type of situation. So in terms of our investigation going forward, it will be, as the mayor indicated, to determine were all the actions appropriate that led to this unfortunate circumstance and tragedy. But let's be quite clear that one of the things the video appears to show is that the officers were in fact in the performance of their lawful duties. They were there for that purpose, and in the course of that event, that they met resistance. Now the investigation will determine - was the actions that they took appropriate to the resistance that they were experiencing. Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor: Thank you everyone</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Emergency Medical Services has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four emergency workers involved in the medical response for a New York City man who died in police custody after being put in an apparent chokehold have been placed on &quot;modified duty&quot; and barred from responding to 911 calls, the Fire Department of New York said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two EMTs and two paramedics removed from the city's emergency response system are the latest public safety workers to face reassignment as questions mount about Thursday's death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Two police officers -- including the one who put his arm around Garner's neck -- have been put on desk duty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medics' modified duty restrictions will remain in effect pending an investigation into their actions, fire department spokesman James Long said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video of the arrest shot by a bystander shows one officer wrap his arm around Garner's neck as he is taken to the ground -- arrested for allegedly selling untaxed, loose cigarettes -- while Garner shouts, &quot;I can't breathe!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fire department disclosed the medics' reassignment after a second video surfaced showing at least a half-dozen police officers and emergency workers circling a man who appears to be Garner lying on the sidewalk, handcuffed and unresponsive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long said placing the emergency workers on modified duty -- which includes a notice in their state health department file that they are not to respond to medical calls -- is department protocol when questions arise about a medical response and was not a reaction to the post-arrest video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fire department said the emergency workers are employees of Richmond County Medical Center, the Staten Island hospital where Garner was taken by ambulance and pronounced dead. Authorities said the father of six likely had a heart attack, but more tests are needed to determine the exact cause and manner of his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Richmond County Medical Center spokeswoman did not immediately respond to messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long said the fire department took action against the hospital's emergency responders because it oversees the city's 911 system, a patchwork of public and privately-operated emergency services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restrictions on the medical personnel came a day after the police department said it reassigned Officer Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who used the apparent chokehold on Garner, and another unidentified officer while prosecutors and internal affairs detectives investigate. Chokeholds are banned under department policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department said it stripped Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran of the force, of his gun and badge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Court records show that within the past two years, three men sued Pantaleo in federal court over allegedly unlawful, racially motivated arrests. Pantaleo did not return a telephone message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Sunday, the Rev. Al Sharpton demanded justice for Garner and accountability from citizens who attack police officers during an appeal from the pulpit at Manhattan's Riverside Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner was &quot;choked by New York City policemen,&quot; the Harlem preacher told the congregation. &quot;What bothers me is that the nation watches a man say 'I can't breathe' and the choking continues, and police surround him and none of them even say, 'Wait a minute, stop! He can't breathe!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's funeral is scheduled for Wednesday at the Bethel Baptist Church in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video of Garner's struggle with police obtained by the New York Daily News shows the 6-foot-3, 350-pound man becoming irate and refusing to be handcuffed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, who has been arrested for illegally selling cigarettes numerous times in recent years, told the officers who confronted him that he had not done anything wrong, according to the video of the arrest.<BR>CLICK HERE FOR MORE INFORMATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time you see me, you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today,&quot; Garner shouts. &quot;I'm minding my business. Please just leave me alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, as four officers bring him down to the sidewalk, Garner, who was asthmatic, gasps, &quot;I can't breathe! I can't breathe!&quot; The video shows one officer using his hands to push Garner's face into the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- Four emergency responders have been put on modified duty while authorities investigate their response to a man, suspected of selling untaxed cigarettes, who died after New York police put him in a chokehold, a fire department official said on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians will not be permitted to respond to 911 calls while the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who was 43, is investigated, the fire department official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not a department spokesman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's death, the cause of which is still being determined by the city's medical examiner, has provoked outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill de Blasio, who promised to improve frayed relations between police and the public when he took office in January, called the death a &quot;terrible tragedy&quot; and promised a &quot;thorough&quot; investigation by the Staten Island district attorney and the police department's internal affairs bureau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four suspended emergency workers are not employees of the fire department but work for a Staten Island hospital, the fire department official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois legalizes medical marijuana for children with seizures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois children and adults with epilepsy will soon be allowed to use marijuana to ease their symptoms under a law signed on Sunday by Democratic Governor Pat Quinn, the latest in a series of measures loosening restrictions on cannabis by U.S. states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move to add epilepsy and other seizure disorders to the list of conditions legal to treat with marijuana or its extracts comes as numerous states have made medical use of the drug legal. Two states, Colorado and Washington, have legalized its recreational use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This new law will help alleviate the suffering of many adults and children across the state,&quot; Quinn said in statement. &quot;Epilepsy is a debilitating condition, and this much-needed relief will help to reduce some of its symptoms for those who endure seizures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois law, which takes effect in January, would allow children who experience seizures to be treated with non-smokable forms of cannabis, as long as they have permission from a parent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two police officers involved have also been put on desk duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamas says Israeli soldier captured; Gaza death toll jumps</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">JERUSALEM -- Hamas's armed wing said on Sunday it had captured an Israeli soldier, as fighting in Gaza led to the bloodiest losses in a nearly two-week military offensive, with some 100 Palestinians and 13 Israeli soldiers killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Israeli military said it was checking on the reported capture, which was announced in a Hamas television broadcast. Israeli television stations ignored the report in their extended evening programming about the offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Qassam Brigades captured a Zionist soldier,&quot; said Abu Ubaida, the masked spokesman of the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, who identified the soldier as Shaul Aron and recited what he said was Aron's identity tag number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">He provided no other evidence the soldier was in the custody of the Islamist militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ubaida said the capture happened during the same battle in which 13 Israeli soldiers died earlier, near Shejaia, the embattled neighborhood east of the city of Gaza where most of the Palestinian casualties occurred on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-day death toll was the highest for the Israeli military's since a 2006 war against Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon. It also represented the most Palestinians killed since fighting began on July 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aron would be the first Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza since 2011, when Israel released about 1,000 Palestinian prisoners to free Gilad Shalit, a soldier who was held for more than five years after his 2006 capture in a cross-border raid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cries of celebration and fireworks were heard around Gaza shortly after the Hamas broadcast on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas accused Israel of carrying out a massacre in Shejaia and declared three days of mourning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel's army said it had been targeting militants from Gaza's dominant Hamas group, whom it alleged had fired rockets from Shejaia and built tunnels and command centers there. The army said it had warned locals two days earlier to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Army sources said seven of the 13 Israeli soldiers were in an armored personnel carrier hit by anti-tank fire. Others were killed setting up positions inside houses they had taken over, the sources added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAKE GEORGE (AP) - Archaeologists are excavating an 18th-century battleground that was the site of a desperate stand by Colonial American troops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a confusing and complicated site,&quot; said David Starbuck, the archaeologist who is leading the project during the State University of New York at Adirondack's annual six-week archaeology field school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the site of the Battle of Lake George, fought Sept. 8, 1755, between British Colonial troops and their Mohawk allies and a force of French and Indians. Starbuck said he hopes to uncover evidence of the 1755 battle and the so-called entrenched camp that played a role in the siege and massacre that inspired James Fenimore Cooper's &quot;The Last of the Mohicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Revolutionary War, the same grounds were believed to have been the site of a smallpox hospital.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - A New York City police officer involved in the arrest of a man who died in custody after being placed in an apparent chokehold has been stripped of his gun and badge and placed on desk duty, police said Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Daniel Pantaleo, an eight-year NYPD veteran, and an officer who has been with the force for four years were both taken off the street after the death Thursday of 43-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Staten Island, police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department would not identify the second officer but said he would retain his gun and badge while on desk duty. The reassignment is effective immediately and will remain in effect while Garner's death is being investigated, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the city's largest police union, called Pantaleo's reassignment a &quot;completely unwarranted, knee-jerk reaction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision, Patrick Lynch said in a statement, &quot;effectively pre-judges&quot; the case and denies Pantaleo the &quot;very benefit of a doubt that has long been part of the social contract that allows police officers to face the risks of this difficult and complex job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo did not immediately return a telephone message seeking comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Partial video of the encounter obtained by the New York Daily News shows the 6-foot-3, 350-pound Garner becoming irate and refusing to be handcuffed as officers tried to arrest him on suspicion of selling untaxed, loose cigarettes on a sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video then shows one of the officers placing Garner in what Police Commissioner William Bratton said Friday appeared to be a chokehold. The tactic, which can be fatal, is prohibited by departmental policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department disclosed Pantaleo's reassignment hours after Garner's wife, Esaw, burst into tears at a Harlem rally where Rev. Al Sharpton said his death could strain the black community's relationship with the police department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is going to be a real test to see where policies are in the city now and whether the change that we feel occurred has occurred,&quot; Sharpton said, referring to promises made by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Bratton to improve the relationship between officers and the city's minority communities. &quot;We are the only ones in the social setup that has to deal with fear of cops and robbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another rally was held Saturday afternoon on Staten Island, near where Garner died. A funeral is scheduled for Wednesday at the Bethel Baptist Church in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the video of the arrest, Garner, who has been arrested for selling illegal cigarettes numerous times in recent years, says he hasn't done anything wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time you see me, you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today,&quot; Garner shouts. &quot;I'm minding my business. Please just leave me alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As four officers bring him down, Garner is heard gasping, &quot;I can't breathe! I can't breathe!&quot; The video shows one officer using his hands to push Garner's face into the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors and internal affairs detectives are investigating the death of the father of six and grandfather of two; authorities believe he suffered a heart attack. De Blasio has called the circumstances of his death &quot;very troubling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More tests are needed to determine the exact cause and manner of Garner's death, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor's commissioner for community affairs attended the rally and stressed the administration's commitment to strengthening police and community relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've said from the beginning: Police work best when they have the respect from the community,&quot; Marco Carrion said, adding that it's an ongoing process to try to improve the relationship between the NYPD and various communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's death evoked memories of a similar incident 20 years ago that likewise sparked outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officer Francis Livoti was dismissed from the NYPD and convicted by a federal jury of violating the civil rights of a Bronx man who died after Livoti apparently used a chokehold on him in 1994. Livoti has denied he used a chokehold, insisting Anthony Baez died from an asthma attack. The case remains one of the most high-profile allegations of police brutality in city history.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city agency that investigates allegations of police misconduct is studying the more than 1,000 complaints it has received in recent years about police officers using chokeholds, the agency said on Saturday, two days after a man died following a police encounter in which the hold appeared to be used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study by the Civilian Complaint Review Board follows an announcement on Friday by Police Commissioner William J. Bratton, who said a plainclothes officer on Staten Island appeared to have used a chokehold on Thursday in trying to arrest the man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department's patrol guide prohibits chokeholds, which it defines as including ''any pressure to the throat or windpipe, which may prevent or hinder breathing or reduce intake of air.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The encounter was filmed by a bystander and viewed widely on the Internet. The recording shows Mr. Garner, who had health problems including severe asthma, arguing with officers who had accused him of illegally selling cigarettes on a sidewalk on Staten Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garner, 43, a father of six, was a former employee of the city parks department; his mother, Gwen Carr, is a train operator with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority; and a sister, Ellisha Flagg, is an M.T.A. bus driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In trying to subdue Mr. Garner, the recording shows, an officer threw an arm around his neck as the officer struggled to pull the much-bigger Mr. Garner to the ground. Later, the officer continued to hold Mr. Garner around the neck for several seconds as he tried to crawl forward and other officers sought to put handcuffs on him. Mr. Garner could be heard saying, ''I can't breathe,'' over and over again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials identified the officer on Saturday as Daniel Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran who was assigned to a plainclothes team of officers in the 120th Precinct, which covers the northern tip of Staten Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Pantaleo was taken off the streets following the episode and given desk duty, but the Police Department formally asked for his gun and shield on Saturday, officially placing him on modified duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which is representing Officer Pantaleo, criticized the department for the restrictions, saying that the move ''under these circumstances is a completely unwarranted, knee-jerk reaction for political reasons and nothing more.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, ''It is a decision by the department that effectively prejudges this case and denies the officer the very benefit of a doubt that has long been part of the social contract that allows police officers to face the risks of this difficult and complex job.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Pantaleo has not spoken publicly about the episode, which is being investigated by the Staten Island district attorney's office and the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau. On Saturday afternoon, there was no answer at the brick house where Officer Pantaleo lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has not been determined whether the chokehold contributed to Mr. Garner's death. The city's medical examiner's office conducted an autopsy on Friday, but has not released any results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''At this time, no determination has been made by the Medical Examiner's office as to the cause and manner of death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office, Julie Bolcer, said in a statement, adding that further studies were still pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the recording of the encounter has raised new questions about police training and tactics more than 20 years after the Police Department banned chokeholds entirely from use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing the study, Richard Emery, the chairman of the complaint review board, said the agency was ''in the unique position of being able to look at the chokehold complaints it has received to attempt to discern why officers continue to use this forbidden practice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board said that it had received complaints about 1,022 instances, since 2009, in which the police were accused of using chokeholds, but that in only nine instances had the board discovered enough evidence to determine that a chokehold had been used. In hundreds of other cases, not enough evidence was available to make a determination, the board said, or the investigations stalled when the person making the complaint could not be found or refused to cooperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Pantaleo has been sued for civil rights violations twice in federal court since 2013. A plaintiff in one case, Tommy Rice, 41, said several officers -- his legal papers identify one as Officer Pantaleo -- pulled him and several friends over for a broken taillight before strip-searching them on the side of the road. Mr. Rice said they were arrested on charges, later dismissed, of using a vehicle to purchase narcotics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday afternoon, Mr. Garner's relatives appeared at a packed rally at a Staten Island church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He didn't die because he stopped breathing on his own, somebody took his breath away,'' Ms. Flagg, his sister, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was particularly troubled that the encounter began over accusations that Mr. Garner was illegally selling cigarettes. (In New York City, there is a thriving black market for cigarettes from states with lower tax rates).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''A cigarette, are you serious?'' she said. The people in the church, along with around 100 more who gathered outside, marched a mile to the spot where Mr. Garner died. The crowd shouted, ''No justice, no peace!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garner's funeral will be held on Wednesday in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A fly on the wall would have heard a frantic debate among Mayor de Blasio's inner circle about his planned trip to Italy. The decision to put it off for a day reflected a belated, if still incomplete, grasp of the complexities, including the optics.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To wit, it wouldn't look good for a progressive mayor to be pictured on a European vacation while the city boiled over.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The death of a Staten Island man in police custody sparked the delay, but any number of events could have qualified. While there is never a perfect time for a mayor to go away for 10 days, some are decidedly better than others. Six months into the job, during a summer shooting surge, is one of the worst.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police case makes the point. Two of the cops who arrested </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who is black, and put him in a chokehold were put on desk duty while the DA and the NYPD investigate. The incident was captured on video by a witness, and the mayor rightly called Garner's death a &quot;tragedy.&quot; Although he and Police Commissioner William Bratton suggested the cops were wrong, they wisely stopped short of declaring them guilty.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cops, like everybody else in America, are presumed innocent, as former Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Mike Bloomberg frequently reminded New Yorkers. It's more than a legal point. Cops make split-second decisions of life and death, and too much second-guessing can make them timid.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, de Blasio ran on an anti-police agenda, and that raises another question about the vacation: If the Garner case, or one like it, happened while he was away, would he rush home to deal with it?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The correct answer is yes, which is why he shouldn't have gone.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The forbidden chokehold used by a cop to take down a Staten Island man in a deadly encounter did not damage his windpipe or neck bones, sources said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The preliminary autopsy findings could be welcome news for Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo, now named as the cop who wrapped his arm around </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> throat while trying to &shy;arrest him Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;If you're the defense counsel in this case, this is very good news, because it's consistent with what appears to be the case - that they didn't mean to hurt him,&quot; said John Jay College Professor Eugene O'Donnell.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a source close to the ME investigation said coroners are also investigating whether the chokehold still caused Garner's death by aggravating his pre-existing conditions of obesity, asthma, and possible heart disease. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;If an obese person with co-existing medical problems can't get good oxygenation to begin with, then a chokehold could put him over the edge,&quot; and lead to a homicide finding, the source said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pantaleo has been placed on modified duty, his shield and gun taken. Saturday, cops gath&shy;ered evidence at his Staten Island home, leaving with a long, narrow box and three bags. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The eight-year NYPD veteran, along with Police Officer Justin Damico, a four-year vet, had been on patrol for &quot;conditions&quot; such as drug use, public intoxication and illegal cigarette sales at about 5 p.m. Thursday when they spotted the 6-foot-5, 350-pound Garner at his usual perch at Bay Street and Victory Boulevard in Tompkinsville. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The cops saw him sell a &quot;loosie&quot; to a man in a red shirt, law-enforcement sources said. Garner was known to hawk untaxed cigarettes for 50 cents apiece, and had eight &shy;arrests for the offense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Witnesses claimed Garner had done nothing but break up a fight prior to the officers arriving.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The guy got punched in the back, and [Garner] jumped up to break it up,&quot; said Ramsey Orta, 22. &quot;I know he didn't sell a cigarette because the guy in the red shirt, who got punched, asked me for a cigarette.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the videotaped confrontation, Garner is heard hollering at the two cops, &quot;Every time you see me, you try to mess with me. I'm tired of it. This ends today.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the cops move in, Garner protests, &quot;Please don't touch me.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The plainclothes, 5-foot- 10 Pantaleo then steps behind Garner, wraps his arm around his neck and pulls him to the sidewalk. As other cops join the scrum, Pantaleo is seen pushing the suspect's head against the sidewalk as Garner repeatedly gasps, &quot;I can't breathe! I can't breathe!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner, an asthmatic who had a long rap sheet of more than 30 petty crimes, along with three open cigarette-sales cases, died of cardiac arrest en route to a hospital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NYPD protocol prohibits the use of chokeholds.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even without damage to the throat, &quot;the chokehold alone is pretty damning,&quot; said civil rights lawyer Ronald Kuby. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Patrick Lynch, head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, urged New Yorkers to &quot;[give] our police the benefit of the doubt when a tragedy occurs in the performance of their duty.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The department's modification of this police officer under these circumstances is a completely unwarranted, kneejerk reaction for political reasons and nothing more,&quot; Lynch added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The death prompted 250 people to rally on Staten Island Saturday, as Garner's outraged family marched with the Rev. Al Sharpton and several politicians from a community center to the 120th Precinct station house. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;A cigarette, really? A cigarette? Are you serious?&quot; Garner's sister, Ellisha Flagg, told the crowd.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Many people who own stores sell illegal cigarettes. They lose their &shy;license, not their lives.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, said, &quot;They shouldn't have did this to my son. My son never [hurt] a soul. Never.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of the marchers chanted &quot;NYPD KKK.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The family took a condolence call from Mayor Bill de Blasio, who delayed an Italian vacation by a day because of the incident.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He &quot;reassured the family that the city is doing everything possible to ensure a full and thorough investigation,&quot; said spokeswoman Marti Adams. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allies of Bill de Blasio said yesterday that a man's death after an officer used a banned chokehold would show whether the mayor can deliver on campaign rhetoric to change the NYPD. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police department is under fire after an amateur video showed officers attempting to arrest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, of Staten Island on Thursday on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio, who rode to electoral victory on a wave of deep dissatisfaction in black and Latino communities about their treatment by police, called the video &quot;very troubling.&quot; It shows an officer coming from behind to put Garner in a chokehold banned years ago by the NYPD, and Garner's head being slammed to the pavement. He is heard repeatedly whimpering, &quot;I can't breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner was adamant that he did not want to be arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you. This is going to be a real test to see where policies are in the city now, and whether the change that we feel has occurred, has occurred,&quot; said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who led rallies yesterday at his Harlem headquarters and on Staten Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Public Advocate Letitia James: &quot;This case will test our mettle as a city - and as progressives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio, who postponed his family vacation to Italy one day to deal with the uproar, spoke by telephone with Garner's widow, Esaw Garner, and mother, Gwen Carr, yesterday, said mayoral spokeswoman Marti Adams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He reassured the family that the city is doing everything possible to ensure a full and thorough investigation,&quot; Adams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The issue is not whether one was selling cigarettes,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;The issue was how an unarmed man was subjected to a chokehold and the result is he is no longer with us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Sharpton spoke, Esaw Garner's knees buckled and he helped support her. She and Carr, also visibly distraught, had to be led away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's funeral is to be held at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Bethel Baptist Church, on Bergen Street in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio and NYPD Commissioner William Bratton said that a final determination of any breaking of the law would come after an investigation by the Staten Island district attorney. But yesterday, Sharpton suggested that undue influence by the police union could undermine an inquiry. &quot;I have very serious questions,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglas Auer, a spokesman, sent a statement from District Attorney Daniel Donovan: &quot;My office is working along with the NYPD to do a complete and thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Garner's death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD yesterday identified Daniel Pantaleo as the officer who put Garner in the chokehold and said he had been placed on desk duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association blasted the move as &quot;a completely unwarranted, knee-jerk reaction for political reasons and nothing more.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Daniel Pantaleo, an eight-year NYPD veteran, and an officer who has been with the force for four years were both taken off the street after the death Thursday of 43-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Staten Island, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department would not identify the second officer but said he would retain his gun and badge while on desk duty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is going to be a real test to see where policies are in the city now and whether the change that we feel occurred has occurred,&quot; Sharpton said, referring to promises made by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Bratton to improve the relationship between officers and the city's minority communities. &quot;We are the only ones in the social setup that has to deal with fear of cops and robbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COURT OKS STAY IN UTAH GAY MARRIAGE CASE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday granted Utah's request for a stay in an appellate court ruling, allowing the state to avoid - at least for now - having to recognize about 1,300 same-sex marriages performed after its ban on such unions was struck down late last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In December, U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby ruled in a lawsuit that Utah's ban was unconstitutional. Shelby did not put a stay in place, but Utah requested a stay from Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, which she granted on Jan. 6. During that 17-day period, many same-sex couples wed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that stay, pending an appeal to the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The couples who wed in that interim period would have been able to file for state benefits Monday morning had the Supreme Court not granted the stay. The stay was granted without dissent or opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Utah attorney general's office said it was preparing an appeal to file later in the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 DEAD IN LAKE PLACID PLANE CRASH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NORTH ELBA, N.Y. - A small plane crashed Saturday while attempting to land at an airport near Lake Placid, killing all three people on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State police said the plane, a single-engine Mooney M20 registered in West Virginia, burst into flames on impact around 10:40 a.m. Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lake Placid Municipal Airport manager Steve Short said preliminary information showed the plane crashed after its first attempt at landing was thwarted by a plane approaching from the opposite direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Per protocol, both planes turned away from each other to circle and attempt the landing again, Short said. He said the pilot of the Mooney deployed the plane's flaps but never retracted them before making the second approach, inhibiting its ability to fully circle and attempt another landing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plane lost power and crashed on a farm about two-thirds of a mile from the runway, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD -- Islamist insurgents have issued an ultimatum to northern Iraq's dwindling Christian population to convert to Islam, pay a religious levy or face death, according to a statement distributed in the militant-controlled city of Mosul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement issued by the Islamic State, the al-Qaida offshoot that led last month's lightning assault to capture swaths of north Iraq, said the ruling would go into effect Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said Christians who wanted to remain in the caliphate that the Islamic State declared this month in parts of Iraq and Syria must agree to abide by terms of a dhimma contract -- a historic practice under which non-Muslims were protected in Muslim lands in return for a special levy known as jizya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We offer them three choices: Islam; the dhimma contract, involving payment of jizya; if they refuse this they will have nothing but the sword,&quot; the announcement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A resident of Mosul said the statement, issued in the name of the Islamic State in Iraq's northern province of Nineveh, had been distributed Thursday and read in mosques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi set a Saturday deadline for Christians who did not want to stay and live under those terms to &quot;leave the borders of the Islamic Caliphate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mosul, once home to diverse faiths, had a Christian population of about 100,000 a decade ago, but waves of attacks on Christians since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein have seen those numbers collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington wildfires force evacuation of small town</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A wildfire burning out of control in Washington state's Cascade Mountains destroyed at least 35 homes and forced the evacuation of an entire town early Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four separate fires triggered by lightning merged into two Thursday, quickly scorching 15 miles of land and sending flames encroaching on the central Washington town of Pateros, some 120 miles northeast of Seattle, local emergency officials said. Mandatory evacuations were issued for the community's nearly 800 residents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- A supertyphoon slammed into China on Friday killing one person, as the government ordered an all-out effort to prevent loss of life from a storm that has already killed at least 64 people in the Philippines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OKLAHOMA CITY -- An appeals court Friday upheld a lower court decision voiding as unconstitutional Oklahoma's ban on same-sex marriage, drawing on a similar decision it made for Utah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision by the three-judge panel of the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest in a series of rulings by judges in federal and state courts to find that such exclusions violate the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAIDUGURI, Nigeria -- Boko Haram gunmen killed many villagers and set homes ablaze in a northeastern Nigerian town just 53 miles from the strategic center of Maiduguri before dawn Friday, according to survivors. Well-armed Islamic extremists attacked Damboa as residents were preparing for the 5 a.m. dawn prayers and the civilian defense fighters could only resist with clubs and homemade shotguns.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MILAN -- The number of executions worldwide rose last year despite a general global trend toward capital punishment abolition, according to a report released Friday by an Italian anti-death penalty group. The organization Hands off Cain, based in Rome, said Friday that at least 4,106 people were executed in 2013, up from 3,967 in 2012.</SPAN></P>

His daughter wanted the body autopsied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- A New York City man died during an arrest -- partially captured on amateur video -- during which a police officer placed him in what appeared be a choke hold as several others brought him to the ground and struggled to place him in handcuffs. Internal affairs investigators and prosecutors opened inquiries into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thursday evening death outside a Staten Island beauty salon. Garner, 43, had a heart attack as he struggled with officers trying to arrest him on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes, police said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOUSTON -- A Texas-based group involved in searches for missing persons around the nation said it will resume using drones in its work after a federal appeals court ruled on Friday that a warning the group received to stop using them didn't have any legal consequences. Texas EquuSearch had sued the Federal Aviation Administration, seeking to overturn what the group described as an order it had been sent in February by email prohibiting the nonprofit organization from using drones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gay marriage licenses halted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER -- Colorado's Supreme Court on Friday ordered the Denver County clerk to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples while the state's ban against the unions remains in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denver Clerk &amp; Recorder Debra Johnson, one of three county clerks in Colorado who began issuing licenses to same-sex couples after a string of legal victories for gay marriage, responded on Twitter: &quot;Disappointed, but respect ruling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actor, Macy's settle suit:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- Rob Brown, a black actor who accused Macy's of racially profiling minorities as shoplifters, is settling his civil rights lawsuit, one of several cases that drew attention last year to long-simmering complaints about how big retailers treat minority customers. Macy's wouldn't discuss the terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">saying only that it values every customer and remains &quot;committed to ensuring that every individual who steps into our store feels welcome and appreciated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown appears on the HBO drama series &quot;Treme&quot; and has acted in films such as &quot;Coach Carter&quot; and &quot;Finding Forrester.&quot; He said he was falsely accused of credit card fraud at Macy's flagship store after buying a $1,300 watch for his mother for her college graduation in June 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was handcuffed, held for almost an hour in a store detention cell and grilled about the watch by men who mocked the idea that he could afford it, but he was then released without any charges, according to his court complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that I was profiled,&quot; Brown said last fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His lawsuit was among a series of complaints by black shoppers that spotlighted questions about security practices and profiling at Macy's and other major retailers in the city. Years earlier, Macy's had paid a $600,000 fine and promised changes after the state attorney general made similar claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new allegations against the store immortalized in &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; stirred outrage among civil rights advocates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Venezuelan tourist was accused of shoplifting at Macy's after she said she was just carrying items around the store, but she was acquitted. Her lawyer said she was detained for more than six hours as her 12-year-old son waited, not knowing where she was. In another case, prosecutors dropped charges against a Pakistani shopper who said she was unfairly profiled and falsely accused of stealing jewelry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December, Macy's and several other major retailers agreed to create and publicize a customer bill of rights that explicitly prohibits profiling and unreasonable searches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Macy's said in its statement that it also had reached agreements to settle other racial profiling lawsuits. At least eight shoppers have filed such suits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a New York man allegedly selling illegal &quot;loosies&quot; - single cigarettes - outside a Staten Island store, died Thursday after police used an unauthorized street fighting move known as a &quot;chokehold&quot; to subdue the 350-pound man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stark contrast between a minor street crime - one which Mr. Garner had been arrested for many times - and the tragic consequence of leaving a widow with six kids has forced New Yorkers to revisit some of the darker chapters for the city's elite but oft-chastised police force, and to rehash what many thought were long-settled issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Police commissioner William Bratton, chokeholds used by at least two police officers to subdue Garner came after the man pleaded with a gaggle of officers to leave him alone as he was &quot;minding his own business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time you see me, you want to mess with me,&quot; Garner can be heard saying. &quot;I'm tired of it. It stops today. I'm minding my business please just leave me alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The encounter escalated to the point of a faceoff, whereupon one officer wraps his arm around his neck even as Garner, now on the ground, pleads that he can't breathe. A few minutes later Garner loses consciousness as the officer mashed his face into the sidewalk - the victim of a fatal heart attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enough of the ordeal was captured by an amateur photographer's camera for Mayor Bill de Blasio to rule the death &quot;a terrible tragedy.&quot; A bigger question remained: Why did two veteran officers feel free to employ a tactic banned in 1993, especially given that a civil conversation may have deescalated the ordeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was all the way back in 1983 when the department, following several asphyxiation deaths, banned the practice except in cases of imminent danger to the police officer. In 1994, a year after the city banned the tactic altogether, NYPD Officer Francis Livoti killed Bronx resident Anthony Baez with a chokehold after Mr. Livoti's cruiser was hit by a football being thrown around by friends. Livoti was found not guilty of negligent homicide, but later served seven years in prison after a federal court found he violated Baez' civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chokeholds are prohibited by the New York City Police Department and most departments,&quot; Commissioner Bratton said at a news conference Friday. Mr. Bratton also noted that &quot;Mr. Garner repeatedly complained of difficulty breathing as the officers wrestled him to the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policing experts say that it's fine to ask officers to be more careful with aggressive subjects, but that once an incident escalates into a street fight that all bets are essentially off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hard truth about street policing is there's a tremendous amount of improvisation,&quot; Eugene O'Donnell, a former cop and now a criminologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice told the New York Daily News.&nbsp; &quot;[Officers] get some very generalized guidance, typically, which is not very valuable once you have to make the decision to use force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that at least two officers utilized it has been enough to spark an inquest and investigation into Garner's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton held a vigil for Garner amid calls for justice as the widow, Esaw Garner, clung to Sharpton in tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Police Department and mayors have fought for controversial tactics that focus on low-level crimes, arguing tactics like the controversial &quot;stop-and-frisks&quot; are not only constitutional but effective in curbing local crime rates. Some courts have disagreed with at least the first notion, forcing the city to largely abandon the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other major US police departments, including in Atlanta, are putting less emphasis on penny-ante arrests because of the wedge they tend to drive between tougher neighborhoods and the police officers that serve them.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 350-pound man, about to be arrested on charges of illegally selling cigarettes, was arguing with the police. When an officer tried to handcuff him, the man pulled free. The officer immediately threw his arm around the man's neck and pulled him to the ground, holding him in what appears, in a video, to be a chokehold. The man can be heard saying ''I can't breathe'' over and over again as other officers swarm about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the death of the man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, soon after the confrontation on Thursday on Staten Island, is being investigated by the police and prosecutors. At the center of the inquiry is the officer's use of a chokehold -- a dangerous maneuver that was banned by the New York Police Department more than 20 years ago but that the department cannot seem to be rid of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''As defined in the department's patrol guide, this would appear to have been a chokehold,'' the police commissioner, William J. Bratton, said at a news conference in City Hall on Friday afternoon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He referred to police rules that forbid chokeholds and define them as including ''any pressure to the throat or windpipe, which may prevent or hinder breathing or reduce intake of air.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent city agency that investigates allegations of police abuse, logged 233 allegations involving chokeholds in 2013, making up 4.4 percent of the excessive-force complaints it received. Although only a tiny fraction of the chokehold complaints that the agency receives are ever substantiated, the number of complaints has generally been rising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A decade ago, when the review board was receiving a comparable number of force complaints, chokehold allegations were less frequent. They made up 2.3 percent of the excessive-force complaints in 2003, and no more than 2.7 percent in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''My throat was on his forearm,'' one man who was arrested in Queens testified in April in an internal police disciplinary proceeding, describing how he ''could barely breathe'' after an officer allegedly placed him in a chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear if the chokehold contributed to the death on Thursday afternoon of Mr. Garner, who was at least 6 feet 3 inches tall and who, friends said, had several health issues: diabetes, sleep apnea, and asthma so severe that he had to quit his job as a horticulturist for the city's parks department. He wheezed when he talked and could not walk a block without resting, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the use of a chokehold in subduing a large but unarmed man during a low-level arrest raises for Mr. Bratton the same questions about police training and tactics that he faced 20 years ago, in his first stint as New York City's police commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, the year after the Police Department banned chokeholds, a man named Anthony Baez died in the Bronx after a police officer put him in a chokehold during a dispute over a touch football game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At City Hall on Friday, Mr. Bratton said he did not believe that the use of chokeholds by police officers in New York City was a widespread problem, saying this was his ''first exposure'' to the issue since returning as police commissioner in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill de Blasio, standing next to Mr. Bratton, said, ''Like so many New Yorkers I was very troubled by the video,'' referring to a bystander's recording of the incident, which was posted on the website of The New York Daily News. The two police officers who initially confronted Mr. Garner have been temporarily taken off patrol duty. The police declined to name the officers but said one of them had been on the force for eight years and the other for four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Friday, the mayor's office announced that Mr. de Blasio was postponing his family's departure on a planned vacation to Italy from Friday evening until Saturday. The postponement was to allow Mr. de Blasio to spend more time making calls to elected officials, community leaders and members of the clergy, and talking to the police, about Mr. Garner's death, the mayor's press secretary, Phil Walzak, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The encounter between Mr. Garner and plainclothes officers, from the 120th Precinct, began after the officers accused Mr. Garner of illegally selling cigarettes, an accusation he was familiar with. He had been arrested more than 30 times, often accused of selling loose cigarettes bought outside the state, a common hustle designed to avoid state and city tobacco taxes. In March and again in May, he was arrested on charges of illegally selling cigarettes on the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, Mr. Garner chafed at the scrutiny by the police, which he considered harassment. In 2007, he filed a handwritten complaint in federal court accusing a police officer of conducting a cavity search of him on the street, ''digging his fingers in my rectum in the middle of the street'' while people passed by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, Mr. Garner told lawyers at Legal Aid that he intended to take all the cases against him to trial. ''He was adamant he wouldn't plead guilty to anything,'' said Christopher Pisciotta, the lawyer in charge of the Staten Island office of Legal Aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite all the scrutiny from the police, most days Mr. Garner, a father of six, would stand on Bay Street, in the Tompkinsville neighborhood, his ankles visibly swollen, hawking loose Lucky cigarettes for 50 cents each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, when officers confronted him nearby and accused him of selling tobacco to a man in a red shirt, Mr. Garner reacted with exasperation, suggesting he was not going to cooperate. ''I'm tired of it,'' he said. ''This stops today.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I didn't do nothing,'' Mr. Garner tells an officer. ''Every time you see me, you want to harass me, you want to stop me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point he has his hands on his hips; at other points he is gesturing energetically. ''Please just leave me alone,'' he says. In the video, Mr. Garner can be seen crawling forward on the ground as an officer hangs on with his arm around Mr. Garner's neck. Other officers surround Mr. Garner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon, the officer releases his grip around Mr. Garner's neck and, kneeling, presses Mr. Garner's head into the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garner was pronounced dead a short time later at Richmond University Medical Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Pisciotta, the Legal Aid lawyer who knew Mr. Garner as a frequent client, said he was struck by how quickly the officers resorted to putting ''him into a chokehold,'' perhaps in reaction to Mr. Garner's formidable size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Pisciotta said that Mr. Garner, however imposing his appearance, was ''a gentle giant,'' who was known for breaking up fights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''To me it looks like they saw a mountain of a man and they decided to take him down using immediate and significant force,'' Mr. Pisciotta said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, a woman at Mr. Garner's home, who identified herself as a cousin named Stephanie, said: ''The family is very, very sad. We're in shock. Why did they have to grab him like that?''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Evoking memories of a more troubling era, the NYPD finds itself under mounting criticism over the death of a Staten Island man whom police were arresting for selling illegal cigarettes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Mayor de Blasio warned it's &quot;too early to jump to any conclusions&quot; about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a 400-pound asthmatic who suffered a fatal heart attack while resisting arrest.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mayor added he found a video showing the man in an apparent chokehold &quot;very troubling&quot; - and raised questions about how cops are to respond when called to enforce the law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Councilman Jumaane Williams called it a clear-cut case of cop brutality. Meanwhile, Al Sharpton plans to appear with Garner's relatives to demand an investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner's death is a tragedy. No one should die while being arrested. But it doesn't automatically make the NYPD culpable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Police Commissioner Bill Bratton noted, plainclothes cops - acting on repeated complaints from local merchants - told Garner they were going to arrest him. Garner, in turn, &quot;made it quite clear he would not allow himself to be arrested.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bratton added, &quot;I do not expect my officers to walk away&quot; in that kind of situation, especially when, as in Garner's case, they are physically resisted while &quot;in performance of their lawful duties.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We'll be watching to see what investigators conclude about the force police used.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Until all the facts are in, we share a view Ed Koch once expressed: Mayors are &quot;obliged&quot; to presume cops accused of brutality during an arrest have &quot;engaged in the lawful use of appropriate force, unless circumstances are clearly to the contrary.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayor de Blasio refused to change his Italy vacation plans for a potentially crippling LIRR strike - but suddenly delayed the trip Friday amid outcries for a full investigation into how a Staten Island man died after being arrested.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The mayor will postpone the departure for his upcoming family vacation to Saturday, in order to attend to city business,&quot; City Hall announced just a couple of hours before de Blasio's scheduled &shy;departure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Earlier in the week, when the strike was looming, the mayor argued there was no need to change his getaway plans because &quot;I can be in absolutely immediate touch with all the key figures in the administration whenever needed.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   One city official said de Blasio felt it was important to stay in the city Friday night to &quot;consult with community leaders&quot; about the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A City Hall insider said the mayor was also considering &shy;attending rallies sponsored by the Rev. Al Sharpton with Garner's family in Harlem and on Staten &shy;Island Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A plainclothes cop violated department protocol by using a choke hold while handcuffing Garner, who died in an ambulance immediately after the arrest, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That officer and another cop who arrested Garner were both placed on desk duty following Thursday's violent arrest, Bratton said at a City Hall press conference. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The Richmond County District Attorney's Office is leading the investigation - the criminal investigation - into this matter, assisted by the NYPD Internal &shy;Affairs Bureau,&quot; Bratton said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sources identified the two cops who initiated the arrest as Daniel Pantaleo and Justin Damico, but did not identify which one put Garner in a choke hold.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;There's a very high chance that the officer who put him in a choke hold would lose his job,&quot; said a law-enforcement source familiar with the investigation. &quot;It violates protocol. It violates a direct rule which is never to put somebody in a choke hold.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police said they forced the 350-pound Garner to the ground and piled atop him at 3:30 p.m. in Tompkinsville because he was selling &shy;untaxed cigarettes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But witnesses told The Post that Garner was not peddling smokes and had actually tried to break up a fight between two people who ran off before cops arrived. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner, a father of six and former parks worker, died of a heart attack in an &shy;ambulance, police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  De Blasio said video of the &shy;arrest was &quot;very troubling.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While de Blasio and his family are paying their own way to Italy, taxpayers will shell out about $13,000 for the three staffers joining the trip. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 43-year-old Staten Island man died Thursday after a police officer used a chokehold that was apparently not authorized by department regulations, NYPD Commissioner William Bratton said yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton spoke about the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Port Richmond, to whom the hold was applied as he was being subdued for resisting arrest. Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke at a news conference in City Hall yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor called the death &quot;a terrible tragedy.&quot; Soon after, a spokesman for the mayor said de Blasio was postponing his family vacation to Italy one day, until today, because &quot;he thought it was important to be here tonight [Friday] and consult with community leaders,&quot; according to an administration official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official did not identify which leaders the mayor planned to speak with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some residents who witnessed the arrest attempt, along with community leaders, said the incident was an example of police brutality and racism toward a victim who was black. They called for strong action by the mayor and police officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the news conference, Bratton said that the apparent unauthorized chokehold was used by one of two officers who were attempting to take Garner into custody after local merchants complained he was taking away their business by selling, at a small park across from the Staten Island Ferry terminal, &quot;loosies,&quot; single untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials have said Garner, who reportedly weighed 350 pounds and was more than 6 feet tall, has a lengthy history of arrests, including for the selling of untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civilian witnesses, who have spoken to the Staten Island Advance and other media, have reportedly said Garner was not selling untaxed cigarettes but was attempting to break up a fight between people who fled before police arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chokeholds are prohibited by the New York City Police Department and most departments,&quot; Bratton said at the news conference. The commissioner added that &quot;Mr. Garner repeatedly complained of difficulty breathing as the officers wrestled him to the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio and Bratton said that a final determination of any breaking of law or departmental regulations would be made after an investigation by the Staten Island district attorney's office and the police internal affairs unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton said the two officers involved - whom he identified as eight-year and four-year department veterans - have been placed on desk duty. With Matthew Chayes</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the first of two planned rallies after the death of a man in NYPD custody, Rev. Al Sharpton said Saturday the incident would pose a &quot;test&quot; for the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio - who is leaving for an Italian vacation tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is going to be a real test to see where policies are in the city now, and whether the change that we feel has occurred has occurred,&quot; Mr. Sharpton said at a rally at National Action Network headquarters in Harlem, which was also streamed live online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, died after police sought to arrest him for selling untaxed cigarettes in Staten Island Thursday. Video posted by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New York Daily News</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shows officers using a chokehold - prohibited by NYPD regulations - to bring Mr. Garner to the ground as he repeatedly shouts he cannot breath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. de Blasio was elected with strong support from black voters and has vowed to improve the NYPD's relationship with communities of color, in part by reducing the use of stop and frisk. He vowed Friday that there would be a &quot;thorough&quot; investigation into Mr. Garner's death, and called video of the&nbsp;arrest &quot;troubling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. de Blasio&nbsp; postponed his trip, which was slated to begin with a Friday night flight, and spoke with Mr. Garner's family by phone Saturday morning, spokeswoman Marti Adams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor de Blasio called Mr. Garner's wife and mother this morning to offer his condolences. During their conversation, he reassured the family that the city is doing everything possible to ensure a full and thorough investigation,&quot; she told the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Observer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor has no public events scheduled for Saturday, but has been calling community leaders, elected officials and NYPD officials about the situation, Ms. Adams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garner's family attended the morning rally in Harlem, where his wife at one point was overcome with grief, crumpling&nbsp;on the stage and leading Mr. Sharpton to call for a song so she could be escorted away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Council Public Safety Chairwoman Vanessa Gibson told the crowd she&nbsp;was &quot;full of emotions today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as easily as he lived in Staten Island, could've lived in my community in the Bronx - could have been my father, my brother, my uncle, so I take this personally,&quot; Ms. Gibson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also urged people to respond to Mr. Garner's death appropriately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot react in a negative way - we must take this energy, this emotion, and turn it into action,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sharpton is set to rally again with Mr. Garner's family, local and citywide leaders - including Comptroller Scott Stringer - at 2 p.m. in Staten Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">This post has been updated to include new information about Mr. de Blasio calling Mr. Garner's family.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama will sign an executive order on Monday barring federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, senior administration officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order will allow some exemptions for religious groups that are federal contractors but not as much flexibility as the groups had wanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A religious organization would be barred from making hiring decisions based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Exceptions would be allowed for ministers, and groups would be allowed to favor individuals of a particular religion when hiring. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials told reporters on Friday that Mr. Obama's action would update two previous orders about discrimination already on the books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EPA to block copper mine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - U.S. environmental regulators laid out proposed protections for Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed on Friday that would effectively block the development of the Pebble deposit, which could be one of the world's largest copper mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 214-page document posted to its website, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to restrict the use of certain waters in the region for disposal of dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the latest step by the EPA to use a rare process under the Clean Water Act to try to stop work on the proposed copper-gold mine, which it says would threaten the region's valuable salmon fisheries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project owner Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd, meanwhile, has sued the EPA for trying to derail development before the company has even applied for its permit or environmental assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okla. gay marriage ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OKLAHOMA CITY - A federal appeals court ruling Friday that Oklahoma's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional spurred celebration among gay rights activists but sparked sharp anger among Republican leaders in a conservative state that prides itself on being the buckle of the nation's Bible Belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision by a three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver upholding a federal judge's ruling is the latest in a decade-long legal battle. That fight was launched by two couples - Sharon Baldwin and Mary Bishop, and Gay Phillips and Susan Barton - shortly after 76 percent of Oklahoma voters backed the ban in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court put its 2-1 ruling on hold pending an appeal, meaning same-sex couples won't be allowed to marry in Oklahoma for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Man put in chokehold dies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - The New York Police Department has launched an internal investigation into the death of a 43-year-old man whose final moments were captured in a video in which he can be heard gasping &quot;I can't breathe&quot; over and over again after an officer is seen placing him in a chokehold, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, died Thursday afternoon as plainclothes officers tried to take him into custody on a Staten Island street on charges of selling cigarettes, according to an account the police have released. A video, posted on the website of The New York Daily News, shows an argument of mounting intensity as Mr. Garner quarrels with a plainclothes officer about whether he would be arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton papers released</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - President Bill Clinton asked advisers for more information on Osama bin Laden in 1998 after flagging a newspaper story, according to records from the Clinton White House that were released Friday. The records also detail consideration of military action in Haiti in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Archives released about 1,000 pages of previously restricted documents from Mr. Clinton's two terms, part of about 20,000 pages of Clinton records that have been disseminated since February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest batch also covers the Supreme Court nominations of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, the appellate court nomination of future Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, security planning for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and the 2000 presidential campaign of Al Gore, then the vice president.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOSTON - Joseph O'Donnell, 55, an unlicensed funeral director accused of stealing more than $12,000 from an elderly couple could face more charges after authorities found 12 bodies and the cremated remains of more than 40 others in two self-storage units he rented, authorities said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suffolk District Attorney Daniel Conley said no foul play is suspected in the deaths.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A NEW York City man died during an arrest - partially captured on amateur video - during which a police officer placed him in what appeared be a choke hold as several others brought him to the ground and struggled to place him in handcuffs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, died on Thursday evening outside a beauty salon in Staten Island after police apprehended him. Internal affairs investigators and prosecutors have begun enquiries. Garner, 43, had a heart attack as he struggled with officers trying to arrest him on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes, police said. An autopsy will take place on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Partial video of the confrontation obtained by the New York Daily News shows an officer placing what appears to be a choke hold on the 6ft 3in, 350-pound (1.9m, 159kg) Garner, who can be heard complaining repeatedly that he &quot;can't breathe&quot; as at least four other officers bring him down. He then apparently loses consciousness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video shows the officer who apparently choked Garner using his hands to push Garner's face into the sidewalk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a responsibility to keep every New Yorker safe, and that includes when individuals are in custody of the NYPD,&quot; Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement, expressing his condolences to Garner's family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramsey Orta, 22, shot the video posted by the newspaper. He said that he was sitting with Garner and discussing weekend plans before the confrontation with police. Garner had just broken up a fight between two other men when the police approached him. Officers claimed they'd observed him selling loose cigarettes, Orta said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before they even grabbed him, he told them he wasn't feeling good and that's why I pulled the camera out and started recording,&quot; said Orta, adding that Garner was asthmatic. &quot;They could've just hopped out on the guys who were fighting, but they didn't bother to ask. They just jumped straight on him.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner has been arrested 31 times since 1988 on charges such as drug possession, selling untaxed cigarettes and assault, police said. He was last arrested in May for selling untaxed cigarettes, court records show. Since 2009, he was arrested nine different times for selling such cigarettes, police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the video, a clearly irate Garner shouts that he hasn't done anything wrong. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time you see me, you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today,&quot; Garner shouts. &quot;I'm minding my business please just leave me alone.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick J. Lynch, president of the powerful Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, cautioned against drawing conclusions before the results of the official probe were released. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not wanting to be arrested does not grant an individual the right to resist arrest nor does it free the officers of the obligation to make the arrest,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National First Responders Organization has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -  The Rev. Al Sharpton has planned two separate rallies Saturday following the death of a New York City man who died during an arrest in which partial video of the struggle shows an officer placing him in what the police commissioner said appeared to be a choke hold -- a tactic prohibited by departmental policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill de Blasio, who called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thursday death &quot;very troubling,&quot; even postponed his much-discussed family vacation to Italy, aides said, in order to meet with community leaders and city officials throughout the night Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, 43, suffered a heart attack during a confrontation with police who were attempting to arrest him on suspicions of selling untaxed cigarettes outside a beauty parlor on Staten Island near the ferry terminal, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two plain-clothes officers confront the 6-foot-3-inch tall, 350-pound man who in turn becomes irate, denying the charges and refusing to be handcuffed when one of the officers places him in what appears to be the choke hold from behind, according video obtained by the New York Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner can be heard complaining repeatedly that he can't breathe as at least four other officers bring him down. He then apparently loses consciousness. The video shows the officer who apparently choked Garner using his hands to push Garner's face into the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I watched it the same way a family member would watch it, and it was very sad to watch,&quot; de Blasio said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staten Island prosecutors and detectives from the internal affairs division have opened probes, the mayor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More tests are needed to determine Garner's cause and manner of death, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty years ago, police officer Francis Livoti was dismissed from the NYPD and convicted by a federal jury for violating the civil rights of a Bronx man prosecutors said died after Livoti used a choke hold on him in 1994. Livoti has denied he used a choke hold, insisting Anthony Baez died form an asthma attack. But the case remained one of the most high-profile allegations of police brutality in city history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, at a makeshift vigil near the spot where Garner died, friends and neighbors gathered to pay their respects -- and to vent their anger over what they described as disrespectful and even abusive treatment by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need more courtesy and professional respect,&quot; said a friend, Jonathan DeGroat, standing near where someone had scrawled &quot;RIP Big E&quot; on the sidewalk. &quot;Justice needs to be served or there will never be peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramsey Orta, 22, who shot the video posted by the newspaper, told The Associated Press on Friday that Garner had just broken up a fight between two other men when the police approached him, claiming they'd observed him selling loose cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before they even grabbed him, he told them he wasn't feeling good and that's why I pulled the camera out and started recording,&quot; said Orta, adding that Garner was asthmatic.</SPAN></P>

He was last arrested in May for selling untaxed cigarettes, court records show. Since 2009, he was arrested nine different times for selling such cigarettes, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner William Bratton and the mayor have expressed their desire to improve the relationship between officers and the community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, 43, suffered a heart attack during a confrontation with police who were attempting to arrest him on suspicions of selling untaxed cigarettes outside a beauty parlor on Staten Island near the ferry terminal, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two plain-clothes officers confront the 6-foot-3-inch tall, 350-pound man who in turn becomes irate, denying the charges and refusing to be handcuffed when one of the officers places him in what appears to be the choke hold from behind, according video obtained by the New York Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner can be heard complaining repeatedly that he can't breathe as at least four other officers bring him down. He then apparently loses consciousness. The video shows the officer who apparently choked Garner using his hands to push Garner's face into the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I watched it the same way a family member would watch it, and it was very sad to watch,&quot; de Blasio said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staten Island prosecutors and detectives from the internal affairs division have opened probes, the mayor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More tests are needed to determine Garner's cause and manner of death, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty years ago, police officer Francis Livoti was dismissed from the NYPD and convicted by a federal jury for violating the civil rights of a Bronx man prosecutors said died after Livoti used a choke hold on him in 1994. Livoti has denied he used a choke hold, insisting Anthony Baez died form an asthma attack. But the case remained one of the most high-profile allegations of police brutality in city history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, at a makeshift vigil near the spot where Garner died, friends and neighbors gathered to pay their respects -- and to vent their anger over what they described as disrespectful and even abusive treatment by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need more courtesy and professional respect,&quot; said a friend, Jonathan DeGroat, standing near where someone had scrawled &quot;RIP Big E&quot; on the sidewalk. &quot;Justice needs to be served or there will never be peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramsey Orta, 22, who shot the video posted by the newspaper, told The Associated Press on Friday that Garner had just broken up a fight between two other men when the police approached him, claiming they'd observed him selling loose cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before they even grabbed him, he told them he wasn't feeling good and that's why I pulled the camera out and started recording,&quot; said Orta, adding that Garner was asthmatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the video, a clearly irate Garner shouts that he hasn't done anything wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time you see me, you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today,&quot; Garner shouts. &quot;I'm minding my business please just leave me alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner has been arrested 31 times since 1988 on charges such as drug possession, selling untaxed cigarettes and assault, police said. He was last arrested in May for selling untaxed cigarettes, court records show. Since 2009, he was arrested nine different times for selling such cigarettes, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner William Bratton and the mayor have expressed their desire to improve the relationship between officers and the community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a &quot;heavy heart,&quot; Mayor Bill de Blasio vowed a thorough investigation into the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a Staten Island man who died after police wrestled him to the ground for allegedly selling loose cigarettes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a terrible tragedy that occurred yesterday, and a terrible tragedy that no family should have to experience,&quot; Mr. de Blasio said this afternoon at Blue Room press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video posted by the New York Daily News shows Mr. Garner arguing with police that he had done nothing wrong - until a police officer wraps his arm around Mr. Garner's neck from behind him, taking him to the ground and then holding Mr. Garner's head against the sidewalk. Several other NYPD personnel gather around to restrain and cuff Mr.&nbsp;Garner as he shouts, &quot;I can't breathe! I can't breathe!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garner, 43,&nbsp;a father and grandfather who&nbsp;had asthma and weighed up to 400&nbsp;pounds according to several&nbsp;reports, died of cardiac arrest on the way to a hospital, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like so many New Yorkers, I was very troubled by the video I reviewed earlier today,&quot; Mr. de Blasio said. &quot;I have instructed Commissioner Bratton to ensure that there will be a full and thorough investigation of this incident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That investigation will be led by Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan, with assistance from NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. de Blasio repeatedly expressed sadness and sympathy for Mr. Garner - and concern about the actions of the NYPD personnel involved, including a 4-year and 8-year veteran who have been placed on desk duty - he said he couldn't jump to conclusions about the incident based on the video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I watched it the same way a family member would watch it, and I was very sad to watch it,&quot; Mr. de Blasio said. &quot;But that being said, we can't pass ultimate judgement based on one video.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chokeholds are prohibited by the NYPD's policies - because they can lead to death, Mr Bratton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As defined in the department's patrol guide, this would appear to have been a chokehold,&quot; Mr. Bratton said, based on the video he'd seen. &quot;The investigation held by the district attorney's office as well as our internal affairs will seek to make that final determination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest has sparked outrage from community leaders - Rev. Al Sharpton is set to hold two separate rallies Saturday - and elected officials who have decried that Mr. Garner was killed over the nonviolent crime of selling untaxed single cigarettes, known as &quot;loosies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Bratton told the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Observer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;that while it may seem like a &quot;small, maybe innocuous matter&quot; to some, it's not to local businesses and residents - and said it's one of the many quality of life issues &quot;the New York City Police Department is asked to address every single day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of those appalled by the death Friday had looked to Mr. de Blasio - who vowed to reform policies like stop and frisk - to change the NYPD. The mayor said he and Mr. Bratton were &quot;moving very consistently and energetically to create a series of reforms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This incident was tragedy. There will be a very thorough investigation,&quot; he told the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Observer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;But if you look at what's happening all over the city, I think you can safely say that real progress is being made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressed again by another reporter on whether such a response from the police was appropriate given the nonviolent crime, Mr. de Blasio said police officers are expected to respond to community complaints and enforce the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question of how you respond is a different matter, and I have real confidence that there's going to be again a very full and thorough investigation,&quot; Mr. de Blasio said, noting if officers have to be retrained, they will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses told the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">News</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Staten Island Advance</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;that Mr. Garner hadn't been selling cigarettes at all - though he'd reportedly been arrested for that before - but had just broken up a fight when officers approached him. In the video, Mr. Garner says he's done nothing wrong, asks the arresting officers not to touch him, and tries to move away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The video made quite apparent that the officers made it known to the deceased that they were intending to arrest him,&quot; Mr. Bratton said. &quot;He made it quite known to them that he was not going to allow that arrest to occur. I do not expect my officers to walk away from that type of situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. de Blasio held the press conference just hours before he is slated to board a flight to Italy for a 10-day vacation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the death of a man in NYPD custody on Staten Island spurred outrage and left many elected officials troubled, Mayor Bill de Blasio postponed his departure for a vacation in Italy, which had been scheduled for Friday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He thought it was important to be here tonight,&quot; a City Hall&nbsp;aide told reporters Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor will&nbsp;spend the night&nbsp;making calls to community leaders, though it had not been determined if he would speak to the family of the man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who died after police wrestled him to the ground in a chokehold for allegedly selling loose cigarettes. City Hall senior staff has spoken to Mr. Garner's family, the aide said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Mayor will postpone the departure for his upcoming family vacation to Saturday, in order to attend to City business. Updates to the Mayor's schedule will be provided as they become available,&quot; said spokesman Phil Walzak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor's family will depart with him sometime on Saturday, his office said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. de Blasio spent about an hour talking on the phone and meeting with senior staff on the plaza outside City Hall Friday, at times pacing and gesturing to his staff with his hands. When he walked back into the building, he would not take questions from reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll have more to say tomorrow,&quot; Mr. de Blasio said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A slew of elected officials released statements Friday about the death of Mr. Garner, questioning the NYPD's tactics and calling for an investigation. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Daily News</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> posted video of the incident.&nbsp;Mr. de Blasio told reporters in a late afternoon press conference - which ended not long before his scheduled departure - that he was &quot;troubled by the video&quot; of the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Al Sharpton has planned to hold two separate rallies Saturday - one at his National Action Network and one in Staten Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Walzak and two other staffers, Chief of Staff Laura Santucci and spokeswoman Monica Klein, are&nbsp;already in Italy. The mayor's office also announced Friday the cost of the three staffers attending the trip - $12,764.38, including flights, hotels and per diem expenses, with staffers paying their own way on legs of the trip without official business.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- A New York City police officer involved in the arrest of a man who died in custody after being placed in an apparent chokehold has been stripped of his gun and badge and placed on desk duty, police said Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Daniel Pantaleo, an 8-year NYPD veteran, and an officer who has been with the force for four years were both taken off the street after the death Thursday of 43-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Staten Island, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department would not identify the second officer but said he would retain his gun and badge while on desk duty. The reassignment is effective immediately and will remain in effect while Garner's death is being investigated, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association called Pantaleo's reassignment a &quot;knee-jerk reaction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Partial video of the encounter obtained by the New York Daily News shows the 6-foot-3, 350-pound Garner becoming irate and refusing to be handcuffed as officers tried to arrest him on suspicion of selling untaxed, loose cigarettes on a sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video then shows one of the officers placing Garner in what Police Commissioner William Bratton said Friday appeared to be a chokehold. The tactic, which can be fatal, is prohibited by departmental policy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HRABOVE, Ukraine (AP) -- Bowing to international pressure Monday, pro-Moscow separatists released a train packed with bodies and agreed to hand over the black boxes from the downed Malaysia Airlines plane, four days after it plunged into rebel-held eastern Ukraine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With body parts decaying in sweltering heat and signs that evidence at the crash site was mishandled, anger in Western capitals has mounted at the rebels and their allies in Moscow. Their reluctant cooperation will soothe mourning families and help investigators, but may do little to reconcile the East-West powers struggling over Ukraine's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia's Defense Ministry said it saw no evidence a missile was fired and denied involvement in the downing of Flight 17 -- and suggested the Ukrainian military was at fault. President Vladimir Putin spoke out but showed no sign of abandoning the separatists as fighting flared anew near the site of the crash. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama accused the rebels of tampering with evidence and insulting victims' families, warning of new sanctions. Europeans will consider their own sanctions Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bodies of the 298 victims, most from the Netherlands, have become a part of the conflict in Ukraine because they could hold evidence of what brought the plane down on July 17 as it was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aviation and defense experts say the victims' bodies could contain missile shrapnel. Chemical residue on the plane could confirm the type of weapon that brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. And the location of the wreckage could yield information on how the attack unfolded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black boxes could offer vital clues as well. The cockpit voice recorder would record the bang of a missile. The data recorders, which register altitude and position, would be able to tie that information to the timing of a known missile launch in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can effectively backtrack and give a relatively high degree of confidence in the location where that missile took off from,&quot; said a Manchester, England-based aviation industry consultant, Chris Yates. &quot;If that location happens to be in rebel-held territory, which we all suspect it is, that would be the first point where you could point the finger of blame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Red meat isn't very green: Study finds beef pollutes far more than pork, poultry, dairy, eggs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON (AP) -- Raising beef for the American dinner table does far more damage to the environment than producing pork, poultry, eggs or dairy, a new study says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compared with the other animal proteins, beef produces five times more heat-trapping gases per calorie, puts out six times as much water-polluting nitrogen, takes 11 times more water for irrigation and uses 28 times the land, according to the study, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cows are not efficient at converting feed to protein for human consumption, said lead author Gidon Eshel, an environmental physics professor at Bard College in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eshel used U.S.government figures to calculate air and water emissions and how much water and land were used in the lifetime production of beef, pork, poultry, dairy and eggs. While other studies have looked at the issue, this is one of the most comprehensive pieces of research quantifying and comparing the U.S. environmental costs of different meats and other animal protein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The beef industry called the study &quot;a gross oversimplification of the complex systems that make up the beef value chain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry joins diplomatic effort for new truce amid low expectations for breakthrough to end war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAIRO (AP) -- With high hopes but low expectations, the U.S. stepped up calls Monday for an international push to end fighting in the Gaza Strip as President Barack Obama sent his top envoy to the Mideast to help broker a new cease-fire between Israel and Hamas militants -- the third since 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voicing fresh concern about civilian casualties, Obama reaffirmed his belief that Israel has the right to defend itself against a barrage of more than 1,500 rockets being launched by Hamas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet he said Israel's military assault of Gaza had already done &quot;significant damage&quot; to Hamas' network of tunnels, safe havens and other infrastructure, and said he doesn't want to see more civilians getting killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have serious concerns about the rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths and the loss of Israeli lives,&quot; Obama said in Washington. &quot;And that is why it now has to be our focus and the focus of the international community to bring about a cease-fire that ends the fighting and can stop the deaths of innocent civilians, both in Gaza and in Israel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Obama spoke, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry flew to Cairo to join diplomatic efforts to resume a truce that last had been agreed to in November 2012. He will urge the militant Palestinian group to accept a cease-fire agreement offered by Egypt that would halt two weeks of fighting that has descended into war and killed at least 500 Palestinians and more than two-dozen Israelis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama bans discrimination against federal workers and contractors who are gay and transgender</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Barack Obama on Monday ordered employment protection for gay and transgender employees who work for the federal government or for companies holding federal contracts, telling advocates he embraced the &quot;irrefutable rightness of your cause.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America's federal contracts should not subsidize discrimination against the American people,&quot; Obama declared at a White House signing ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said it was unacceptable that being gay is still a firing offense in many places in the United States, and he called on Congress to extend the ban to all employers. But legislation that would extend the ban has become embroiled in a dispute over whether religious groups should get exemptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president had long resisted pressure to pursue an executive anti-discrimination order covering federal contractors in the hope that Congress would take more sweeping action. The Senate passed legislation last year with some Republican support, but it has not been considered by the GOP-controlled House. Now, said Obama, &quot;It's time to address this injustice for every American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mia Macy of Portland, Oregon, watched Obama's announcement in tears as an invited guest in the East Room. The military veteran and former Phoenix police detective applied to be a ballistics expert with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as a male but was rejected after she changed her name and began identifying as a woman. She filed a successful complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and settled a discrimination lawsuit against the government last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johns Hopkins to pay $190M after doctor secretly took gynecological images with tiny cameras</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BALTIMORE (AP) -- A &quot;rogue&quot; gynecologist who used tiny cameras to secretly record videos and photos of his patients has forced one of the world's top medical centers to pay $190 million to 8,000 women and girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Nikita Levy was fired after 25 years with the Johns Hopkins Health System in Baltimore in February 2013 after a female co-worker spotted the pen-like camera he wore around his neck and alerted authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Levy committed suicide days later, as a federal investigation led to roughly 1,200 videos and 140 images stored on computers in his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of these women were brutalized by this,&quot; said their lead attorney, Jonathan Schochor. &quot;Some of these women needed counseling, they were sleepless, they were dysfunctional in the workplace, they were dysfunctional at home, they were dysfunctional with their mates. This breach of trust, this betrayal -- this is how they felt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preliminary settlement approved by a judge Monday is one of the largest on record in the U.S. involving sexual misconduct by a physician. It all but closes a case that never produced criminal charges but seriously threatened Hopkins' reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Man who died in NYC chokehold case was a 'gentle giant,' friends say; investigation continues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a familiar figure on the streets near Staten Island's ferry docks: to his friends, a congenial giant with a generous gesture or a calming word; to police, a persistent face of the small-time crime of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's last run-in with police spiraled into a confrontation in which an officer applied an apparent chokehold, leaving the married father of six dead and police tactics under scrutiny. And it left some who knew him wondering why such conduct was used against a man they describe as a neighborhood peacemaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the ironic part about it. He's the most gentle of everybody over there,&quot; friend Irvine Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public anguish over Garner's death kept building Monday, as a small group of demonstrators gathered outside City Hall to demand the police commissioner's resignation. Medical examiners were working to pinpoint the cause of Garner's death, prosecutors and police internal affairs detectives were investigating officers' conduct in the encounter, and the Fire Department was probing paramedics' and emergency medication technicians' actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, 43, whose friends called him &quot;Big E&quot; and &quot;Teddy Bear,&quot; had a son starting college, five other children and two grandchildren, and a quarter-century-long relationship with his wife, Esaw. He'd had had a couple of temporary jobs with the city Parks Department in recent years, most recently helping with horticulture crews and maintenance in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexican 'coyotes': New wave of Central American migration puts light on decades-old smuggling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TECUN UMAN, Guatemala (AP) -- The man-in-the-know nursed a late-morning beer at a bar near the Suchiate River that separates Guatemala from Mexico, and answered a question about his human smuggling business with a question: &quot;Do you think a coyote is going to say he's a coyote?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dressed as a migrant in shorts and sandals but speaking like an entrepreneur, he then described shipments of tens of thousands of dollars in human cargo from the slums of Honduras and highlands of Guatemala to cities across the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's business,&quot; he said, agreeing to speak to a reporter only if guaranteed anonymity. &quot;Sometimes, business is very good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judging by the dramatic increase in the number of minors apprehended in the United States in recent months, it seems the human smuggling business from Central America is booming. The vast majority of migrants who enter the U.S. illegally do so with the help of a network of smugglers known as &quot;coyotes,&quot; so named for the scavengers that prowl the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a high-risk, often high-yield business estimated to generate $6.6 billion a year for smugglers along Latin America's routes to the U.S., according to a 2010 United Nations report. The migrants pay anywhere from $4,000 to $10,000 each for the illegal journey across thousands of miles in the care of smuggling networks that in turn pay off government officials, gangs operating on trains and drug cartels controlling the routes north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family says 2 American soldiers from Texas, California killed in Gaza Strip</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Max Steinberg and Nissim Sean Carmeli grew up in America and had a passion for Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their love of that nation led both to join the Israel Defense Forces and fight against Hamas in Gaza Strip, where they were killed on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steinberg, 24, and Carmeli, 21, were among 13 Israeli soldiers and 65 Palestinians who died during the first major ground battle in two weeks of fighting between Israel and Hamas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steinberg was part of an elite Golani infantry unit and had been working to locate terrorist tunnels and rocket launchers in Saja'iya when his armored vehicle was hit by an anti-tank rocket, said David Siegel, consul general of Israel in Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stuart Steinberg, whose family lives in the San Fernando Valley in California, said his son was a sharpshooter for the Golani Brigade. The family left Monday for Israel, where their son will be buried.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York City mayor Bill de Blasio (pictured) is promising a full investigation into the death of a man who appeared to have been put in a choke hold when police officers tried to arrest him. Part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> encounter with police was captured on an amateur video. Police say the 43-year-old father of six went into cardiac arrest while being arrested in Staten Island on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes. Video obtained by New York's Daily News shows an officer placing what appears to be a choke hold on the 1.9-metre, 159-kilogram man and several other officers pinning him against the footpath. </SPAN></P>
