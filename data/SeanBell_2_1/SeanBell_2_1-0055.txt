Three police officers surrendered yesterday to face charges in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man on his wedding day, an incident that stirred outrage around New York City. 
The officers were accused of firing nearly 50 shots at three young men in a car outside a nightclub, killing 
 and seriously wounding two of his friends.
Two other officers involved were not indicted.
The eight-count indictment charges detectives Michael Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Gerard Isnora, a decorated undercover officer who fired 11 shots, with first-degree and second-degree manslaughter, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said Monday.
Detective Marc Cooper, who fired four shots, faces a misdemeanour endangerment charge, Brown said.
Bell was killed on November 25 as he left his bachelor party.
Police have said that Bell's  car hit the unmarked police vehicle and that the officers believed someone in Bell's car was reaching for a gun when they opened fire. No gun was found.
