  Two New York police officers were charged with manslaughter and a third with reckless endangerment yesterday in the firing of 50 shots at three unarmed black men that killed a groom on his wedding day. 
 Two other officers were cleared in the death of 
 23. The charges failed to satisfy some activists who had been calling for murder indictments against all five, and drew criticism from the detectives' union, which called them excessive.
