<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE QUEENS COP who fired 31 shots into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> car hunkered down with his grandmother in New Jersey yesterday as more than 100 demonstrators gathered in lower Manhattan to protest the fatal shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days before Detective Michael Oliver is to surrender to face manslaughter charges, he stepped outside his family's Clifton, N.J., home only to shovel snow off the driveway, his lawyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the Hudson River, demonstrators marched from Union Square to Police Headquarters protesting the Nov. 25 shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grand jury voted Friday to indict Oliver and Detective Gescard Isnora on manslaughter charges and Detective Marc Cooper on a reckless endangerment charge in connection with the shooting that killed Bell on his wedding day. The indictments will be unsealed tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the trial begins, the Rev. Al Sharpton said, the men who survived the shooting - Trent Benefield, 23, and Joseph Guzman, 31 - expect the defense to wage a campaign of character assassination against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The downside is, they are going to come back . . . at these victims,&quot; Sharpton said on his radio show in Harlem. &quot;They're going to to try to make them look like the worst people that ever lived.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops are expected to turn themselves in to authorities at Queens Supreme Court at 7 a.m. tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Michael Hardy, an attorney for Benefield and Guzman, predicted it will be at least a year before the detectives go on trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The victims will try to survive in an environment where they have a target on their backs,&quot; Hardy said at Sharpton's Harlem headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other cops who fired their guns outside the Kalua Cabaret strip club, Detective Paul Headley and Officer Mike Carey, were not indicted - though they could face NYPD disciplinary charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said Guzman, Benefield and Bell's family derived no joy from the indictments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact is there ain't no pleasure in watching people having a perp walk,&quot; he said. &quot;It only reminds us how vulnerable we are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on New Yorkers to support Guzman and Benefield - both of whom have criminal records - during the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever they say about Guzman and Benefield, [they] didn't shoot anybody,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The jury needs to see that the community is outraged by the crimes that have been committed. We must have an organized court presence. . . . We must be out in full force to protect justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in Union Square, City Councilman Charles Barron (D-East New York) was much harsher and far more inflammatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't blame me for the explosion, because we're not taking this for much longer,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the system doesn't protect us, we have to protect ourselves from killer cops by any means necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
