<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policemen, accused of firing most of the 50 shots at three young men in a car outside a nightclub, were being fingerprinted and processed yesterday morning before their arraignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Gescard Isnora, who fired 11 bullets, face felony manslaughter charges, a source close to the investigation said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other officers involved in the shooting were not indicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a long way from a conviction,&quot; defence lawyer Philip Karasyk, who represents Mr Isnora, said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has renewed allegations that the New York Police Department is too fast on the trigger and sparked protests by activists who say the department is racial profiling, a claim city officials deny.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other two officers - one black and one white - were not charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While relatives of the victims waited for the Queens district attorney to unseal the indictment yesterday, some were angry about reports of a lavish weekend party involving one of the indicted men.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't really know what he was celebrating,&quot; Denise Ford, whose son Trent Benefield was shot and seriously wounded the night Bell was killed, said. A third friend, Joseph Guzman, was also wounded in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
