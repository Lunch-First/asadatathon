<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not even an indictment can keep disgraced detective Michael Oliver from a party. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cop charged with shooting 31 of the 50 shots at unarmed groom-to-be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spent the night after getting charged with manslaughter enjoying a lavish $4,200 dinner at celebrity hot spot Nello.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver had an hourlong dinner at 7 p.m. yesterday with four young hotties and the man who picked up the check, Jos&eacute; Garcia, Oliver's friend from Spain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unmarried Oliver was particularly flirty with one foxy brunette, said sources inside the restaurant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was overheard talking about the case, although he didn't appear agitated until he spotted waiting photographers and started talking testily into his cellphone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have nothing to say. I'll see what happens,&quot; he said after exiting the eatery at 62nd Street and Madison Avenue. &quot;I have no comment. Talk to my lawyer.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the women said the group was holding a birthday celebration, but didn't say for whom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They dined on four orders of dover sole, and two plates of pasta with truffles. The latter goes for a whopping $180 a pop. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They washed down the fine food with five $575 bottles of Brunello di Montalcino wine, then closed the meal with a dessert of tiramisu, apple pie and sips of Frangelico. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Garcia settled the tab, which closed out at $4,241.50, Oliver left in a hurry, with one of the sexy table guests in tow, to avoid waiting photographers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then to dodge questions about Bell's death, he ducked behind a building. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debonair bachelor was known as &quot;Undercover Mike&quot; during his days probing the Chelsea club scene as the member of an NYPD Vice Squad cracking down on nightlife crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One source said that throughout the grand-jury proceedings, Oliver was seen partying at Chelsea club Cain on West 27th Street. He was apparently dating one of the bar's hostesses.     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional reporting by Leela De Kretser and Michael Scholl </SPAN></P>
