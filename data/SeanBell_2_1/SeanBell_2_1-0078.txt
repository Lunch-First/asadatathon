At his first public appearance since three police officers were indicted in the 
 killing, the mayor clarified his position on the conduct of the police that night.
At a press conference on the West Side, Bloomberg told reporters he never said "anybody broke the law. It's not my job to decide whether somebody broke a law. And, you know, I made my comments as a civilian."
The civilian "comments" he's referring to were made the day after the shooting in the Blue Room, when Bloomberg said he thought police used "excessive" force.-- Azi Paybarah
