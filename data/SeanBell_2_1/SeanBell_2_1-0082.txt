Three police officers charged in a 50-bullet barrage that killed an unarmed groom on his wedding day appeared before a judge yesterday and had their first encounter since the shooting with the victims and their families. 
In a packed, tension-filled courtroom, the three officers stood with their hands clasped during the 20-minute hearing as they pleaded not guilty in the shooting that killed 
 23, and wounded two others.
The officers fired 46 of the 50 shots. The judge set bail for the two officers who fired the most bullets and released the other without bail.
Queens District Attorney Richard Brown yesterday unsealed the indictment charging Detectives Michael Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Gescard Isnora, a decorated undercover officer who fired 11 times, with first-degree and second-degree manslaughter.
If convicted of the most serious charges, the detectives would receive mandatory prison time - up to 25 years.
