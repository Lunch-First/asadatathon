An undercover detective was indicted by a grand jury for manslaughter not because he fired the shot that killed groom 

 but because he fired the first shot, The Post has learned.  
The Queens grand jury agreed with the prosecution's argument that Detective Gescard Isnora should be charged with manslaughter because he was the first of the five cops to fire outside a Queens strip joint on Nov. 25, a court source said. 
By shooting at Bell and pals Trent Benefield, 23, and Joseph Guzman, 31, prosecutors say, Isnora created the situation that caused another officer, Michael Oliver, also charged with manslaughter, to open fire. 
The source said prosecutors hoped to prove that Isnora's recklessness created a situation that caused "unjustifiable risk of death" and "created the grave cause of the death." 
That is one standard for manslaughter.     
Another officer, Marc Cooper, was indicted for reckless endangerment.     
The charges 
*  Detective Michael Oliver, 35 -  Manslaughter Fired 31 shots, including bullet that killed 


*  Detective Marc Cooper, 39 - Reckless endangerment. Shot four bullets. 
*  Detective Gescard Isnora, 28 - Manslaughter, Fired 11 times, including the first shot on the scene
