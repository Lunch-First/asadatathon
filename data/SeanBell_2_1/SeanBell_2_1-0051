<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg is standing by his comment that the police used &quot;excessive force&quot; when they killed an unarmed man in Queens the night before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the fatal shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in November, Mr. Bloomberg said the 50 shots fired by police seemed &quot;unacceptable&quot; and &quot;inexplicable.&quot; At the time, police and detective union officials said those types of comments could undermine the officers' chances of getting a fair hearing. On Monday, three of the five officers involved in the shooting were indicted. In the months since Bell's killing, Mr. Bloomberg has avoided using the same language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked yesterday whether he stood by his initial comments the mayor said, &quot;I just said I did.&quot; He added, &quot;I expressed my opinion as a layman, which I have a right to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the Detectives Endowment Association, Michael Palladino, said in an interview that Mr. Bloomberg's remarks &quot;certainly go a long way in poisoning a jury pool.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bloomberg said a change of venue for the trial is up to the District Attorney.</SPAN></P>
