<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the opinion of lawyers who represented the four cops acquitted in the killing of Amadou Diallo in a hail of 41 bullets in 1999.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts said that's partly because the system is inherently skewed against venue changes and also because the case will likely be heard months from now, during which time publicity about it will likely subside.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Brounstein, who represented Officer Kenneth Boss in Diallo's death, said, &quot;Right now, I think there's a lot of negative publicity. I'd ask for a change of venue right now.&quot; But asked if he thought he would be successful, he replied, &quot;I wouldn't bet on that one.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Patten, who represented Officer Sean Carroll in the shooting, agreed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts said getting a change of venue in the Bell case would be difficult also because it occurred in Queens, where such a motion is possible only after there has been an attempt to pick a jury.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Diallo shooting, in The Bronx, fell in a judicial district that allows change-of-venue motions to be made at any time. That trial was moved to Albany. </SPAN></P>
