<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - Three of the five policemen whose 50-bullet barrage killed an unarmed man on his wedding day were indicted Friday in a case that heightened racial tensions and renewed allegations that the city's officers are too fast on the trigger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorneys for officers Marc Cooper, Gerscard Isnora and Michael Oliver said their clients had been indicted, but they did not know what offenses the officers had been charged with. Grand jurors had considered charges including murder, manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three officers fired the most shots - Cooper, 4, Isnora, 11, and Oliver, 31 - in the Nov. 25 confrontation that killed 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and wounded two of his friends as they left Bell's bachelor party at a strip club in Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting stirred outrage around New York City and led to accusations of racism against police. Bell was black, as are two of his friends who were wounded in the shooting. Cooper and Isnora are black. Oliver is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">District Attorney Richard A. Brown said only that the grand jury had reached a decision and it would be announced Monday. He gave no reason for the delay, but indictments are often kept sealed until attorneys and their clients are notified and arrangements can be made for the defendants to surrender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A person familiar with the case told the AP that the other two officers in the shooting - one black and one white - were not charged. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the grand jury's decision has not been made public.</SPAN></P>
