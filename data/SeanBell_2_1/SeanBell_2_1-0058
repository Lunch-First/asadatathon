<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) -- Three police officers charged in a 50-shot barrage that killed an unarmed bridegroom on his wedding day had their first encounter since the shooting with the victims and their families Monday in a packed courtroom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three officers, who fired 46 of the 50 shots, stood staunchly, hands clasped, throughout the 20-minute hearing as they pleaded not guilty in the shooting that killed 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and wounded two of his friends. The judge set bail for the two officers who fired the most shots and released the other without bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shooting victims Joseph Guzman, in a wheelchair, and Trent Benefield, using a crutch, attended with Nicole Paultre Bell, who was engaged to Bell and legally took his name after he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard Brown on Monday unsealed the indictment charging Detectives Michael Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Gescard Isnora, a decorated undercover officer who fired 11 times, with first-degree and second-degree manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectives would face mandatory prison time -- up to 25 years -- if they are convicted of the top charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver also was charged with endangerment for a bullet that smashed through the window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third officer, Detective Marc Cooper, was charged with a misdemeanor in the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHITE PLAINS (AP) -- A young man who killed one friend and hurt another in two car crashes while driving impaired was sentenced Monday to one to three years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ralph Tarchine III, 19, of Bedford, had pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter and driving while impaired in a December crash and vehicular assault and driving while intoxicated in a January crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Plunkett, 17, of Ridgefield, Conn., was killed in the first accident. While that was being investigated, Tarchine and a passenger were seriously injured in the second crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there was anything I could do to bring Mike back, I would do it, even if it meant dying myself,&quot; Tarchine told acting State Supreme Court Justice Richard Molea before being sentenced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His parents wept in the gallery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tarchine had nearly escaped with a plea deal that would have sentenced him to just six months in the county jail and probation. But the deal outraged the victims' families, and the judge threw it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He gave Tarchine the chance to withdraw his guilty plea and go to trial, but Tarchine decided to accept a prison sentence.</SPAN></P>
