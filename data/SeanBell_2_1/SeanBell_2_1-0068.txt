Three New York police officers surrendered on Monday to face charges over a shooting last November that left an unarmed black man dead on his wedding day.
The police officers are accused of firing most of the 50 shots at three young men in a car outside a nightclub.
Michael Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Gescard Isnora, who fired 11 bullets, face felony manslaughter and first-degree assault charges.
Marc Cooper, who fired four shots, faces a misdemeanour endangerment charge.
The November 25 shooting killed 
 and severely injured two of his bachelor party guests.
