Mayor Bloomberg just couldn't leave well enough alone, could he?  
Following this week's indictment of three cops in the fatal shooting of 
 Mayor Mike declared that he stood behind his initial public assessment of the incident, when he declared that the officers had used "excessive force."   
The mayor also had called the shooting "unacceptable."  
Since the initial uproar over his comments, Bloomberg took care not to repeat them. This week, however, he insisted that "I expressed my opinion as a layman, which I have a right to do."  
Sorry, Mike, but the mayor of New York isn't just your average Joe Citizen.  
And when he weighs in on potentially criminal matters involving New York City police officers - especially a situation that threatens to ignite simmering tensions in the city - he is far from "a layman."  
Don't be surprised, in other words, if lawyers for the indicted cops pounce on Bloomberg's latest pronouncement as the basis for a legal motion to move the trial out of the five boroughs - just as the trial of the cops who shot Amadou Diallo was moved to Albany.  
They'd likely be on pretty solid ground.   
(Not that the mayor seems to understand this. In the same interview, he said that Queens DA Richard Brown "is the one who will decide as to whether or not there is a need for a change in venue." In fact, the call gets made made by judges on the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court.)  
The point here is that Mike Bloomberg, like every other citizen, is entitled to have opinions about anything and everything under the sun.  
But as chief executive of the city, he needs to think first and consider all the possible repercussions before sharing those opinions with the public.
