The officers are accused of firing nearly 50 shots at three young men in a car outside a nightclub, killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and seriously wounding two of his friends. Two other officers involved were not indicted. The eight-count indictment charges detectives Michael Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Gescard Isnora, a decorated undercover officer who fired 11 shots, with first-degree and second-degree manslaughter, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said. Those charges are classified as violent felonies with mandated jail time if the men are convicted. The maximum punishment for manslaughter is 25 years, Brown said. Detective Marc Cooper, who fired four shots, faces a misdemeanor endangerment charge, Brown said. The indictment says Cooper fired a bullet that went through the window of an occupied train station.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">might not stick</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO -- Duct tape's success at curing warts may have been overstated, according to a new study that raises doubts about the tape's effectiveness as a cheap, painless treatment. The tape supposedly works by irritating the skin and stimulating the body's immune system to attack the virus that causes warts. It earned a place in the medicine cabinet in 2002, when a small study showed it to be effective on children and young adults. This time, a study among older adults found duct tape helped only 21 percent of the time and was no better than moleskin, a cotton-tape bandage used to protect the skin. But researchers used transparent duct tape. Only later did they learn that the transparent variety does not contain rubber, unlike the better-known, gray duct tape that appeared to be effective in the 2002 study. &quot;Whether or not the standard type of duct tape is effective is up in the air,&quot; said co-author Dr. Rachel Wenner of the University of Minnesota, who started the new study as a medical student. &quot;Theoretically, the rubber adhesive could somehow stimulate the immune system or irritate the skin in a different manner.&quot; The new study appears in the March issue of Archives of Dermatology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Postage increase,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">'forever' stamp OK'd</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The cost of mailing a letter will go up by 2 cents on May 14, but you'll be able to lock in that price -- no matter how rates rise in the future -- by buying the new &quot;forever&quot; stamp. The post office governing board agreed Monday to accept the new 41-cent rate for first-class mail recommended in February by the independent Postal Regulatory Commission. The board also agreed to the proposal for the forever stamp, which will always be valid for mailing a letter no matter how much rates increase. James C. Miller III, chairman of the postal board, said the forever stamp could go on sale as soon as next month, at the 41-cent rate. While a forever stamp will always be valid for mailing a letter, that doesn't mean the price won't go up. If rates were to increase to 45 cents, for example, that's what a forever stamp would sell for. But stamps already purchased at a lower rate could still be used without adding extra postage.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">in Siberian mine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW -- A methane gas explosion deep in a Siberian coal mine killed at least 78 people and left another 50 trapped Monday in Russia's worst mining disaster in a decade. Among the missing were company officials and safety experts who had been inspecting a British-made hazard-monitoring system, said Sergei Cheremnov, a spokesman for the regional government in Kemerovo where the mine is located, about 1,850 miles east of Moscow. A British man and his interpreter were among those killed, he said. It was unclear what the two were doing in the mine. As many as 200 workers were in the Ulyanovskaya mine when the explosion occurred about 885 feet underground in the coal-rich southern region known as the Kuzbass, emergency and regional officials said. At least 75 people were rescued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Malaria-resistant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">mosquito developed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Re-searchers have developed a malaria-resistant mosquito, a step that might one day help block the spread of an illness that has claimed millions of lives around the world. When they fed on malaria-infected mice, the resistant mosquitoes had a higher survival rate than nonresistant ones, meaning they could eventually replace the ones that can carry the disease, according to a report in today's issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Jason Rasgon of the department of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University cautioned that the research so far is only proof of principle, and any field tests remain far away. Nonetheless, it's a goal eagerly sought by scientists in hope of developing a practical way of blocking the spread of malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Hamas takes credit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">for Israeli's shooting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KARNI CROSSING, Gaza Strip -- Hamas militants on Monday claimed responsibility for a shooting that wounded an Israeli civilian near the border with the Gaza Strip -- the first serious violence after formation of the new Palestinian unity government. The shooting dealt an embarrassing blow to Hamas political leaders, who have been trying to persuade the international community to recognize their coalition with the rival Fatah movement and lift a year-old economic boycott against the Palestinian government. It also exposed divisions within the Islamic militant group. Israel said the attack proved the coalition was flouting international demands to renounce violence, recognize Israel's right to exist, and accept past peace accords.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">for missing Scout</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGRADY, N.C. -- Search crews climbed across a heavily wooded mountain area in western North Carolina on Monday, looking for a 12-year-old boy who disappeared during a weekend camping trip with his Boy Scout troop. Michael Auberry vanished in the rugged terrain surrounding the Blue Ridge Parkway on Saturday after lunch with the other Scouts. Searchers found his mess kit within a mile of the campsite, but no new clues had surfaced Monday, officials said. &quot;We're hopeful he was able to find shelter. There are a number of rock crevasses, and he could have covered himself up with leaves,&quot; said Mike Lambert, a ranger with North Carolina State Parks. Michael was dressed for the weather, his mother said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Election officials in Ohio told to resign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLEVELAND -- All four election board members for Cuyahoga County, troubled by recount-rigging accusations and voting machine problems, have been told to resign or face being fired, a state official said Monday. Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner said she called the four board members of Ohio's most populous county late Sunday, asking them to leave by close of business Wednesday. The county, which includes all of Cleveland, has had difficulty adjusting to electronic voting. Last May's primary, the first attempt at electronic voting in the county, was marred by absent or poorly trained poll workers, lost vote-holding computer cards and a polling place that opened hours late.</SPAN></P>
