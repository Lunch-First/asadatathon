NEW YORK Two policemen were charged with manslaughter and a third with reckless endangerment after 50 shots fired at three unarmed black men killed a groom on his wedding day. Two other officers were cleared over the death of 
 23, which prompted allegations of brutality and racial profiling by police and led to street protests and activists' demands for murder indictments.
