<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three people were arrested after a scuffle broke out with counterprotesters near the end of the 90-minute rally, but no other violence was reported. The event drew about 500 bystanders who booed and held anti-hate signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group chose the small town for the rally in response to a controversy two months ago at a local college. Tarleton State students held an off-campus party on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and ate fried chicken, drank malt liquor from bottles wrapped in brown paper bags, and dressed as Aunt Jemima and other black stereotypes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school later chastised them and held a student forum to discuss race relations and a unity rally. At least one student shown in party photos posted on the Internet later apologized. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLINTON PROMISES MORE COMPETENT ADMINISTRATION: Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton praised residents of Houston on Saturday for their help in responding to Hurricane Katrina and said that if elected she would lead a more competent government than the Bush administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to have leadership again that asks us to step up and show the world who Americans are and what we can do,&quot; Clinton said during her first visit to Texas since announcing her candidacy. She met with supporters at a breakfast before speaking at the Wesley African Methodist Episcopal Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticizing the Bush administration on a range of issues, the New York senator said she would create a universal pre-kindergarten program, provide health care for all Americans and generate jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BODIES OF DIVERS RECOVERED: Authorities on Saturday recovered the bodies of two divers from a sunken U.S. military ship off the Florida Keys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bodies of Jonathan Walsweer, 38, and Scott Stanley, whose age wasn't known, had been trapped in the USS Spiegel Grove, authorities said. The body of a third diver, Kevin Coughlin, 51, was recovered Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men, all from New Jersey, were exploring the wreck Friday and attempting to venture inside, the Monroe County Sheriff's Office said. It wasn't immediately clear how they died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO NYC OFFICERS FACE MANSLAUGHTER CHARGES: Two police officers involved in a 50-bullet barrage that killed an unarmed man on his wedding day were indicted on charges of manslaughter, and a third faces a misdemeanor charge, a person familiar with the investigation said Saturday in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers were indicted Friday by a grand jury that had deliberated for three days over whether to bring charges in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was shot while leaving a bachelor party last November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Oliver, who fired 31 of the shots, and Gescard Isnora, who fired 11, face the felony manslaughter charges, according to a person who spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the indictment is sealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marc Cooper, who fired four shots, faces the misdemeanor endangerment charge, the person said. The indictment is to be unsealed Monday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PALESTINIAN COALITION GOVERNMENT BEGINS REIGN: Palestinians installed a new, more moderate coalition government on Saturday, in hopes of persuading the international community to end its isolation of the Palestinian Authority and lift a year of bruising sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel promptly announced it wouldn't deal with the coalition, because governing partners Hamas and Fatah stopped short of explicitly recognizing the Jewish state or renouncing violence, as the international community has demanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the new alliance, which replaced the militantly anti-Israel government led by the Islamic Hamas, appeared to implicitly recognize Israel by calling for a Palestinian state on lands the Israelis captured in 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush administration found little good to say Saturday about the coalition government, which falls short of Western demands and complicates U.S. plans to revive long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said part of the platform announced Saturday is disturbing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FORMER NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT'S PAROLE LOOSENED: A former Nicaraguan President convicted of money laundering and embezzlement was freed from the conditions of his parole and allowed to travel around the country, a move critics said Saturday was a ploy by President Daniel Ortega to weaken the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former president Arnoldo Aleman, who acknowledged last month he spent $1.8 million in government money on jewelry and meals while seeking hurricane aid abroad in 1998, was convicted in 2003 and sentenced to a 20-year prison term. He was later granted parole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the National Penitentiary System loosened the condition of Aleman's parole that had limited him to the capital, allowing him to travel throughout Nicaragua. Aleman embarked on a national tour Saturday to promote what he called reconciliation in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FORMER MILOSEVIC AIDE ARRESTED IN MONEY SHIFT: A key aide to late Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has been arrested for allegedly syphoning off millions of dollars of state money and transferring it to accounts in Cyprus and elsewhere, police said Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indictment alleges that Mihalj Kertes organized the scheme on Milosevic's orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compiled by Joey Berlin from wire reportsLOS ANGELES - Cate Blanchett is in negotiations to star opposite Harrison Ford in the long-awaited fourth installment of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series, her publicist confirmed Saturday.</SPAN></P>
