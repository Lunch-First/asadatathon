IN THE WEE hours of Nov. 25, two days after Thanksgiving, the Kalua Cabaret club was jammed with men appreciating the performances of several strippers. 
Among them was 
 who would be dead before the sun rose, killed in a fusillade of 50 police bullets.
When three of the cops involved in the fatal shooting were indicted Friday, the Kalua Cabaret was like a morgue. Only a handful of customers were around the dimly lit bar, sipping drinks and watching a stripper go through her paces.
But the grand jury's decision elicited strong emotions. "It's a start. Now let's investigate the whole precinct," said a bar manager, who described himself as a friend of Bell.
"The cop who emptied his gun and reloaded should do time for all of them. Bottom line," a balding bouncer said, referring to Detective Michael Oliver, who fired 31 of the 50 shots and was hit with manslaughter charges.
A maintenance man who lives nearby said, "Now, the cops will know they can't just roll on us. There are consequences."
But others seemed not to care. Asked what she thought, a stripper with smudged eyeliner flashed her G-string and replied, "Oh, I don't know about that. But you're beautiful."
