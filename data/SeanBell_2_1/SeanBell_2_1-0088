<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detective indicted for reckless endangerment for his role in the 50-bullet barrage that killed groom-to-be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was charged because of an errant shot that struck an AirTrain platform - narrowly missing passengers, The Post has learned.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said the four rounds Marc Cooper, 39, fired during the Nov. 25 Queens shooting did not hit victims Bell, Trent Benefield or Joseph Guzman.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His [grand jury] testimony was clear,&quot; said Cooper's lawyer, Paul Martin. &quot;He heard a crash, saw a barrage, crouched down, put one leg out and began firing in the direction of the threat.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield and Guzman, who were wounded in the fusillade, will be in court today to watch as Cooper is arraigned along with Detectives Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora, both of whom are charged with manslaughter in the sensational case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time since the shooting, &quot;Benefield and Guzman will be facing the people who altered their lives forever,&quot; said the Rev. Al Sharpton.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil-rights leader said he expects a &quot;very charged atmosphere&quot; in court, where he will be joined by a large group of the victims' relatives and friends.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We intend to maintain our dignity. We'll see how they behave,&quot; Sharpton added, referring to the heavy police presence expected both for crowd control and in support of the detectives.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said he was disturbed when he spotted the front page of yesterday's Post, which showed Oliver leaving celebrity hangout Nello with two women after a $4,200 dinner with pals.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a strange way to prepare for an arraignment,&quot; Sharpton said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night of fine dining included five $575 bottles of wine.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tab was picked up by Oliver's pal Jos&eacute; Garcia, a big-spending regular at the Chelsea hotspot Cain. The two met there during Oliver's visits as a customer, not while he was working undercover with the vice squad.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At least we know he has friends who can help him post bond,&quot; Sharpton said dryly of Oliver.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said that Oliver and Garcia - who lives in Washington, D.C. and works in finance - dined with Cain waitress Laurel Henley and another woman named Toby.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources close to the Chelsea club scene said Oliver, who fired 31 of the 50 shots, spent at least three nights a week at Cain during the grand-jury proceedings. He has since been barred from the club for reasons that include not paying his bar tabs, the sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver is currently dating former Cain hostess Tara Lee Borsman, who has signed a contract to work at the club's Bahamas location, Cain at the Cove, the sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to reach Oliver were unsuccessful.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Palladino, president of the Detective's Endowment Association, said he didn't appreciate Sharpton's comments.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remind Sharpton that his new clients were partying into the wee hours of the morning in the club Kalua, which is nothing more than a dump overrun with guns, prostitution and drugs,&quot; Palladino said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only Sharpton in his warped mind could draw a nexus between the shooting and Officer Oliver having dinner in a legitimate establishment.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
