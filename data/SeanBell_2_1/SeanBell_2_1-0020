<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE THREE detectives indicted in the fatal shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> face an uphill legal battle fraught with tough decisions that may ultimately decide the case, legal experts said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can they get a fair trial in Queens or should they seek a change of venue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Request a trial by judge or jury? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To testify or not to testify?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do not underestimate how difficult it is to defend a police officer,&quot; said defense lawyer John Scarpa, a former Queens assistant district attorney who 20 years ago prosecuted cops in the infamous 106th Precinct stun-gun torture case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jurors are predisposed to hold cops to a higher standard, so although the prosecutor has the burden to prove they're guilty, the burden probably shifts in police cases, and cops have to show their actions were reasonable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Detectives Gescard Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper are booked, their mug shots taken and they are released on bail Monday, the march to trial begins with a review of the grand jury presentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense sources believe Isnora and Oliver are charged with manslaughter and Cooper with reckless endangerment, although the indictment remains sealed. The grand jurors simply concluded that there was more evidence than not that the detectives had committed a crime - a far lower standard than the reasonable doubt threshold at trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though all five cops involved in the Nov. 25 shooting testified before the grand jury, experts say it's no shock three were unable to head off an indictment, since defense lawyers couldn't cross-examine witnesses or put their spin on the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The defense should be able to turn this on its head at trial,&quot; said attorney Joseph Tacopina. &quot; 'Reckless' is a very subjective term. There's no question there was some improper conduct by the victims, and the cops thought their lives were in danger,&quot; he noted, referring to Bell driving his auto toward Isnora and a police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the coming weeks, the defense will file motions to review the grand jury minutes for legal errors, followed by the release of a mountain of forensic reports and statements made by cops and witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I personally know [that] the assistant district attorney in charge of the investigation, Charles Testagrossa, is a person of the highest integrity, and I am certain he did his best to make a fair presentation to the grand jury,&quot; Scarpa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops cleared in the 1999 fatal shooting of unarmed Amadou Diallo successfully transferred the trial from the Bronx to Albany, but any decision to change the venue in this case won't be made until after the defense has reviewed the evidence and learned which Supreme Court justice will preside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think a change of venue motion would be appropriate, especially if the negative publicity continues,&quot; said attorney Steve Brounstein, who defended Officer Kenneth Boss in the Diallo case. &quot;This is going to be a fight, but they don't have to make those decisions now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deciding whether a defendant will testify is usually a trial-time decision, but it is virtually certain the detectives' best chance of acquittal rests on justifying their actions in their own words, the experts agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides also will line up experts on police tactics and firearms training to argue that the officers violated procedures or reacted as best they could to a chaotic situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police shootings by multiple officers are not always clear-cut because of their different perceptions of what's happening,&quot; said retired NYPD Capt. Edward Mamet, who has testified as an expert in police practices.</SPAN></P>
