<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO New York police officers involved in the shooting death of an unarmed black man just hours before he was due to marry have been charged with manslaughter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two were among five officers involved in the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, who was gunned down in a hail of bullets last year November as he was leaving a nightclub in Queens. He had been due to get married just hours later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two undercover detectives, Gescard Isnora, who is black, and Michael Oliver, who is white, were charged with intentional and reckless manslaughter and face up to 25 years in jail if convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third officer, detective Marc Cooper, was charged with reckless endangerment and faces one year in jail if convicted. The three surrendered in New York yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting triggered anger and protests in New York, amid allegations that the incident reflected racism in the New York Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora fired the first shot, but it was the firing of 31 shots by Oliver -- a feat that required him to reload his weapon -- that has angered many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undercover police staking out the Queens nightclub fired about 50 shots at Bell and two friends, killing him and wounding the two men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigations have hinged on conflicting reports over whether there may have been a fourth man with Bell, armed with a gun, who later fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police were put on standby last week amid fears that a decision not to indict any of the officers would lead to riots.</SPAN></P>
