THE QUEENS judge chosen to preside over the 
 police shooting case has a history of slamming cop haters, including one involved in a recent controversial case.
Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman, who gets the case April 11 after his name was plucked randomly out of a drum yesterday, jailed a man who bit a cop, even though imprisonment wasn't mandatory in the 2004 case. 
He also handed down a sentence of 52 years to life in 1990 to Jay Harrison, convicted of murdering two detectives.
But the judge is most hailed by police for his role in jailing William Hodges.
Accused of shooting a police officer, Hodges became a cause clbre for cops in 2002 after Queens Supreme Court Justice Laura Blackburne freed him on a technicality. Blackburne was eventually thrown off the bench for helping a different suspect escape a detective trying to arrest him.
Hodges' luck seemed to hold when he escaped an assault rap and was convicted only of a minor charge - but Cooperman sentenced him to the maximum year in jail.
Still, Cooperman, who served 10 years in the Assembly and was first elected to the Supreme Court in 1982, was described by one lawyer as a "straight shooter" well-qualified for a controversial case.
"He's highly intelligent and can handle the job," said the insider, noting that Cooperman has also sentenced police convicted of attacking civilians.
In 1986, Cooperman sentenced two ex-cops to two-to-six years in prison for torturing a teenage drug suspect with a stun gun.
The crime was "an affront to the honest and honorable police officers who carry out their sworn duties in conformance with the law," he was quoted as saying.
One of the best things the 73-year-old jurist may have going for him is his age, said another court insider.
"His career is mostly behind him," he said, noting that an older judge is less likely to be affected by the highly charged politics of the case.
