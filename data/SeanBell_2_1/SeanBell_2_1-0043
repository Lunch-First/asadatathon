<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg just couldn't leave well enough alone, could he?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following this week's indictment of three cops in the fatal shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mayor Mike declared that he stood behind his initial public assessment of the incident, when he declared that the officers had used &quot;excessive force.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor also had called the shooting &quot;unacceptable.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the initial uproar over his comments, Bloomberg took care not to repeat them. This week, however, he insisted that &quot;I expressed my opinion as a layman, which I have a right to do.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorry, Mike, but the mayor of New York isn't just your average Joe Citizen.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when he weighs in on potentially criminal matters involving New York City police officers - especially a situation that threatens to ignite simmering tensions in the city - he is far from &quot;a layman.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't be surprised, in other words, if lawyers for the indicted cops pounce on Bloomberg's latest pronouncement as the basis for a legal motion to move the trial out of the five boroughs - just as the trial of the cops who shot Amadou Diallo was moved to Albany.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They'd likely be on pretty solid ground.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Not that the mayor seems to understand this. In the same interview, he said that Queens DA Richard Brown &quot;is the one who will decide as to whether or not there is a need for a change in venue.&quot; In fact, the call gets made made by judges on the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court.)  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point here is that Mike Bloomberg, like every other citizen, is entitled to have opinions about anything and everything under the sun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as chief executive of the city, he needs to think first and consider all the possible repercussions before sharing those opinions with the public. </SPAN></P>
