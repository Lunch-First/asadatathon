<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE REV. AL Sharpton said there was &quot;no joy&quot; in the victims' camp over the indictment of three of the five cops in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the Queens apartment complex where one of the wounded men lives, residents were sipping Moet champagne from plastic cups last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're laughing right now - but we have so much pain,&quot; said a 36-year-old tenant who joined the impromptu celebration at Baisley Park Gardens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Sharpton's National Action Network headquarters in Harlem, reaction was more muted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre-Bell, stood silently with his wounded pals, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no joy, no vengeance, no party here,&quot; Sharpton declared. &quot;We are not looking for revenge. We are looking for it to not happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only way you make sure it doesn't happen again is you stop it, and you punish it, and you send a signal that we live in a society where laws have to be respected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said he took &quot;no pleasure&quot; in the fact that the families of Detectives Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper will have to endure a trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He even invoked the memory of the two auxiliary police officers executed in cold blood in Greenwich Village this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the ugliest things that occurred was the killing of those auxiliary police the other night,&quot; he said. &quot;But it was just as ugly for the police to break the law and shoot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After word of the indictments leaked out, it was Sharpton who told Bell's fianc&eacute;e, whom he was to marry the day he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nicole was quiet and somber and reflective,&quot; he said. &quot;Joe [Guzman] was more expressive. He was like, 'Okay, let's go.' Trent was quiet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer for Guzman, Benefield and Paultre-Bell said they had hoped for charges against all five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But attorney Michael Hardy said indictments for the two responsible for the most shots - Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Isnora, who fired 11 - &quot;were nonnegotiable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are encouraged by the rumors of who was indicted and what the charges are,&quot; Hardy said. &quot;The family is more hopeful today than yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members, friends and neighbors were disappointed but not enraged that the two cops who fired the fewest shots - Officer Michael Carey and Detective Paul Headley - won't be charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll take the sliding scale,&quot; said Bishop Lester Williams, who was supposed to preside at Bell's wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mostly, they sounded grateful that someone will be held accountable for Bell's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people have been on edge about it,&quot; said Bishop Erskine Williams, a spokesman for Benefield and Guzman. &quot;But I think the fever is breaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that people are going to now regain their confidence in the criminal justice system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also emphasized that the grand jury action is just the first step in a long process with an uncertain ending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's still not over,&quot; said Guzman's sister, Yolanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's good to see, but nothing that happens can bring Sean back and nothing can get my brother back to the way he was. He is a different man now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was also the sentiment at La Bella Vita catering hall, where Bell's wedding reception would have been held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It still hurts, and I will never forget how terrible the day Sean died was,&quot; said owner Tony Modica. &quot;Nothing can bring him back, but today we saw the law begin to do what is right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
