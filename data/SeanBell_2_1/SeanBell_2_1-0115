<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Three of the five policemen whose 50-bullet barrage killed an unarmed man on his wedding day were indicted Friday in a case that heightened racial tensions and renewed allegations that the city's officers are too fast on the trigger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorneys for officers Marc Cooper, Gerscard Isnora and Michael Oliver said their clients had been indicted, but they did not know what offenses the officers had been charged with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three officers fired the most shots - Cooper, 4, Isnora, 11, and Oliver, 31 - in the Nov. 25 confrontation that killed 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and wounded two of his friends as they left Bell's bachelor party at a strip club in Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting stirred outrage around New York City and led to accusations of racism against police. Bell was black, as are two of his friends who were wounded in the shooting. Cooper and Isnora are black. Oliver is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">District Attorney Richard A. Brown said only that the grand jury had reached a decision and it would be announced Monday. He gave no reason for the delay, but indictments are often kept sealed until attorneys and their clients are notified and arrangements can be made for the defendants to surrender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A person familiar with the case told the AP that the other two officers in the shooting - one black and one white - were not charged. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the grand jury's decision has not been made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case also brought back painful memories of other infamous police shootings in New York City, including the 1999 killing of unarmed African immigrant Amadou Diallo, who died in a hail of 41 bullets. The officers in that case were acquitted of criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police union officials defended the officers, arguing they were responding to reasonable suspicions the victims were armed and dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This indictment sends a chilling message to all New York City police officers and to all law enforcement throughout the country,&quot; said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association. &quot;You can act in good faith and there is no margin for error.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora, 28, was &quot;very upset,&quot; attorney Philip Karasyk said. &quot;But he is confident that once he has his day in court he will be vindicated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury's decision came after three days of deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anticipation has been running high around New York City about the grand jury's decision. Extra police officers were put on standby, and the mayor met with black leaders in the Queens neighborhood where the shooting occurred in hopes of defusing any tensions that might arise from the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever the grand jury says ... I think you will see the people of this city behaving in an exemplary manner,&quot; Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Friday.</SPAN></P>
