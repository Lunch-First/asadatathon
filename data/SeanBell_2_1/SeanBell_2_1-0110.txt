At the heart of a grand jury's decision yesterday to indict three police officers in the shooting death of 
 is the state penal code's wording on the use of deadly force.   
"The use of deadly physical force is necessary to defend the police officer or peace officer or another person from what the officer reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force," the penal code says.  
Cops who fired 50 shots at Bell's car Nov. 25 said they unloaded after the driver tried to run them over and after one cop saw a passenger reach for something in his waistband.  
Bell and two friends wounded in the shooting were unarmed.  
Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said it is against department policy to fire at a car being used as a weapon. Kelly also said cops are taught not to fire more than three shots at a time without pausing to assess the situation.  
In the last 13 years, three NYPD cops have been convicted of criminal charges for shooting in the line of duty.  
In a case of "friendly fire," Officer Peter DelDebbio, who is white, mistakenly shot black undercover Officer Desmond Robinson four times in the back on Aug. 22, 1994, on a subway platform. He was convicted of second-degree assault.  
Officer Paolo Colecchia, 45, was convicted of second-degree manslaughter in a non-jury trial for the July 4, 1996, shooting death of an unarmed man in a Bronx subway station.  
Former Officer Bryan Conroy was convicted of criminally negligent homicide in connection with the May 22, 2003, shooting death of a West African immigrant inside a Chelsea storage warehouse.
