<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THE WEE hours of Nov. 25, two days after Thanksgiving, the Kalua Cabaret club was jammed with men appreciating the performances of several strippers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who would be dead before the sun rose, killed in a fusillade of 50 police bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When three of the cops involved in the fatal shooting were indicted Friday, the Kalua Cabaret was like a morgue. Only a handful of customers were around the dimly lit bar, sipping drinks and watching a stripper go through her paces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the grand jury's decision elicited strong emotions. &quot;It's a start. Now let's investigate the whole precinct,&quot; said a bar manager, who described himself as a friend of Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cop who emptied his gun and reloaded should do time for all of them. Bottom line,&quot; a balding bouncer said, referring to Detective Michael Oliver, who fired 31 of the 50 shots and was hit with manslaughter charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A maintenance man who lives nearby said, &quot;Now, the cops will know they can't just roll on us. There are consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others seemed not to care. Asked what she thought, a stripper with smudged eyeliner flashed her G-string and replied, &quot;Oh, I don't know about that. But you're beautiful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
