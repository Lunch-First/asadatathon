<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STEM CELL BAN HOBBLES SCIENCE, NIH CHIEF SAYS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Lifting the ban on taxpayer funding of research on new stem cells from fertilized embryos would better serve both science and the nation, the chief of the National Institutes of Health told lawmakers Monday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the justices conclude Joseph Frederick's homemade sign was a pro-drug message, they are likely to side with principal Deborah Morse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the court could rule for Frederick if it determines that he was, as he has contended, conducting a free-speech experiment using a nonsensical message that contained no pitch for drug use.</SPAN></P>
