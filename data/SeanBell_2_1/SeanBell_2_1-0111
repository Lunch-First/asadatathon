<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three NYPD cops were indicted yesterday for firing 46 of 50 shots at three unarmed men in a car on a Queens street last year - wounding two and killing a groom just hours before his wedding.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three anxious days of deliberations, a Queens grand jury reached its decision against three of the five officers involved in the shooting, which sparked charges of police brutality and set back relations between the police and the black community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although District Attorney Richard Brown said the grand jury's decision was sealed and would not be announced until Monday, sources and a lawyer for one of the indicted officers confirmed that the charges had been handed up.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives Michael Oliver, Marc Cooper and Gescard Isnora were indicted, according to lawyers for each of the cops.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges against them were not immediately clear. The possibilities, according to the DA's office, included attempted murder, manslaughter and reckless endangerment, all felonies.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel included eight blacks, seven whites, and a mix of Hispanics and Asians.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can indict a ham sandwich or even a rock in the grand jury,&quot; said Michael Palladino, the president of the Detectives Endowment Association.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper, who fired four shots at Bell's car Nov. 25, was at home with his wife and family when he heard the news from his lawyer, Paul Martin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He believes he acted responsibly and professionally,&quot; Martin said. &quot;I did not think my client had any criminal responsibility.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said Isnora, who blew his cover to confront Bell and his friends after a bachelor party at a Jamaica strip club, fired 11 shots.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver reportedly unloaded 31 shots, including some after he had reloaded.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're both very disappointed,&quot; said Oliver's lawyer, James Culleton. &quot;It's a tragedy for everyone.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just the beginning of the process,&quot; said Isnora's lawyer, Philip Karasyk. &quot;It's one thing to be in a warm room asking questions and not making split-second decisions on the street.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, a spokesman for Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre-Bell, was measured in his response, saying he'd wait until Monday's announcement to give a detailed press conference.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was joined by Trent Benefield, 23, and Joseph Guzman, 31, who were seriously wounded during the shooting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Charges are not convictions,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;And convictions, even then, cannot bring back </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and cannot repair the damage to Joe and Trent.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton even invoked the memories of two auxiliary police officers who were shot to death on a Greenwich Village street Wednesday night.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the ugliest things that occurred was the killings of these auxiliary police officers,&quot; Sharpton said at his Harlem headquarters. &quot;But it is just as ugly for the police to break the law and shoot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield's mother, Denise Ford, said she'll be happier if the indictments turn into convictions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to leave it God's hands,&quot; she said, adding that she's &quot;hoping for&quot; justice.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 23-member panel deliberated for three days before reaching its decision. One of those days was interrupted by last-minute testimony from a janitor, who, according to sources, claimed to have seen a &quot;fourth man&quot; shoot at the cops and flee.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although detectives thought the testimony would help the officers' case, it didn't. The three indicted cops will face trial on charges that could, if they're convicted of the top counts, put them behind bars for a minimum of seven years each.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other officers, Michael Carey and Paul Headley, were not charged. Headley fired one shot. Carey fired three.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My client feels relieved and vindicated,&quot; said Stephen Worth, Carey's lawyer.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department brass said the status of the five officers involved remains unchanged until Monday's official announcement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is expected that the three officers indicted will turn over their badges and guns. The two officers who were not indicted could conceivably be restored to duty, sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD has marshaled extra forces to contend with any fallout from the announcements. Mayor Bloomberg said the mobilization was just a precaution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever the grand jury says . . . I think you will see the people of this city behaving in an exemplary manner,&quot; Bloomberg said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can be disappointed; they can express themselves . . . But nobody is going to go out and make our streets unsafe.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anger was beginning to boil among black leaders after the surprise witness resurrected the cop-friendly &quot;fourth man&quot; theory. But early reaction to the indictments in the city's black communities was mixed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a step,&quot; said Ben Wolf, 38, a resident of the Baisley Park Gardens apartments, where Benefield lives, and where a makeshift memorial to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> still stands.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad it's going down like this. We need justice. Now my kids can be safe,&quot; Wolf said. &quot;Responsibility is very important. I teach my kids about responsibility and justice, that you can't just do something and get away with it.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other's felt the indictments didn't go far enough.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody should have gotten indicted,&quot; said Felix Ebron, 49, a Harlem photographer. &quot;It wasn't just three officers who did the shooting. I'm outraged. If it happened to him, it can also happen to me.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officers throughout the city had anxiously awaited the decision. Many were disappointed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I respect their decision but firmly disagree,&quot; Palladino said. &quot;I don't think the actions of the detectives rise to a criminal level. The message will have a chilling effect not only here but throughout the country.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One veteran officer said the charges would make police officers hesitant in dangerous situations, a delay that could cost some their lives.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a tragic state of affairs, considering they're not even paying these guys decent money to start,&quot; said the officer, a supervisor.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, and his friends were on their way home from a bachelor party at a strip club in South Jamaica where an undercover cop reportedly saw someone with a gun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, an officer reportedly heard Guzman say, &quot;Yo, get my gun,&quot; during an argument between Bell's party and a man outside the club. The cop called for backup, approached the friends' car, and began to unload when Bell, who was driving, began to pull away.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One officer said he saw a passenger reach for something in his waistband. No weapons were found.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman took 16 of the 50 bullets, which left 19 holes in his body.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't even have a pair of scissors in the car,&quot; Guzman said after he was released from the hospital.  </SPAN></P>
