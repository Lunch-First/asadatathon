<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN open letter to Mayor Bloomberg:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Mr. Mayor, I believe you are a great mayor - apart from the fact that you want cops and firefighters to live on all the free water they can drink.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's incendiary and cancerous assaults on cops, even unarmed auxiliaries, surely hurts both our souls.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops are getting shot, stabbed and mauled all over the city - and now we're looking to put them away over the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tragedy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was certainly reasonable for a grand jury to meet over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was killed the night before he was going to get married.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Mr. Mayor, somehow, someway, you, I and the cops who were there all know that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> death was a cataclysmic case of the wrong guy in the wrong place. It wasn't murder - nor was it manslaughter.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of the horrific shooting, you set the tone with a knee-jerk remark that the force used by the cops was &quot;excessive&quot; - and now we have three indictments.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Patten, the lead attorney for the four cops charged but acquitted in the sad death of Amadou Diallo, told me the other day: &quot;The number of shots fired has nothing to do with a case. Those cops believed the shots being fired were a risk to their lives or their colleagues' lives.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Number of shots means nothing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> didn't deserve to die.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Mr. Mayor - with great respect - the very same cops that the city pays below the poverty level shouldn't be exposed to doing prison time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeah, you're a great mayor, but I'm glad I'm not a cop or a firefighter.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike, make it right. </SPAN></P>
