Lawyers for the cops indicted in the 

 shooting are likely to ask for - but unlikely to win - a change of venue.   
That's the opinion of lawyers who represented the four cops acquitted in the killing of Amadou Diallo in a hail of 41 bullets in 1999.  
Experts said that's partly because the system is inherently skewed against venue changes and also because the case will likely be heard months from now, during which time publicity about it will likely subside.  
Steven Brounstein, who represented Officer Kenneth Boss in Diallo's death, said, "Right now, I think there's a lot of negative publicity. I'd ask for a change of venue right now." But asked if he thought he would be successful, he replied, "I wouldn't bet on that one."  
John Patten, who represented Officer Sean Carroll in the shooting, agreed.  
Legal experts said getting a change of venue in the Bell case would be difficult also because it occurred in Queens, where such a motion is possible only after there has been an attempt to pick a jury.  
The Diallo shooting, in The Bronx, fell in a judicial district that allows change-of-venue motions to be made at any time. That trial was moved to Albany.
