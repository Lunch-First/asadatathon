Two New York City police detectives were charged with first-degree manslaughter in the death of 
 an unarmed man who died in a burst of 50 police bullets, a local district attorney, Richard Brown, said at a news conference Monday. 
The charge carries a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison. The two were also charged with second-degree manslaughter; a judge has discretion under a conviction for that charge to issue a sentence of probation.
The two detectives charged with manslaughter were Michael Oliver, who fired his pistol 31 times, and Gerard Isnora, an undercover officer, who fired 11 shots. A third detective, Marc Cooper, who fired four shots, faces two counts of reckless endangerment. All three pleaded not guilty.
