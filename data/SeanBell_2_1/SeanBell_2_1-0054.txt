NEW YORK: Two New York police officers involved in the shooting death of an unarmed black man hours before he was to marry have been charged with manslaughter.
The two were among five officers involved in the shooting of 
 23, gunned down in a hail of bullets last year as he was leaving a nightclub in the borough of Queens in November.
He had been due to get married hours later.
The two undercover detectives, Gescard Isnora, who is black, and Michael Oliver, who is white, were charged with both intentional and reckless manslaughter and face up to 25 years in jail if convicted.
