<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT WOULD STILL be some time before the three officers indicted in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> police shooting would be arraigned in court, but the Rev. Al Sharpton wasn't wasting any time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not cooperate or testify in a trial outside of Queens County,&quot; he thundered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton threatened to keep the two surviving victims in the police shooting - Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield - from testifying if the trial were moved from Queens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't clear if Sharpton's threat would carry any weight - or even if it's a valid threat, since no lawyer involved in the case has asked for a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But defense lawyers have said they would consider the option, and there are those, including union officials representing the detectives, who believe that negative press coverage could prejudice a potential jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changes of venue are extremely rare and are decided by a panel of Appellate Division judges, not the trial judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many high-profile defendants whose cases have attracted intense coverage in the media have been tried in the county where their crimes occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the people of Queens could be fair,&quot; said Kenneth Thompson, the former Brooklyn federal prosecutor who led the team that tried cops accused of assaulting Abner Louima with a plunger in a Brooklyn precinct stationhouse in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Louima case, there were 8,000 people who marched over the Brooklyn Bridge, some holding plungers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, uncooperative witnesses could pose serious problems for Queens prosecutors and force witness-stand showdowns. Reluctant witnesses could be subpoenaed, and those who didn't comply could be jailed for contempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could be a nightmare,&quot; said Thompson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said he will try the three detectives in Queens. &quot;The jury should be representative of the diversity of this county,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the defense lawyers, James Culleton, represented an officer in the Amadou Diallo case, which was moved from the Bronx to Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo, a West African immigrant, was slain by 19 of 41 shots fired by Bronx undercover cops in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Sharpton and other critics of the Diallo outcome, defense attorneys correctly predicted that an Albany jury would be more cop-friendly than one in the Bronx. But attorney Steven Brounstein, who represented acquitted Officer Kenneth Boss, bristles at the suggestion the defense was trying to get an edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were looking for a fair shot,&quot; said Brounstein. &quot;You want people who can go back to their community and not have to worry when you're dealing with a tremendous amount of pretrial publicity that can affect jurors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The formal indictment had one surprise element with legal ramifications for the upcoming trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Detectives Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora were hit with first- and second-degree manslaughter charges - rather than just second-degree - means they face mandatory prison time if convicted of the top count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had the top count been second-degree manslaughter, the accused cops could feel secure in risking a trial and a guilty verdict - and still perhaps avoid any time behind bars, legal experts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the prospect of mandatory prison time hanging over them, there could be impetus for a possible plea deal - even though neither side has indicated they would consider one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if any [plea] offers were made by the attorneys,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if the defense attorneys request a plea deal, Sharpton would advise against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We certainly would hope that they will not entertain in any way, shape or form a plea bargain in this case,&quot; he said. &quot;This case should be brought to trial, and there ought to be a maximum prosecution and, we hope, conviction.&quot; tzambito@nydailynews.com</SPAN></P>
