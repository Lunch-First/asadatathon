<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE QUEENS judge chosen to preside over the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> police shooting case has a history of slamming cop haters, including one involved in a recent controversial case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman, who gets the case April 11 after his name was plucked randomly out of a drum yesterday, jailed a man who bit a cop, even though imprisonment wasn't mandatory in the 2004 case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also handed down a sentence of 52 years to life in 1990 to Jay Harrison, convicted of murdering two detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the judge is most hailed by police for his role in jailing William Hodges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accused of shooting a police officer, Hodges became a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre for cops in 2002 after Queens Supreme Court Justice Laura Blackburne freed him on a technicality. Blackburne was eventually thrown off the bench for helping a different suspect escape a detective trying to arrest him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hodges' luck seemed to hold when he escaped an assault rap and was convicted only of a minor charge - but Cooperman sentenced him to the maximum year in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Cooperman, who served 10 years in the Assembly and was first elected to the Supreme Court in 1982, was described by one lawyer as a &quot;straight shooter&quot; well-qualified for a controversial case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's highly intelligent and can handle the job,&quot; said the insider, noting that Cooperman has also sentenced police convicted of attacking civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1986, Cooperman sentenced two ex-cops to two-to-six years in prison for torturing a teenage drug suspect with a stun gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crime was &quot;an affront to the honest and honorable police officers who carry out their sworn duties in conformance with the law,&quot; he was quoted as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the best things the 73-year-old jurist may have going for him is his age, said another court insider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His career is mostly behind him,&quot; he said, noting that an older judge is less likely to be affected by the highly charged politics of the case.</SPAN></P>
