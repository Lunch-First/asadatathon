THE INDICTMENT of three cops in the 
 shooting may have eased tensions, but it didn't temper strong opinions about the case. 
Messages posted on the Daily News Web site show a deep division between those who applaud the charges and those who are outraged the detectives will face trial.
"I realize why I moved from the Big Apple to Maine," said one reader. "Police are respected, not reviled, here for doing their jobs."
"These cops were in a situation none of us could ever understand," another reader added.
But others were unsympathetic to the indicted cops.
"The police do need to do their job, but sometimes it is painfully obvious that they overreact," said one posting. "We want the police to protect us, but to be sensible about the way they use their weapons."
