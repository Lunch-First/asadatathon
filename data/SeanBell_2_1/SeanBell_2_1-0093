<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An undercover detective was indicted by a grand jury for manslaughter not because he fired the shot that killed groom </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but because he fired the first shot, The Post has learned.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Queens grand jury agreed with the prosecution's argument that Detective Gescard Isnora should be charged with manslaughter because he was the first of the five cops to fire outside a Queens strip joint on Nov. 25, a court source said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By shooting at Bell and pals Trent Benefield, 23, and Joseph Guzman, 31, prosecutors say, Isnora created the situation that caused another officer, Michael Oliver, also charged with manslaughter, to open fire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The source said prosecutors hoped to prove that Isnora's recklessness created a situation that caused &quot;unjustifiable risk of death&quot; and &quot;created the grave cause of the death.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is one standard for manslaughter.     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another officer, Marc Cooper, was indicted for reckless endangerment.     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges </SPAN></P>
