<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT WAS A &quot;SLAP IN THE FACE&quot; for the cop accused of firing 31 shots at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to party at an East Side hot spot just a day after he was indicted in the fatal shooting, Bell's pastor said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Michael Oliver shocked even his supporters when he dined on $180 pasta with truffles and $575 bottles of wine at celebrity hangout Nello's on Saturday night - racking up a $4,200 bill. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Him going out and celebrating and having a party, [he's saying], 'Hey, there's nothing to this,' &quot; said the Rev. Lester Williams of Community Baptist Church of Christ in Jamaica, Queens, where Bell was supposed to get married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a slap in the face to us,&quot; Williams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, 35, will be arraigned today on manslaughter charges along with Detective Gescard Isnora, 28, in the killing of Bell outside a Queens strip club on Nov. 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Marc Cooper, 39, faces reckless endangerment charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives of the victims blasted Oliver for going out for a night on the town with a friend from Spain and two beauties so soon after a grand jury charged him on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't really know what he was celebrating,&quot; said Denise Ford, whose son Trent Benefield, 23, was shot and wounded alongside Bell, 23, and a third friend, Joseph Guzman, 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a young man under the ground,&quot; said Les Paultre, whose daughter Nicole would have married Bell. &quot;I'd think you'd like to show some kind of respect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police insiders say Oliver showed incredibly bad judgment by indulging in $65 Dover sole at a high-profile restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He just got himself convicted,&quot; said one police union official. &quot;We have to rein him in before he gets the other guys convicted, too. It's all about perception.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His lawyer will sit him down and talk to him,&quot; added another police source. &quot;I guarantee this won't happen again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party-boy image may not directly affect the cops' case, but public perception can sway high-profile jury trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even supporters of the accused cops say the three have been warned to avoid appearing to thumb their noses at the victim and the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the accused cops asked whether they could attend the St. Patrick's Day Parade - and were told to stay out of the public eye, sources said. &quot;This has come up before,&quot; a police union insider said. &quot;He and the others have been told to lay low.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton said Oliver's taste for fine wine raises a legitimate question about whether cops were drinking the night of the Bell shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most striking thing is the amount of alcohol,&quot; said Sharpton, pointing to reports of the dinner that had four people downing five bottles of wine. &quot;How much alcohol was consumed on the night </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But detectives union chief Michael Palladino hit back at Sharpton, saying he has a &quot;warped mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver was not inside the strip club and has not been accused of drinking that night, Palladino said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also suggested that Mayor Bloomberg's comments after the shooting that the 50 shots &quot;sounds like excessive force&quot; could provide legal grounds to move the trial out of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will examine all of our options, including a change of venue,&quot; he told WABC/Channel 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palladino also took a subtle shot at Bell and two buddies, who faced off with cops as they came out of the Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica, a notorious strip joint. &quot;There is a distinct difference between going to dinner with friends and partying in a dump called the club Kalua, which is overrun with drugs, guns and prostitution,&quot; Palladino told the Daily News.</SPAN></P>
