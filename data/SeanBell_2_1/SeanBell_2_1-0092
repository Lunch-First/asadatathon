<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An undercover detective was indicted by a grand jury for manslaughter not because he fired the shot that killed groom </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but because he fired the first shot, The Post has learned.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Queens grand jury agreed with the prosecution's argument that Detective Gescard Isnora should be charged with manslaughter because he was the first of the five cops to open fire outside a Queens strip joint Nov. 25, a court source said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By shooting at Bell and pals Trent Benefield, 23, and Joseph Guzman, 31, prosecutors say, Isnora created the situation that caused another officer, Michael Oliver, to open fire.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only Oliver -  who shot off 31 of the 50 bullets fired by the five cops that tragic day -  has been linked to a slug found during Bell's autopsy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The source said prosecutors hoped to prove that Isnora's recklessness created a situation that caused &quot;unjustifiable risk of death&quot; and &quot;created the grave cause of the death.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is one standard for manslaughter.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the indictments' remaining sealed until tomorrow, several sources have confirmed that both Isnora and Oliver were indicted for manslaughter.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another officer, Marc Cooper, was indicted for reckless endangerment, which could be a felony or misdemeanor charge.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other officers who fired their weapons that night do not face charges.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver angrily threatened a Post reporter who asked him a question yesterday about his indictment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Step one foot, and it's 'Game over!' &quot; yelled Oliver as he shoveled snow outside his family home in Clifton, N.J. &quot;I'm gonna ask you nicely. I have no comment. Please leave, OK?&quot;      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post also learned that the stray bullet that shattered a window on a nearby AirTrain elevated platform in Queens was fired by Cooper.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the four bullets Cooper fired hit Bell, Benefield or Guzman, according to Cooper's lawyer.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Paul Martin said Cooper, a father of four with 17 years on the job, told the grand jury that he heard cars crashing and a barrage of gunfire before he ducked to the ground and opened fire.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Court sources said his bullet was the one captured on a dramatic video that showed a slug landing just inches from two Port Authority cops standing on the AirTrain platform. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*  Detective Michael Oliver, 35 -  Manslaughter Fired 31 shots, including bullet that killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*  Detective Marc Cooper, 39 - Reckless endangerment. Shot four bullets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*  Detective Gescard Isnora, 28 - Manslaughter, Fired 11 times, including the first shot on the scene </SPAN></P>
