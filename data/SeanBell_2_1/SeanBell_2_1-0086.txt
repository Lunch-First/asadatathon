TWO New York police officers face manslaughter charges and another faces a misdemeanour reckless endangerment charge over a 50-bullet barrage that killed an unarmed black man on his wedding day. 
A grand jury handed down the indictments against the three police officers - Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper - after meeting for more than three months, during which they analysed hundreds of pieces of evidence, from hospital records to videotapes and toxicology reports.
But the explosive case is just getting started, lawyers said yesterday. The indictment is the first step in a process that will drag on for months.
 23, was shot on November 25 while leaving a bachelor party at a Queens nightclub.
Bell was being followed by plainclothes police detectives who thought someone in his party had a gun. Five officers opened fire after one undercover policeman thought he glimpsed a weapon.
Bell died and two of his friends, Trent Benefield, 23, and Joseph Guzman, 31, were wounded.
