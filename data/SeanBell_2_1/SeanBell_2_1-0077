<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two cops who fired 42 of 50 shots at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could face more than half a century behind bars after their indictment yesterday in the death of the unarmed groom.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third could escape prison entirely.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Detectives Michael Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Gescard Isnora, who got off 11 bullets, pleaded not guilty to a slew of charges, including first- and second-degree manslaughter. The harsher charge carries a maximum penalty of 25 years behind bars.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indicted cops came face to face with Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, who were wounded in the Nov. 25 shooting in Queens.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third detective, Marc Cooper, charged with reckless endangerment, also pleaded not guilty at the arraignment at Queens Supreme Court.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton said the charges weren't enough.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There clearly was evidence to reach the charges of murder and attempted murder,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton, intending to say all five cops involved in the shooting should have been charged, said instead, &quot;Clearly, all five officers should have been shot.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He corrected himself, repeating &quot;charged&quot; several times.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, was killed and pals Benefield, 23, and Guzman, 31, were wounded in a barrage of police bullets as they sat in a car after leaving Kalua Cabaret, a strip club.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three had been attending a bachelor party for Bell, who was to be married later that day.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An eight-count indictment, handed down Friday and unsealed yesterday also accused Oliver, 35, of two counts of first-degree assault and two count of reckless endangerment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If convicted of all charges, he faces 15 to 75 years behind bars, said a spokeswoman for the Queens District Attorney's Office.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charges against Isnora, 28, include first- and second-degree assault as well as reckless endangerment. He faces 12 to 57 years in prison if convicted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper, 39, who fired four times, was charged with reckless endangerment after one of his bullets went through a window of an occupied AirTrain station across the street from the club. He faces up to a year in prison and/or a $1,000 fine.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe this office and this grand jury got the results that were most appropriate,&quot; Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said in unsealing the indictment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Michael Carey, who fired three shots, and Officer Paul Headley, who fired one, weren't charged.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Oliver, Isnora and Cooper were suspended without pay, while Carey and Headley were place on modified duty.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their supervisor that night, Lt. Gary Napoli - who hid behind a car when the gunfire erupted - was also placed on modified duty.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the unsealing of the indictment, the NYPD began an internal probe of the shooting. &quot;Recognizing that the shooting death of an unarmed individual by police has exacerbated relations in the minority community, the Police Department will redouble its efforts to build the best possible relations with all of New York City's diverse communities,&quot; Kelly said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's parents, William and Valerie Bell, sat in the third row of the courtroom. Valerie Bell wore a button with a picture of her son.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the arraignment, the mother bowed her head, closed her eyes and pressed her hands together as if she were praying.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicole Paultre Bell, who was engaged to Bell and legally took his name after he died, sat in the fourth row.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman, in a wheelchair, and Benefield, using a crutch, also were in the courtroom. At one point, Guzman wheeled himself closer to get a better look at Oliver and then shook his head.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the indictment was read, Valerie Bell began to cry.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three cops, wearing dark suits, stood expressionless.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Randall Eng asked how each defendant was pleading. Lawyer James Culleton, who represents Oliver, said, &quot;Not-guilty plea to all charges.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora's lawyer, Philip Karasyk, &quot;Not guilty of each and every count of the indictment.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyer Paul Martin, who represents Cooper, said, &quot;The defendant pleads not guilty to each count of the indictment.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eng set bail for Oliver and Isnora at $250,000 bond, or $100,000 cash each, which was posted by the Detectives Endowment Association. Cooper was released without bail.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse, Paultre Bell said, &quot;Today is just a baby step in the long road that we have ahead of us.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman stood from his wheelchair to reach the microphone.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, we got an indictment. Round One. We've got a hard road to go,&quot; he said. &quot;This was not a victory. It's hollow - that's all it is.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing the indictment, DA Brown said he would oppose any change-of-venue attempts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe that you could find a jury that would be more impartial, thorough or fair than you'd find here in Queens County,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked if he would consider a plea bargain, Brown said, &quot;I don't know if any offers were made by the attorneys.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton, speaking at his Harlem headquarters, adamantly opposed a plea bargain. &quot;We certainly would hope that they will not entertain in any way, shape or form a plea bargain in this case,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flanked by Paultre Bell, Guzman and Benefield, the civil-rights leader said he was equally opposed to a change of venue being sought by advocates for the cops.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question of venue change is not only wrong but insulting the intelligence of the public and the intelligence of the court,&quot; he said. &quot;We will not participate in or cooperate with a trial outside of Queens County.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case at its best is a return to grief for all of those involved. This is not a cause for joy, celebration or revenge,&quot; Sharpton added.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paultre Bell broke down and sobbed as she watched Brown announce the charges on TV.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of protesters lined the sidewalk in front of the courthouse. Some carried signs. Others wore clothing with sayings referring to the 50 shots that killed Bell.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters included city Councilman Charles Barron (D-Brooklyn), who called for a special prosecutor to push for punishment for all five cops. &quot;This job is incomplete,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three protesters were arrested for sitting on the courthouse steps.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference after the arraignment, Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association, condemned the charges against the cops.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a very dark day for the detectives and the NYPD,&quot; he said. &quot;The message that's being sent by these charges is more chilling than I originally thought. I don't know how law-enforcement officers throughout this country can now go to work in confidence.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
