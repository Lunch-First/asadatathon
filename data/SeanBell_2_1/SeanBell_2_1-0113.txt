AN open letter to Mayor Bloomberg:  
Dear Mr. Mayor, I believe you are a great mayor - apart from the fact that you want cops and firefighters to live on all the free water they can drink.   
This week's incendiary and cancerous assaults on cops, even unarmed auxiliaries, surely hurts both our souls.  
Cops are getting shot, stabbed and mauled all over the city - and now we're looking to put them away over the 

 tragedy.  
It was certainly reasonable for a grand jury to meet over 

 who was killed the night before he was going to get married.  
But, Mr. Mayor, somehow, someway, you, I and the cops who were there all know that 

 death was a cataclysmic case of the wrong guy in the wrong place. It wasn't murder - nor was it manslaughter.  
In the aftermath of the horrific shooting, you set the tone with a knee-jerk remark that the force used by the cops was "excessive" - and now we have three indictments.  
John Patten, the lead attorney for the four cops charged but acquitted in the sad death of Amadou Diallo, told me the other day: "The number of shots fired has nothing to do with a case. Those cops believed the shots being fired were a risk to their lives or their colleagues' lives."  
Number of shots means nothing.  

 didn't deserve to die.  
But, Mr. Mayor - with great respect - the very same cops that the city pays below the poverty level shouldn't be exposed to doing prison time.  
Yeah, you're a great mayor, but I'm glad I'm not a cop or a firefighter.  
Mike, make it right.
