<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day his honeymoon was to have started, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> memory and the manner of his death - shot many times by New York police - dominated the latest outcry against city officers' use of deadly force against an unarmed black man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred people held a vigil for Mr Bell on Sunday, some shouting &quot;No justice, no peace&quot; and demanding the sacking of New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many counted off to 50, the number of rounds estimated to have been fired by police at Mr Bell, 23, and two other unarmed men in a car early on Saturday - hours before he was to have married the mother of his two children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five officers were placed on paid administrative leave and stripped of their guns, said chief spokesman Paul Browne for the New York Police Department. Police and prosecutors promised a full investigation, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Commissioner Kelly were planning to meet with community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of that stemmed the fury of a community outraged by the shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot allow this to continue to happen,&quot; the Rev Al Sharpton, a prominent civil rights leader, said at the gathering outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where one of the two wounded men was in critical condition..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kelly has said that police shot at the car after it drove forward and struck an undercover officer and an unmarked police minivan. The information was based on interviews with witnesses and two officers who did not fire their weapons, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shootings occurred after 4am on Saturday outside the Kalua Cabaret in the borough of Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kelly said the confrontation stemmed from an undercover operation by seven officers investigating the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell was struck twice. Joseph Guzman, 31, was shot at least 11 times, and Trent Benefield, 23, was hit three times. Mr Guzman was in critical condition yesterday and Mr Benefield was said to be stable.</SPAN></P>
