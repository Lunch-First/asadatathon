It was an odd moment in the aftermath of the police shooting of 
 the Rev. Al Sharpton posing with Mayor Bloomberg before TV cameras at a City Hall press conference but then bolting before the first word was uttered.   
Bloomberg explained Sharpton's hasty departure Monday by saying the reverend had to rush to a meeting with the victim's family.  
In fact, Sharpton hadn't wanted to attend the press conference at all - but was persuaded by the mayor to put in a brief appearance, sources said.  
With Sharpton at his side, Bloomberg could demonstrate that he had reached out to the most fiery critic of the NYPD.       
But by leaving early, Sharpton avoided putting himself in an awkward situation where he might have to publicly disagree with the mayor, whom some had expected to defend the police.  
Before the press conference, Sharpton attended a meeting set up by the mayor with community and elected officials.  
One participant said Sharpton "turned to [Police Commissioner Ray] Kelly and said, 'I've got good news and bad news. The good news is, I still support you being commissioner. The bad news is, most commissioners I support end up getting fired.' "  
At that point, state Sen. Malcolm Smith declared that it was up to everyone to maintain peace in the community.  
Sharpton responded by saying: "You invited me into your house. I'm not going to kick the chandelier."  
It was Sharpton, representing the Bell family, who first reached out to the administration Saturday - not the other way around, say insiders.  
"Rev. Sharpton has played an excellent role in this process," Deputy Mayor Dennis Walcott told The Post.
