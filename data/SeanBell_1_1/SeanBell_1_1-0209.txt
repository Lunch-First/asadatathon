A crowd angrily called on police today to explain why authorities shot dead a 23-year-old man on the day of his wedding in New York, and some called for the sacking of the city's police commissioner. 
They want to know why officers fired as many as 50 shots at an unarmed group of three yesterday as they left 
 bachelor party in a car.
''We cannot allow this to continue to happen,'' African-American community leader the Rev Al Sharpton said.
The civil rights advocate led the crowd in chants of ''No justice, no peace''.
Commissioner Ray Kelly said the department was still piecing together what happened.
The officers' shots struck the men's car 21 times after the vehicle rammed into an undercover officer and hit an unmarked NYPD minivan.
The wild gunfire hit nearby homes and shattered windows at a train station, though no residents were injured.
Police thought one of the men might have had a gun. But investigators found no weapons.
Kelly said the incident stemmed from an undercover operation inside a strip club in the Jamaica section of Queens.
According to Kelly, the groom was involved in a verbal dispute outside the club after 4am and one of his friends made a reference to a gun.
The surviving victims were Joseph Guzman, 31, who was shot at least 11 times, and Trent Benefield, 23, who was hit three times.
