NEW YORK: Mayor Michael Bloomberg has weighed in on the uproar over a police shooting, saying officers appeared to use ''excessive force'' when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man outside a strip club hours before his wedding. 
''It is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what happened,'' the New York City mayor said yesterday.
He had just met with elected officials and community leaders including the Reverend Al Sharpton, a black civil rights leader.
The groom, 
 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early on Saturday after a bachelor party at the strip club.
Suspecting that one of the men had a gun, police fired 50 rounds into the vehicle. The men were unarmed.
In her first public comments on the shooting, Mr Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre, told a radio station that the people who shot her husband should not be called officers.
''They were murderers, murderers,'' she told hip-hop station Power 105.1. ''They were not officers. No one gives anyone the right to kill somebody.''
Mr Sharpton called the conference a ''very candid'' meeting.
He said the message to Mr Bloomberg was: ''This city must show moral outrage that 50 shots were fired on three unarmed men.''
Some have questioned if the shooting was racially motivated because the victims were black men.
The five officers who fired their guns included two blacks, two whites and one Hispanic.
Former mayor Rudy Giuliani was hounded for what some viewed as a slow response to the killing of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who was shot 19 times, in the Bronx, by four white officers.
All four were acquitted of criminal charges.
The gunfire in the current case stemmed from an undercover operation inside the strip club.
