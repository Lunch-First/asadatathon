MAYOR Bloomberg said yesterday he'll honor the wishes of 
 relatives and not attend tonight's funeral for the 23-year-old groom who was killed last Saturday by police bullets. 
"I talked to their minister yesterday and decided that I'm not going to go to the funeral," Bloomberg said. "I've expressed myself and my sympathies on behalf of the city to the family."
But Deputy Mayor Dennis Walcott, who lives in Bell's neighborhood and is black, will attend the funeral at 7 p.m. at Community Church of Christ in Jamaica.
Bishop Lester Williams, the church pastor, confirmed the family asked Bloomberg to stay away.
"The mayor is doing the right thing and respecting their wishes that this not be turned into a media frenzy," Williams said.
Bloomberg met privately Tuesday at Williams' church with Bell's parents, William and Valerie, and his fiance, Nicole Paultre. Bell and Paultre were supposed to get married the day he was killed and his two friends were wounded by police outside a seedy strip club.
Plainclothes and undercover cops fired 50 bullets at the unarmed men after Bell twice rammed his car into an unmarked police van.
Bloomberg has characterized the number of shots fired as "excessive," which has angered some police advocates.
At the same time, black community leaders have bristled at Bloomberg's unwillingness to outright condemn the police involved in the shooting.
