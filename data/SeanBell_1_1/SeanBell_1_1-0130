<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor meets with family of victim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael Bloomberg met Tuesday with the family of the man who was killed on his wedding day in a barrage of police gunfire as he left his bachelor party, and investigators questioned a third civilian witness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days after the fatal encounter, it remained unclear why four detectives and one police officer opened fire while conducting an undercover operation at a strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unidentified third witness was on a darkened block in Queens when five police officers killed 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and injured two friends as the three sat inside a car, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Bloomberg went to the Bell family's Queens church, where he met with the parents and fiancee of the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor stood by his comments Tuesday that officers appeared to use &quot;excessive force&quot; when Bell was killed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woman arrested, may have microwaved baby</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mother was arrested on suspicion of murdering her newborn daughter by microwaving the baby in an oven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China Arnold, 26, was jailed Monday on a charge of aggravated murder, more than a year after she brought her dead month-old baby to a hospital. Bail was set Tuesday at $1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have reason to believe, and we have some forensic evidence that is consistent with our belief, that a microwave oven was used in this death,&quot; said Ken Betz, director of the Montgomery County coroner's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the evidence included high-heat internal injuries and the absence of external burn marks on the baby, Paris Talley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arnold was arrested soon after the baby's death in August 2005, then was released while authorities investigated further. Betz said the case was difficult because &quot;there is not a lot of scientific research and data on the effect of microwaves on human beings.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Man dies month after a $1.1 million award</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man who successfully sued a television station for naming him as a suspect in the BTK serial killings has died, a month after a jury awarded him $1.1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Valadez, 66, apparently suffered a heart attack Monday evening at his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his death, the defamation verdict may be thrown out. Under Kansas law, decisions in libel cases do not survive the plaintiff's death, media attorney Mike Merriam said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, a jury found that Emmis Communications, owner at the time of KSNW-TV in Wichita, and news director Todd Spessard defamed Valadez for the coverage of his arrest on Dec. 1, 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Valadez was never charged with the killings. Dennis Rader eventually confessed to all 10 killings from 1974 to 1991.</SPAN></P>
