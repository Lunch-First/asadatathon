Hundreds of angry protesters shouted "No justice, no peace!" in New York on Sunday, demanding to know why police officers had killed an unarmed black man on the day of his wedding. 
Some people at the vigil and rally called for the sacking of New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and many counted up to 50 - the number of rounds that are estimated to have been fired by police at three unarmed men in a car.
The bullets killed 23-year-old 
 early on Saturday, hours before he was supposed to marry the mother of his two young children. His two friends were wounded.
The five officers have been placed on paid administrative leave and stripped of their guns, said New York Police Department chief spokesman Paul Browne. Police and prosecutors pledged a full inquiry.
But, at the rally outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where one of the two wounded men remains in a critical condition, prominent civil rights leader Al Sharpton insisted: "We cannot allow this to continue to happen.
"We've got to understand that all of us were in that car."
Mr Kelly says that police shot at the car after it drove forward and hit an undercover officer and an unmarked police minivan.
The information was based on interviews with witnesses and two officers who did not fire their weapons, he said.
But witness Trini Wright said: "The minivan came around the corner and smashed into their car, adding that the police had "jumped out shooting. No 'stop,' no 'freeze,' no nothing."
Mr Kelly said that it was unclear whether the officers, who were in plain clothes, had identified themselves before firing.
