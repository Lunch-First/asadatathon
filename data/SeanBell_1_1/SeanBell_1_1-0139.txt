A crowd led by civil rights leader Al Sharpton protested in New York after police shot dead an unarmed black man on the day of his wedding.
Dozens of shots were fired by officers that also wounded two of 23-year-old 
 friends. 
Mr Bell was killed as he left a strip club on Saturday morning, hours before he was to marry the mother of his two young children.
Some of those who were on the demonstration on Sunday called for the removal of the city's police commissioner. 
At the vigil and rally, a crowd led by civil rights leader the Rev Al Sharpton shouted "No justice, no peace."
At one point, the crowd of a few hundred counted up to 50, the number of rounds that are estimated to have been fired.
"We cannot allow this to continue to happen," Sharp-ton said. "We've got to understand that all of us were in that car." Some in the crowd called for the sacking of Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, yelling "Kelly must go".
Saturday's shootings happened around 4am outside the Kalua Cabaret, a strip club where Bell's stag party was held.
The car, driven by Bell, was struck by 21 bullets after the vehicle rammed an undercover officer and hit an unmarked NYPD minivan. Other shots hit nearby homes and shattered windows at a train station, though no one else was injured.
The survivors were Joseph Guzman, aged 31, who was shot at least 11 times, and Trent Benefield, aged 23, who was hit three times. Guzman was in critical condition and Benefield was stable.
The police officers' group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care said it was issuing a vote of no confidence in Kelly.
