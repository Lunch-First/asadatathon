<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NYPD task force at the center of Saturday's controversial police shooting has investigated 222 clubs and arrested 156 people - but has closed only two clubs, police records show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD club enforcement unit was created in August a month after the murder of Jennifer Moore, an 18-year-old New Jersey teen who was abducted, raped and killed after partying in Chelsea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police unit was designed to fight underage drinking, prostitution and gun violence. It initially focused on Chelsea's nightlife before moving to Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had established a good record in addressing conditions in Chelsea, and had begun to do the same at problem locations in Queens,&quot; Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unit has closed the Spirit club in Chelsea and the Secrets club in Jamaica. It has made 60 felony and 96 misdemeanor arrests and has issued 42 criminal summonses, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task force has been fighting to close several clubs, including Kalua Cabaret, the strip joint in Queens where 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his pals were partying Saturday before Bell was killed nearby by police bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators say the club has been a haven for drugs and prostitution. Police raided the club in March and cops arrested three people on drugs and weapons charges. The city also found numerous code violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens prosecutors say the State Liquor Authority took more than a month to respond to a request for help during an investigation of the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SLA, in turn, blames Queens prosecutors for the delays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of yesterday, an SLA administrative law judge had yet to act on a mid-October request to revoke the club's license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the club has yet to pay $2,700 fines imposed by the city Buildings Department in March.</SPAN></P>
