Hypocrisy, thy name is Sharpton. 
And Barron. 
Jackson, too. 
There they were this week, the Ubiquitous Three, comforting the grievingfamily of 

 - a black man shot dead in Queens by police - for atleast as long as the TV cameras lingered.  
What a contrast to the scene in Brooklyn Federal Court, where one RonellWilson is on trial in the 2003 murders of NYPD Detectives James Nemorin andRodney Andrews. 
No Al Sharpton there. 
No Charles Barron. 
No Jesse Jackson. 
The two detectives had been working undercover to break up a gun-runninggang operating out of a Staten Island housing project. Then a gun-buy wentdisastrously bad, their cover blown - and they were shot dead on the spot. 
Nemorin and Andrews, as it happened, were black. 
They died heroes in an effort to keep illegal guns out of a virtuallyall-black Staten Island housing project. 
That is to say, to save black lives. 
Nemorin left a wife and three children. 
Andrews, a wife and two kids. 
Their families grieved no less than the survivors of 


But without Sharpton. 
Without Barron. 
Without Jackson. 
No visit paid. 
Not a word of condolence. 
Nor has any of the three attended the Wilson trial. 
This is not surprising, for two reasons: 
* To do so would show a modicum of derivative respect for the NYPD. 
* And there are no media cameras in that particular courtroom. 
So what would be the point? 
Sharpton and Barron and Jackson care only about certain dead blackpeople. 
They care only about tragedies that present opportunities to sow rancor,and to advance their personal agendas. 
This is not news, of course, but it is worth pointing out that thefatherless children of hero cops need a hug, too. 
Not that Sharpton or Barron or Jackson gives a damn.
