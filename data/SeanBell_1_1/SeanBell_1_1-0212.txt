Police fired 50 rounds at a car of unarmed men leaving a stag party at a New York strip club, killing the groom.
The spray of bullets hit the car 21 times on Saturday night, after it rammed an undercover officer and an unmarked NYPD van, police said.
Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly would not say if the collisions were what prompted police to open fire.
Police thought one of the men in the car might have had a gun but found no weapons.
Kelly said the incident stemmed from an undercover operation inside the Kalua Cabaret strip club in Queens.
The groom, who was driving, was identified as 
 23. Two passengers were also injured, one critically.
