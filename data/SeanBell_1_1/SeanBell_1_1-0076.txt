The New York authorities were scrambling to contain a backlash this week after police shot a group of three unarmed black men, killing one of them on his wedding day. The shooting took place after a stag party at a strip club in Queens, a few hours before 
 23, was due to marry the mother of his two small daughters. He was struck in the neck and arm and was dead on arrival at hospital. 
One of his friends, Joseph Guzman, was in a critical condition after being hit 11 times, and another, Trent Benefield, was in a stable condition with wounds to his leg and buttocks.
Outrage at the shooting was com pounded when it emerged that Mr Guzman and Mr Benefield had been shackled to their beds. New Yorkers have also been startled at the apparent wildness of the fusillade from a mixed group of police, two white, two black and one Hispanic. The police claim to have heard one of the men mention a gun, but no weapon was found.
The officers fired 50 bullets at close range, but fewer than half hit the intended target, a car carrying the three men. The rest sprayed nearby cars and buildings. One shattered a window at a train station, injuring two transport police officers.
The shooting soon became political with the appearance of community leaders, including the Reverend Al Sharpton, the black civil rights leader who has led protests against police brutality - alongside the victims' relatives outside the hospital where the wounded were being treated.
The New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg, urged patience, saying it was too early to draw conclusions. "We know the officers on the scene had reason to believe an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and were trying to stop it." Richard Brown, the borough's district attorney, promised a "full, fair and complete investigation".
Officials fear a repeat of the Amadou Diallo affair in 1999. Diallo died in a hail of police bullets after reaching for his wallet.
