<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE THREE MEN shot by cops in Queens grew up together and stuck by each other through good times - and bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives and neighbors insisted that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield were family men whose friendship revolved around the positive things in life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all three also had criminal records, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell had been arrested twice in the past eight months on drug charges and he was busted in 2000 as a juvenile for possession of a firearm and three air pistols, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman's record includes nine arrests for drug offenses, but he had not been collared since a felony drug charge in 2002. He pleaded guilty in that case and recently completed parole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield was arrested in connection with a gunpoint robbery in 2002 and a drug bust in 2004, and cops have three arrest warrants for him on mostly minor charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those details were far from the minds of the trio's loved ones yesterday as controversy deepened over the shooting that left Bell dead and Guzman and Benefield wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, they painted a picture of vibrant young men from the streets of Far Rockaway bound together through tough economic times and growing pains by shared interests and history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were real good friends for a long time,&quot; said Tyheem Browning, 17, Guzman's brother. All three men loved kids. Bell, 23, and Guzman, 31, had families of their own; Benefield's girlfriend is expecting a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also found common ground through sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, who left behind two young daughters, was a star baseball player in high school. Guzman loves to shoot hoops near his home in Ocean Village, a high-rise housing development. Benefield, 23, worked in construction and coached youth basketball teams in his Jamaica neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He lived to teach little kids,&quot; said Melissa Morgan, 37, a neighbor of Benefield. &quot;He wanted to keep kids safe, teach them and support them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the kids in the community love him,&quot; added Tamara Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman also worked construction jobs and doted on his two children, Tyshaun, 11, and Juwan, 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He spends a lot of time with his kids,&quot; Browning said.</SPAN></P>
