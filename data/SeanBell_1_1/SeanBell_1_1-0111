<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spoken up over a deadly police shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says officers appeared to use excessive force when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened,'' Mr Bloomberg said at a news conference today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early on Saturday -- only hours before Mr Bell's wedding -- after a bachelor party at a strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspecting that one of the men had a gun, police fired 50 rounds into the vehicle. The men were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her first public comments on the shooting, Mr Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre, told a radio station that the people who shot her husband should not be called officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They were murderers, murderers,'' she said. ''They were not officers. No one gives anyone the right to kill somebody.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some have also questioned whether the shooting was racially motivated because the victims were all black men. The five officers who fired their guns included two blacks, two non-Hispanic whites and one Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the victims, Bloomberg said: ''There is no evidence that they were doing anything wrong'' -- referring to everything leading up to the moment they struck the officer with their car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gunfire stemmed from an undercover operation inside the Kalua Cabaret, where plain-clothes officers were investigating alleged prostitution and drug use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly has said the groom was involved in an argument outside the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An undercover officer walked closely behind Mr Bell and his friends as they headed for their car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he walked toward the front of the vehicle, they drove forward -- striking him and an undercover police vehicle, Mr Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bloomberg also said police appeared to have violated policy stating that officers cannot shoot at a vehicle used as a weapon if no other deadly force is involved.</SPAN></P>
