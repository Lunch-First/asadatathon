<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 3-year-old daughter of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is too young to understand how he died in a hail of 50 police bullets Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her family had to explain the loss to her in the simplest and most heartbreaking of terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hardest part is that Jada still wants her father,&quot; said Bishop Lester Williams, who was supposed to preside at the wedding of Jada's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that when Jada's puppy died recently, her dad told her to look to the sky, explaining, &quot;When you see the sun, that's the puppy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, we had to tell her, 'Daddy is taking care of the puppy. Look up and say hi to Daddy,'&quot; Williams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jada's mother, Nicole Paultre, was also having difficulty grasping the tragedy that left her alone, walking through the streets to ask for justice instead of celebrating her first day of marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are in shock, extreme shock,&quot; Williams said. &quot;The young lady called me and said, 'Can I still be married?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was killed after his bachelor party at a Queens strip club, just hours before he was supposed to be married to Paultre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives said he was planning to move his family to Georgia once he tied the knot. Bell's cousin Kinglarry Crawford, 35, said Paultre's father was going to buy the newlyweds a home in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, who had worked various jobs, including one as a UPS driver, wanted to raise two children in a quiet place with more opportunities, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is devastated,&quot; Crawford added. &quot;He is the first person in this family to be murdered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
