THE NYPD task force at the center of Saturday's controversial police shooting has investigated 222 clubs and arrested 156 people - but has closed only two clubs, police records show. 
The NYPD club enforcement unit was created in August a month after the murder of Jennifer Moore, an 18-year-old New Jersey teen who was abducted, raped and killed after partying in Chelsea.
The police unit was designed to fight underage drinking, prostitution and gun violence. It initially focused on Chelsea's nightlife before moving to Queens.
"They had established a good record in addressing conditions in Chelsea, and had begun to do the same at problem locations in Queens," Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said.
The unit has closed the Spirit club in Chelsea and the Secrets club in Jamaica. It has made 60 felony and 96 misdemeanor arrests and has issued 42 criminal summonses, police said.
The task force has been fighting to close several clubs, including Kalua Cabaret, the strip joint in Queens where 23-year-old 
 and his pals were partying Saturday before Bell was killed nearby by police bullets.
Investigators say the club has been a haven for drugs and prostitution. Police raided the club in March and cops arrested three people on drugs and weapons charges. The city also found numerous code violations.
Queens prosecutors say the State Liquor Authority took more than a month to respond to a request for help during an investigation of the club.
The SLA, in turn, blames Queens prosecutors for the delays.
As of yesterday, an SLA administrative law judge had yet to act on a mid-October request to revoke the club's license.
Meanwhile, the club has yet to pay $2,700 fines imposed by the city Buildings Department in March.
