<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO FIRED the shot that killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer lies in a series of microscopic scratches on four bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every gun leaves a distinct mark on a bullet, giving investigators a clear path to the cop or cops who fired the fatal round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bullets pierced Bell's neck and hip, perforating his lungs, liver and larynx. He was also shot in the right arm and the right shoulder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the bullets found in Bell have been turned over to NYPD ballistic examiners, according to the medical examiner's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're going to have to try to determine which bullets came from which guns,&quot; said James Gannalo, retired NYPD officer and ballistics expert. &quot;How easy that will be depends, in part, on the condition of the bullets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Vinegrad, former U.S. attorney from Brooklyn, said it might not make any difference in a prosecution whose bullets hit Bell because &quot;presumably they were all firing with the same intent, the same reason.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if everybody else stopped firing and the guy who shot 31 shots got off the last shots and it was one of those last shots that killed him,&quot; Vinegrad said, &quot;they may not all be equally responsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gannalo said investigators will first shoot a bullet into water with each of the five guns discharged by officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That will give them a clean sample of the markings on the inside of each gun barrel, said Albert Locher, assistant chief deputy district attorney in Sacramento, Calif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locher, who handles ballistics cases, said gun manufacturers use a tool that is pulled through the gun barrel and twisted to cut &quot;grooves and lands.&quot; The lands are the raised areas between two grooves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process of rifling causes unique scratches on each gun barrel - making bullets similar to fingerprints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the bullet is fired down the barrel of the gun - it's a tight fit - the rifling spins the bullet so it will be more stable in flight and more accurate,&quot; Locher said. &quot;As the bullet travels down the barrel it is pressed against the lands and grooves and the microscopic scratches get reversed on the bullet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Identification could be made difficult by damage done to bullets that were fired through glass or steel, or into bone, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops in the shooting were carrying different models of guns, which should make identification easier. While all of the guns were 9-mm. weapons, different manufacturers use different kinds of rifling.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graphic: THE DNA OF BULLETS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVERY GUN has its own virtual fingerprint that is imprinted on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">every bullet fired. That &quot;fingerprint&quot; is given by a series of indentations inside the gun barrel. The soft lead of the bullet's base gets marked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by these indentations, leaving microsopic scratches behind as the bullet spins through the barrel. These marks are unique to individual gun barrels, but each manufacturer generally has certain characteristics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE POLICE GUNS AT THE SCENE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sig Sauer P-226</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fired by Detective Mike Oliver and Officer Mike Carey</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These guns have 6/right rifling characteristics. That means they have six grooves that are angled to the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bullet shot from one of these guns would have the same pattern of angled scratches on its surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith &amp; Wesson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Model 5946</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fired by Detective Paul Headley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This gun, authorized by the NYPD as an alternative to the Glock and also issued by Royal Canadian Mounted Police, has 5/right rifle characteristics, with five grooves angled to the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the Sig Sauer and Smith &amp; Wesson guns are manufactured with traditional rifling, which creates deep grooves in the barrel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glock 19</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Mark Cooper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glock 26</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unnamed undercover cop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Glock also has 6/right rifling, but its manufacturer uses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a different method, polygonal rifling - where the grooves inside the barrel are less pronounced, making it more difficult to measure and match individual bullets to these guns.</SPAN></P>
