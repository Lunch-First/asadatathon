<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD lieutenant who led the police task force that blew away an unarmed bridegroom is a touchy-feely leader who flosses his teeth obsessively - and got bounced from his previous assignment because he put his family before the job, fellow cops told the Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He actually hugs us,&quot; one officer said of Lt. Gary Napoli. &quot;What boss does that?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Napoli, who ducked for cover when the shooting erupted early Saturday in Queens, is now in the middle of a crisis that could derail his career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the investigation into the tragic shooting that left 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dead and two other men wounded gains steam, portraits of Napoli and the other cops involved are emerging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Married with two kids, Napoli, 48, coaches his daughter's Westchester soccer team and is devoted to his elderly parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was that devotion that resulted in Napoli being ousted from his assignment with Manhattan North Narcotics, cops say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Napoli was transferred to the club enforcement unit soon after he took a vacation day to visit his elderly parents on the day he was supposed to attend a mandatory Compstat meeting, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 23-year veteran, who revs himself up by downing a cocktail of Red Bull energy drink and coffee, is known as a quirky commander who calls detectives &quot;Doctor&quot; and &quot;Laddie.&quot; Here is a look at the team he was leading:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Mike Oliver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tall and handsome, the 35-year-old vice cop logged more than 600 arrests during his 12-year career. But he had never shot his gun on the job until he fired 31 times early Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a regular at Chelsea's Bungalow 8 club where he was known as &quot;Undercover Mike,&quot; according to Radar Online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Oliver was three months out of the academy, he and another rookie were assigned to a Manhattan foot post. Hearing shots, they raced to the scene and found two men in a gunfight. The cops arrested the suspects without firing a shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shows the control he had even as a rookie, to draw his gun and handle a threat, make the arrests without firing,&quot; Detectives' Endowment Association President Michael Palladino said. &quot;That's not a cowboy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Mike Carey</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carey, who fired three times during the deadly shooting, has been a cop for five years. He is known as a go-getter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Midtown South supervisor called the 26-year-old &quot;Aces&quot; because he accepted any assignment and did his job well. &quot;One of the best rookies I've seen in years,&quot; the boss said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carey, who is white, has made 100 arrests. Married to another cop, he recently became a dad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover detective</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Daily News is withholding the 28-year-old's name to protect his safety. Brooklyn-born, the cop is Haitian and his mother Mexican. He still lives with his mom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He fired the opening salvo early Saturday, shooting 11 times. Since becoming a cop five years ago, he has notched 60 arrests. He also has one citation for meritorious police duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Cooper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Brooklyn narcotics cop with 17 years on the job, Cooper fired four times. He is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Hedley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nine-year veteran, Hedley, 35, fired once. The father of two lives with his police officer wife on Staten Island. He served in Iraq for a year before returning home in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told a neighbor, Noreen Urciuoli, on Monday, &quot;I'm not going to be around for a few days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a really affable guy,&quot; she said. &quot;We definitely like him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unidentified undercover</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">female detective</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was with the other undercover in the strip club. She did not fire. She is black.</SPAN></P>
