NEW YORK: Mayor Michael Bloomberg yesterday moved to defuse racial tensions in New York, describing as ''inexplicable'' how police fatally shot an unarmed black man just hours before his wedding. 
 23, died and two friends were hurt when their car was hit by a hail of bullets in an undercover operation that went wrong outside a Queens nightclub on Saturday.
''It is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened,'' he said.
It emerged yesterday that an undercover officer fired on the men's car as they tried to run him down after a fight outside the club.
The bullets went through the car, confusing other officers who arrived on the scene believing they were being shot at. They then started shooting, with one officer reloading as he fired 31 rounds.
