<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney has added her voice to a growing chorus of prominent Americans concerned about a spate of high-profile police shootings, including one that killed a New York man the day of his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The congresswoman has asked the Justice Department to investigate police-involved shootings around the nation, including in her home district of DeKalb County, where police have fatally shot a dozen people this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a belief by some citizens that the police-involved shootings are steeped in the intentional use of excessive force, even deadly force,&quot; McKinney said in a Nov. 25 letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez. &quot;There definitely appears to be a developing national pattern of police misconduct and abuse resulting in an inordinately high number of serious injuries and deaths to the victims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKinney has also asked the House Judiciary Committee to conduct hearings on &quot;the state of America's law enforcement agencies' use of force and deadly force and the impact on Americans on the basis of race and economic standing,&quot; her letter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Monday that the shooting early Saturday of three unarmed men, in which 50 bullets were fired, was &quot;unacceptable.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who died in the shooting, was to have been married later that day.</SPAN></P>
