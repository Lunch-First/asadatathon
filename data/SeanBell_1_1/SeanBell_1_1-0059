<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNDERCOVER COPS shot and killed a groom on his wedding day and wounded two other unarmed men early yesterday near a strip club in Queens - enraging the dead man's relatives, who called the shooting unjustified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was his wedding day - not his death day,&quot; said Oniaja Shepherd, 43, whose nephew </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed by police bullets. &quot;We were supposed to go to a wedding. Now we're going to a funeral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four detectives and one police officer sprayed 50 shots at Bell's car about 4 a.m. after the 23-year-old Queens man twice rammed his vehicle into an unmarked NYPD van, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell - a former high school baseball phenom who had been celebrating his bachelor party at the strip club - was mortally wounded. Two of his friends in the car were shot and rushed to a nearby hospital, police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No weapons were found on Bell or his friends, and no guns were found in their bullet-riddled car near the Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our hearts go out to them,&quot; Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said of Bell's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the investigation was ongoing. He stopped short of judging the actions of the officers involved as he did in 2004 when he said he believed the shooting of 19-year-old Timothy Stansbury by a Brooklyn cop was unjustified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sources said a plainclothes cop at yesterday's scene had identified himself as a cop before the officers fired. But Kelly said no witnesses had confirmed that account and brass had not interviewed the cops, pending a grand jury probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg issued a statement last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although it is too early to draw conclusions about this morning's shootings in Jamaica, Queens, we know that the NYPD officers on the scene had reason to believe that an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and were trying to stop it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;Commissioner Kelly, Deputy Mayor [Dennis] Walcott and I have been in touch with community leaders throughout the day to hear their concerns and update them on what we know, and we will keep them informed as this investigation continues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mayoral spokesman said the community leaders included the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's loved ones joined with Sharpton to condemn the cops' actions and demand information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lorenzo Kinred, who was at the bachelor's party, said he spoke to one of Bell's wounded pals, Trent Benefield, before he was put into an ambulance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police didn't identify who they were,&quot; Benefield said, according to Kinred, 32. &quot;They just pulled guns out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] saw a guy dressed just like us pulling a gun,&quot; Benefield added, Kinred said. &quot;He just wanted to try and drive away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Jamaica Hospital, where Bell died, Sharpton declared: &quot;Police do not have the right to be the judge, jury and executioners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton later visited Joseph Guzman, 31, and Benefield at Mary Immaculate Hospital. Guzman, who was in critical condition, was shot at least 11 times and had 17 entrance or exit wounds on his body. Benefield, who was in stable condition, was shot three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said it was &quot;outrageous at best&quot; that the wounded men were handcuffed to their hospital beds. &quot;Where are they going?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the men were unshackled as soon as it was discovered they had no weapons on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's grieving loved ones were enraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was supposed to be a special day,&quot; said Bell's father, William. &quot;No one in life should experience this kind of pain. It's not natural. A part of me is gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Les Paultre, the father of Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre, told cops: &quot;As you go home to your wives claiming you did your job, I want you to know you killed an innocent man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the fianc&eacute;e's mom, Laura Harper-Paultre, accused cops of killing Bell &quot;in cold blood,&quot; adding, &quot;Cops are very comfortable killing black men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But police adamantly denied the shooting was racially motivated, and Kelly said two of the cops who fired are black, two are white and another Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's 22-year-old fianc&eacute;e was at a bridal shower on Long Island when the dad of her two kids was killed. Puffy-eyed, Paultre arrived at the scene of the shooting yesterday morning. &quot;I am the intended bride,&quot; she said before collapsing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was at the strip club with about 20 friends, police sources said. Two plainclothes cops, looking to make prostitution arrests, were also inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 3 a.m., one of the undercover cops heard a bouncer suggest to a dancer that he had a gun, and the cops went outside to warn plainclothes officers in a nearby van, the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An hour later, a fight erupted outside the club. Bell, Guzman and Benefield were allegedly among eight men yelling at another man, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the undercover cops heard Bell shout, &quot;Let's f--- him up,&quot; and Guzman say, &quot;Yo - go get my gun,&quot; Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's getting hot on Liverpool, for real, I think there's a gun,&quot; the undercover warned his lieutenant, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops followed the men as they got into Bell's car on Liverpool St. Bell drove forward, brushing the plainclothes cop before slamming into the unmarked police van as it rounded the corner, Kelly said. It was then that one of the undercovers identified himself as a cop and fired the first round, the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell threw the car into reverse and slammed into a building, then drove forward into the van again. Plainclothes cops poured from the van and five began shooting, hitting Bell twice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops used dogs to follow a blood trail in search of a fourth man who witnesses said ran from the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least two bullets fired during the altercation hit a parked car and another slug flew into a nearby house. A bullet also whizzed by a pair of Port Authority cops standing on an elevated AirTrain platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's mom, Valerie, said cops hadn't told her anything about the shooting. &quot;They're covering up, because they know the police did wrong,&quot; she charged. &quot;You know how society works. They label all African-American men the same. They should have pulled out a badge before they started shooting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GRAPHIC HOW SHOOTING HAPPENED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Bell pulls his car out of a parking spot on Liverpool Street. He strikes an undercover cop and slams into an unmarked police van. The undercover cop opens fire as Bell backs his car up onto the sidewalk, hitting the building and almost hitting another cop standing on the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Bell pulls forward and slams into the police van a second time. Five officers open fire shooting more than 50 rounds, killing Bell and wounding his pals. The cops, including the officer hit by Bell's car, suffer only minor injuries.</SPAN></P>
