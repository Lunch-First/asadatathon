Now, Mrs Nedbuster wasn't suggesting for a minute our own jakeys should get a cap in their ass. She was talking more about community sentences like the one that saw Boy George sweeping the New York streets for taking drugs.
But after a trigger-happy tragedy like the one that left two kiddies fatherless, maybe it's the last city we should be looking to for any advice.
