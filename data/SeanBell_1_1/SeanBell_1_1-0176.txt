Police fired 50 rounds at a car of unarmed men leaving a stag party at a New York strip club, killing the groom. 
The spray of bullets hit the car 21 times, after the vehicle rammed into an undercover officer and then an unmarked NYPD van twice, police said.
Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly would not say if the collisions were what prompted police to open fire.
Police thought one of the men in the car might have had a gun. But armed with a search warrant, police found no weapons.
Commissioner Kelly said the incident stemmed from an undercover operation inside the strip club. Seven officers in plain clothes were investigating the Kalua Cabaret, and five were involved in the shooting. The gunfire also hit nearby homes and a train station.
The groom, who was driving, was identified as 
 aged 23.
The shooting drew angry protests from family members and civil rights leader the Reverend Al Sharpton.
At Jamaica Hospital, the civil rights advocate stood with about two dozen members of Bell's and his fiancee's family.
"I will stand with this family," he said. "This stinks. Something about the story being told did not seem right."
Rev Sharpton said Mr Bell and his fiancee had two children, aged three years and five m onths.
