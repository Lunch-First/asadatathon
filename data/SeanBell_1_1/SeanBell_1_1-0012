<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The morning team at WRKS (98.7 FM) conducts one of radio's most tangible holiday-help projects tomorrow with its &quot;Kiss Cares Coat Drive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Listeners are asked to bring winter coats - which can be used, as long as they're still wearable - to the Alvin Ailey Dance Studio, W. 55th St. and Ninth Ave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are distributed directly to people who need coats, primarily at homeless shelters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It sounds like such a simple thing that a lot of us probably don't even think about it,&quot; says morning co-host Jeff Foxx. &quot;But there are a lot of people, too many people, who don't have a coat. You have kids going to school without a warm coat, which means they're much more likely to get sick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coat Drive runs 6 a.m.-6 p.m., and the morning team - Foxx, Shaila, Talent, Bob Slade - plan to stay around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can get pretty silly by 3 o'clock,&quot; says Foxx. &quot;But whatever you do is worth it when you see the look on the face of a kid when you give him a coat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be the fourth clothing drive, which has gathered up to 13,000 coats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And by the way, Foxx adds, listeners are also invited to bring turtlenecks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talent wants to do Turtlenecks for Toddlers,&quot; he says. &quot;So that's part of it, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROSSOVER'S BACK: E. Reese Hopkins, better known as Crossover Negro Reese on the Star &amp; Buc Wild show, is returning to WWPR (105.1 FM) this morning to join the Egypt and Ashy (Donnell Rawlins) morning team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopkins, who will now just be &quot;Crossover&quot; on the air, will be doing news segments and joining the general conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also won't be coming back quietly. &quot;I plan to call people out on the assassination of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; he said, referring to the young man killed by police fire Saturday outside a Queens strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, he says, he wants to spotlight the role of City Council members who did not heed a neighborhood petition asking that the club not be allowed to open there in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's too easy just to blame an entity like 'the police,' &quot; said Crossover. &quot;Police officers are human beings just like all of us, and they make mistakes. We need to look closely at a picture like this, identify who did or didn't do what and make everyone take responsibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crossover left Star's show on WWPR 14 months ago. He said he's &quot;delighted that [WWPR program director] Helen Little and [Clear Channel senior vice president] Tom Poleman are giving me an opportunity to come back. I never realized how addictive this is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAD BOY'S BACK, TOO: Michael Baisden, the self-proclaimed &quot;baddest man on radio,&quot; returned yesterday afternoon to WRKS (98.7 FM), saying, &quot;The grown-folks party is back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baisden didn't immediately explain why he was off the air for the last month, calling it a &quot;little hiatus&quot; during which he continued to host live events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His absence sparked a blizzard of rumors, which Baisden derided yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sorry to disappoint all you haters out there,&quot; he said. &quot;But I'm not fired - this party's still going down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WDIA HISTORY: We noted here yesterday the death of John R. Pepper II, who put the country's first all-black format on WDIA in Memphis back in 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The station has compiled a fascinating double-CD set of its history, starting with early airchecks by hosts like Nat D. Williams. It's a great slice of radio, and Rufus Thomas' ad for &quot;Pink Pussy Cat Wine&quot; is worth the price all by itself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AROUND THE DIAL: The Writers Guild of America, which represents newswriters at WCBS-AM (880) and WINS (1010 AM) among other places, has overwhelmingly rejected a contract offer from CBS that would have run through August 2010. Guild officials recommended the proposal be rejected, which CBS called &quot;unfortunate.&quot; ... Jamie Lee is returning this weekend to WPLJ (95.5 FM), where she will be hosting the all-request &quot;Saturday Night '80s,&quot; 7-midnight. ... Former President Jimmy Carter guests tomorrow morning at 7:10 with Joe Bartlett and Donna Hanover on WOR (710 AM).</SPAN></P>
