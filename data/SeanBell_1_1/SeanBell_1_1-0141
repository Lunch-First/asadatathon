<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Mayor Michael Bloomberg weighed in on the uproar over a deadly police shooting Monday, saying bluntly that officers appeared to use excessive force when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man in a confrontation outside a strip club hours before his wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened,&quot; Bloomberg said at a news conference after meeting with elected officials and community leaders including the Rev. Al Sharpton and Rep. Charles Rangel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early Saturday after a bachelor party at the strip club. Suspecting that one of the men had a gun, police fired 50 rounds into the vehicle. The men were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton called it a &quot;very candid&quot; meeting. He said the message to Bloomberg was: &quot;This city must show moral outrage that 50 shots were fired on three unarmed men.&quot; Some have also questioned whether the shooting was racially motivated because the victims were all black men. The five officers who fired their guns included two blacks, two whites and one Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the victims, Bloomberg said Monday: &quot;There is no evidence that they were doing anything wrong,'' referring to everything leading up to the moment they struck the officer with their car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Department begins spying inquiry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - The Justice Department has begun an internal investigation into its handling of information gathered in the government's domestic spying program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Democrats criticized the review as too narrow to determine whether the program violated federal law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquiry by Glenn A. Fine, the department's inspector general, will focus on the role of Justice prosecutors and agents in carrying out the warrantless surveillance program run by the National Security Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fine's investigation is not expected to address whether the controversial program is an unconstitutional expansion of presidential power, as its critics and a federal judge in Detroit have charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After conducting initial inquiries into the program, we have decided to open a program review that will examine the department's controls and use of information related to the program,'' Fine wrote in a letter dated Monday to House Judiciary Committee leaders. The four-paragraph letter was obtained by The Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said the agency welcomes the review: &quot;We expect that this review will assist Justice Department personnel in ensuring that the department's activities comply with the legal requirements that govern the operation of the program.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD, Iraq - Mortar rounds crashed into an oil processing facility near the northern city of Kirkuk on Monday, igniting a huge blaze, and a U.S. Air Force jet with one pilot crashed while supporting American soldiers fighting in Anbar province, a hotbed of Iraq's Sunni Arab insurgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fire at the pipeline filtering facility shut down the flow of crude to the massive Beiji refinery to the southwest, according to an official at the North Oil Co., who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. The flames erupted at 6:30 p.m. and burned for several hours before they were extinguished, the U.S. military said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facility is 15 miles northwest of Kirkuk, a city that sits amid some of Iraq's richest crude oil deposits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Monday, a bomb exploded beneath an oil pipeline south of Baghdad and set it on fire, and Iraqi and American forces were deployed to secure the area, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No injuries were reported in the 7:30 a.m. blast near Mahmoudiya, about 20 miles south of Baghdad, said police 1st Lt. Haider Satar. The fire was put out about noon. The pipeline carries crude oil from storage tanks in nearby Latifiyah to the Dora refinery in Baghdad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olmert holds out hand in peace to Palestinians</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reached out to the Palestinians on Monday in one of his most conciliatory speeches yet, saying he was prepared to grant them a state, release desperately needed funds and free prisoners if they choose the path of peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olmert's remarks sealed a dramatic policy shift and built on a day-old truce meant to end five months of violence in the Gaza Strip, but new rocket attacks by Palestinian militants threatened the latest rapprochement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hold out my hand in peace to our Palestinian neighbors in the hope that it won't be returned empty,&quot; Olmert said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot change the past and we will not be able to bring back the victims on both sides of the borders,'' he said. &quot;All that we can do today is stop additional tragedies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olmert appealed to the Palestinians to form a new, moderate Cabinet committed to carrying out a U.S.-backed peace plan and securing the release of a captured Israeli soldier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once such a government was established, Olmert said, he would call for an immediate meeting with the moderate Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, &quot;to have a real, open, honest, serious dialogue between us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palestinian legislator Saeb Erekat, a top Abbas aide, said the Palestinians were ready to negotiate a final peace deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House says Iraq violence in 'new phase'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TALLINN, Estonia - President Bush intensified diplomatic efforts on Monday to quell rising violence in Iraq and Afghanistan, turning to allies as his national security adviser said the conflict in Iraq had entered &quot;a new phase&quot; requiring changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously everyone would agree things are not proceeding well enough or fast enough,'' National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley told reporters aboard Air Force One as Bush flew eastward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president was spending Monday night in this tiny Baltic nation ahead of a two-day NATO summit in Riga, Latvia, expected to deal with deteriorating conditions in Afghanistan, where NATO has 32,000 troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Estonia and Latvia are former Soviet republics that are strong allies in the war on terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush will head to Amman, Jordan, for talks Wednesday and Thursday with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and King Abdullah of Jordan.</SPAN></P>
