The white detective who squeezed off 31 of 50 shots at three unarmed men outside a Queens strip joint had a clean record, never fired his gun in the line of duty and was known as a good street cop. 
His unblemished history left fellow officers puzzled yesterday over what led the 12-year veteran to get down on one knee and empty two clips on the darkened Jamaica street early Saturday morning.
"He lost it. Four or five rounds - maybe. But to reload? It's hard to understand. Even in the heat of the moment, it's overkill," a law enforcement source said.
In all, seven plainclothes officers were involved in what should have been a textbook prostitution sting as part of the city's effort to shutter the Kalua Cabaret.
But the NYPD has interviewed only two cops - the ones who did not fire: an undercover detective who remained outside the club and a lieutenant who ducked behind the dashboard of his unmarked car when bullets flew.
Questioning the officers who fired falls to the Queens district attorney's office, which sources said plans to present the case to a grand jury this week. Of the five, two are white, two are black and one is Hispanic.
Aside from the 12-year vet, the other officers involved in the shooting are:
n An undercover Hispanic officer with five years on the job who fired first and shot 11 rounds.
n A five-year veteran who fired three times.
n A 17-year veteran who fired four times.
n A nine-year veteran who fired once.
