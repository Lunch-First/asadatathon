<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAYOR Bloomberg said yesterday he'll honor the wishes of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relatives and not attend tonight's funeral for the 23-year-old groom who was killed last Saturday by police bullets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I talked to their minister yesterday and decided that I'm not going to go to the funeral,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I've expressed myself and my sympathies on behalf of the city to the family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Deputy Mayor Dennis Walcott, who lives in Bell's neighborhood and is black, will attend the funeral at 7 p.m. at Community Church of Christ in Jamaica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Lester Williams, the church pastor, confirmed the family asked Bloomberg to stay away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mayor is doing the right thing and respecting their wishes that this not be turned into a media frenzy,&quot; Williams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg met privately Tuesday at Williams' church with Bell's parents, William and Valerie, and his fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre. Bell and Paultre were supposed to get married the day he was killed and his two friends were wounded by police outside a seedy strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plainclothes and undercover cops fired 50 bullets at the unarmed men after Bell twice rammed his car into an unmarked police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg has characterized the number of shots fired as &quot;excessive,&quot; which has angered some police advocates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, black community leaders have bristled at Bloomberg's unwillingness to outright condemn the police involved in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
