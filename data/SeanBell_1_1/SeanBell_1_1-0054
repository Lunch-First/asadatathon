<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">SEAN BELL</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gave up his dream of playing professional baseball so he could focus on his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in recent months, the itch had come back. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was recently getting back into it,&quot; said his older brother, William Bell, 28. &quot;He was training seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a student at John Adams High School in Ozone Park, Queens, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a dominant pitcher in the Public Schools Athletic League.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He graduated in 2001, closing out his senior season with an 11-0 record, 97 strikeouts and a stingy 2.14 earned run average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a good-hearted man,&quot; said his mother, Valerie Bell. &quot;He would have been in pro ball, but he wanted to be with his children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell pitched for Nassau Community College after leaving high school and then started a family with his fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre, 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They had two daughters - Jada, 3, and Jordyn, 5 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives said Bell had bounced around jobs in the past few years, working a stint as a UPS driver and more recently delivering milk to businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the past few weeks, he was working with a trainer to get into game shape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He put his dream on hold for his kids,&quot; said his fianc&eacute;e's mother, Laura Harper-Paultre. &quot;He loved them that much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
