 gave up his dream of playing professional baseball so he could focus on his family.
But in recent months, the itch had come back. 
"He was recently getting back into it," said his older brother, William Bell, 28. "He was training seriously."
As a student at John Adams High School in Ozone Park, Queens, 
 was a dominant pitcher in the Public Schools Athletic League.
He graduated in 2001, closing out his senior season with an 11-0 record, 97 strikeouts and a stingy 2.14 earned run average.
"He was a good-hearted man," said his mother, Valerie Bell. "He would have been in pro ball, but he wanted to be with his children."
Bell pitched for Nassau Community College after leaving high school and then started a family with his fiance, Nicole Paultre, 22.
They had two daughters - Jada, 3, and Jordyn, 5 months.
Relatives said Bell had bounced around jobs in the past few years, working a stint as a UPS driver and more recently delivering milk to businesses.
But in the past few weeks, he was working with a trainer to get into game shape.
"He put his dream on hold for his kids," said his fiance's mother, Laura Harper-Paultre. "He loved them that much."
