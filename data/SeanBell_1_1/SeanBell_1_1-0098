<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops said they thought one of the men in the car had a gun - raisingthe possibility that the fleeing man was armed and dumped the weapon as heran off. Officers were spotted Tuesday searching the area around theshooting scene for a firearm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Guzman, 31, who was shot 11 times and remained in criticalcondition at Mary Immaculate Hospital, spoke out about the shooting for thefirst time yesterday, saying that he was sure the police were trying tokill him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They tried to kill me. They tried to kill me. They killed Sean. Theytried to kill us. We didn't have nothing. We didn't have nothing,&quot; he toldthe Rev. Al Sharpton, who visited him at his bedside, along with the Rev.Jesse Jackson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They tried to kill us, they tried to kill us,&quot; Sharpton said he keptrepeating. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman had been only semi-conscious until yesterday, when he was finallyable to speak about the night all hell broke loose outside the KaluaCabaret.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those are the most poignant statements he made and we tried to consolehim that we are working with him,&quot; Jackson said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, he's just coming into his own consciousness and pleading forhelp,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;And we promised him we will do what has to be doneto get justice.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman had gone with Bell and Benefield to the club on Friday night tocelebrate Bell's impending nuptials. The club, however, was being monitoredfor prostitution by undercover cops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the night wore on, an undercover officer inside the club spotted a mandressed in black carrying what the officer believed was a gun. Heimmediately called his supervisor, Lt. Gary Napoli - who was outside withother plainclothes officers - and reported there might be an armed maninside. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The club closed not long after, at 4 a.m. Saturday, and an undercoverofficer spotted the man in black get into a heated argument out front withBell and his friends. The officer said he grew alarmed when he overheardGuzman yell, &quot;Yo, get my gun!&quot; sources have said. </SPAN></P>
