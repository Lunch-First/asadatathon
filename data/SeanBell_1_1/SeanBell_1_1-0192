<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">GRAPHIC: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photo: Osman Orsal, the Associated Press , TURKEY Some 25,000 protesters denounced Pope Benedict as an enemy of Islam at a rally yesterday that underlined deep divisions straining Turkey ahead of the pontiff's visit this week. Officials hoping to promote closer ties with the West urged calm, but Islamic groups wary of western ways united in anger over Benedict's remarks two months ago linking Islam to violence. The protest, organized by an Islamist political party, was the largest mass gathering so far against Benedict's four-day visit scheduled to begin tomorrow, his first papal journey to a mostly Muslim country. Turkish officials hope to use the visit to promote their ambitions of becoming the first Muslim country in the European Union and to showcase Turkey's secular political system. But Islamic groups, which have been gaining strength, see Benedict as a symbol of western intolerance and injustices against Muslims.; Photo: Fabrizio Giovannozzi, the Associated Press , ITALY Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was admitted to the intensive care unit of a Milan hospital for tests yesterday after collapsing while giving a speech. Apparently vigorous and looking younger than his 70 years, he collapsed while delivering a speech to a youth rally in Tuscany. Aides rushed to carry him from the stage. An ambulance arrived, but he walked to leave in his own car. His spokesman, Paolo Bonaiuti, said at the time that he had merely suffered from a drop in blood pressure. Berlusconi, who overcame prostate cancer in the 1990s, told reporters yesterday's problem was a mixture of fatigue, heat and antibiotics he had taken after a recent operation on his knees.; Photo: Jeff Mcintosh, the Canadian Press , ALBERTA Canada's home of bedrock conservatism is a heartbeat away from a seismic shift that could see Alberta's governing Progressive Conservatives move to the far right and perhaps fracture a party that has dominated the province for 35 years. Ted Morton, a rookie backbencher but with deep roots in the Reform party, finished a close second on the weekend to front-runner Jim Dinning, above, denying the former provincial treasurer a first-ballot victory in the race to replace Ralph Klein as party leader and premier. Morton and Dinning, along with veteran cabinet minister Ed Stelmach, square off in a second and final vote this coming Saturday, in which party members will rank the three in order of preference. Morton, 57, worked behind the scenes on the national stage as policy director when the Reform party morphed into the Canadian Alliance before he himself jumped into provincial politics in 2004.; Photo: Ben Curtis, the Associated Press , LEBANON Lebanese troops are on high alert after a top Hezbollah official said the militant Shiite Muslim group will press ahead with threatened street protests seeking to topple Lebanon's western-backed government. The comments by Sheik Naim Kassem came a day after the Lebanese cabinet approved a plan for an international tribunal to try suspects in the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri, overriding objections from Hezbollah and other factions allied with Syria, which many Lebanese blame for the killing. The country is divided between opponents and supporters of Syria, which dominated Lebanon for nearly 30 years until mass street protests and international pressure forced Damascus to withdraw occupying troops last year.; Photo: Peter Morrison, the Associated Press , NORTHERN IRELAND Michael Stone, centre, the Protestant extremist tackled Friday by guards at the Northern Ireland Assembly, has been charged with attempting to murder four people, including Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. Stone, 51, has been an icon of extremism since March 16, 1988, when he single-handedly attacked more than 20,000 mourners at an IRA funeral, killing three people and wounding about 60. Later sentenced to more than 700 years in prison, he was paroled in mid-2000 as part of the 1998 Good Friday peace accord. Legal officials now hope to send him back to prison to resume his previous sentence, likely delaying any resolution of the new charges. Stone opposes efforts to have Protestants share power with Sinn Fein.; Photo: Lynne Sladky, the Associated Press , FLORIDA Marlie Casseus, centre, is eager to return to school in her Haitian homeland after a series of operations in Miami have given her hope of a more normal life. The surgeons rebuilt much of the 14-year-old's face and jaw after removing a basketball-sized tumour that has been growing for 10 years. Doctors said her condition is a rare form of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, a nonhereditary genetic disease, which affects every bone in her body, though not to the severity with which it disfigured her face. Doctors say she may need more cosmetic surgery when she stops growing. But she will soon be able to speak again and her liquid diet will slowly be replaced by pur&eacute;ed, soft foods. In her room at Ronald McDonald House near the Miami hospital, Marlie has a book bag packed for the day she returns home.

The guest of honour in Benieli, Mali, was Governor General Micha&euml;lle Jean, currently on a tour of five African nations, who joined in the dancing. The improvements all began seven years ago when a local woman learned that Canadian help was available to establish a contraceptive program that would prevent the spread of AIDS and help control population growth. Then came a microfinance program that has grown tenfold, cereal banks that stabilized grain prices, and a health centre built with $50,000 from Canada but run with local funds. &quot;We can only thank Canada,&quot; said a village spokesman.; Photo: CANADA Bloc Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois Leader Gilles Duceppe sought the support of prominent sovereigntists before grudgingly agreeing to vote in favour of a Conservative motion on Quebec nationhood, says Montreal's La Presse. The newspaper says Duceppe consulted several political allies, including former premiers Jacques Parizeau, Bernard Landry and Lucien Bouchard. He also spoke with his counterpart at the Parti Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois, Andr&eacute; Boisclair, before stunning the country with news that the separatist party would vote in favour of the Conservative motion. Sources said Duceppe also consulted constitutional experts who convinced him that the motion, which recognizes a Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois nation &quot;within a united Canada,&quot; will have no negative effect on provincial hopes of becoming a sovereign nation.; Photo: Salvatore Laporta, the Associated Press , ENGLAND British police will question Italian security consultant Mario Scaramella, above, who admits eating at a restaurant with former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko before he fell ill with radiation poisoning. Litvinenko issued a deathbed statement blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin. But police haven't ruled out even self-poisoning in Litvinenko's bid to discredit Putin.; Photo: ONTARIO A former U.S. college hockey captain is in a coma after a brutal attack in Toronto's Bloor West Village. Michael Serba, 25, visiting from Vermont, was out with friends early Saturday when he was punched after leaving a bar to use an ATM machine. He later caught up with his attacker in an alley where he was struck with an object -- likely a brick -- and then &quot;stomped on,&quot; police said. A 22-year-old is charged with attempted murder.; Photo: NEW YORK An angry crowd demanded yesterday to know why New York City police killed an unarmed man, firing dozens of shots that also wounded two of his friends. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, died early Saturday, the day he was to marry the mother of his two young children. The shootings occurred about 4 a.m. outside a strip club where Bell's bachelor party was held. Police say the car driven by Bell hit an undercover officer and an unmarked NYPD minivan.; Photo: Victor Ruiz Caballero, Reuters , CHILE General Augusto Pinochet took full responsibility for the first time Saturday for the actions of his 1973-90 Chilean dictatorship, which carried out thousands of political killings. At a celebration of his 91st birthday, Pinochet also defended the bloody military coup that toppled freely elected Marxist President Salvador Allende. Pinochet is under indictment in two human rights abuse cases. Until now, the courts have dropped charges against him, citing his poor health.; : Jonathan Hayward, the Canadian Press ,</SPAN></P>
