NEW YORK: The police officer who fired the opening salvo in a 50-shot barrage that felled a Queens man on his wedding day has told his story for the first time. 
The detective insisted he identified himself as a cop long before he fired on the car carrying 
 and his friends on Saturday morning.
''This cop screamed, 'police' and had his shield out,'' attorney Philip Karasyk said on Tuesday.
The detective held his fire despite Mr Bell clipping him with his car, Mr Karasyk said of his unidentified client.
Four other officers also opened fire on the car, Mr Karasyk said.
When the gunfire was over, Bell was dead and two passengers were badly wounded.
