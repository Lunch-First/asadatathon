NEW York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spoken up over a deadly police shooting.
He says officers appeared to use excessive force when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man. 
''I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened,'' Mr Bloomberg said at a news conference today.
The groom, 
 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early on Saturday -- only hours before Mr Bell's wedding -- after a bachelor party at a strip club.
Suspecting that one of the men had a gun, police fired 50 rounds into the vehicle. The men were unarmed.
In her first public comments on the shooting, Mr Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre, told a radio station that the people who shot her husband should not be called officers.
''They were murderers, murderers,'' she said. ''They were not officers. No one gives anyone the right to kill somebody.''
Some have also questioned whether the shooting was racially motivated because the victims were all black men. The five officers who fired their guns included two blacks, two non-Hispanic whites and one Hispanic.
Of the victims, Bloomberg said: ''There is no evidence that they were doing anything wrong'' -- referring to everything leading up to the moment they struck the officer with their car.
The gunfire stemmed from an undercover operation inside the Kalua Cabaret, where plain-clothes officers were investigating alleged prostitution and drug use.
Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly has said the groom was involved in an argument outside the club.
An undercover officer walked closely behind Mr Bell and his friends as they headed for their car.
As he walked toward the front of the vehicle, they drove forward -- striking him and an undercover police vehicle, Mr Kelly said.
Mr Bloomberg also said police appeared to have violated policy stating that officers cannot shoot at a vehicle used as a weapon if no other deadly force is involved.
