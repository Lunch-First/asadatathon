<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - U.S. soldiers fought with suspected insurgents using a building as a safe house in Ramadi on Tuesday, killing one Iraqi man and five females, ranging in age from an infant to teenagers, the U.S. military said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramadi, 70 miles west of Baghdad, has been the scene of some of Iraq's fiercest fighting between U.S. forces and Sunni insurgents. It is the capital of Anbar province, where many Iraqi insurgents are based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bloodshed came on a day that saw sectarian violence kill 10 other Iraqis and wound about 50, police said. The bodies of 50 torture victims also were discovered, most of them in Baghdad and the city of Baqouba to the north, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Michael Bloomberg met Tuesday with the family of the man who was killed on his wedding day in a barrage of police gunfire as he left his bachelor party, and investigators questioned a third civilian witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days after the fatal encounter, it remained unclear why four detectives and one police officer opened fire while conducting an undercover operation at a strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unidentified witness was on a darkened block in Queens when five police officers killed 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and injured two friends as the three sat inside a car, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two other civilian witnesses: One woman on the street who says she saw officers firing their weapons, and a second woman who from her window spotted a man running away from the area around the time of the shooting. Investigators tried to determine if that man had been with the three who were shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Bloomberg went to the Bell family's Queens church, where he met for about an hour with the parents and fiancee of the victim, along with the Rev. Al Sharpton. The mayor then met at a restaurant with about 50 community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JDEIDET YABOUS, Syria (AP) - The Syrian leader of an Islamic militant group blew himself up Tuesday after trying to cross into Lebanon and engaging in a gunbattle with Syrian border forces. Two border guards were wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident raises questions about the security of the Lebanese-Syrian frontier, which Israel contends is a gateway for weapons to rearm Hezbollah militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes at a time of increased tension in Lebanon as the struggle intensifies between the anti-Syria government and factions led by Hezbollah, Syria's ally in Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Syrian Interior Ministry said in a statement the clash began when Omar Abdullah, 28, the leader of the Islamic militant group Tawhid and Jihad, was challenged when he tried to cross into Lebanon with fake documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness said Abdullah was standing outside the passport control building when security agents approached. He opened fire with a handgun, wounding two guards, then ran toward the nearby village of Kfeir Yabous about 500 yards away.</SPAN></P>
