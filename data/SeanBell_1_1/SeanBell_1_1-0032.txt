PEERING INTO A CAR, an undercover cop yelled, "Gun! Gun!" when he saw one of the passengers reaching for something in his waistband - and fired the first of 50 shots that led to the death of a bridegroom on his wedding day.
When it was over, 23-year-old 
 was dead, his two friends were badly wounded and no gun was found.
The Hispanic officer, whose name was not available last night, told other cops that he followed Bell and his buddies from a notorious Queens strip club to his Nissan Altima outside. He said he flashed his shield and yelled to "Show your hands!" before Bell clipped him with the vehicle.
Then he saw the front-seat passenger, later identified as Joseph Guzman, reach toward his waistband, police sources told the Daily News - prompting him to fire 11 rounds at the men, beginning the deadly fusillade. 
The controversial shooting led community leaders to stage two emotional meetings yesterday, one with Mayor Bloomberg and another last night with Queens District Attorney Richard Brown.
Emerging from his meeting, Bloomberg denounced the shooting - even as he cautioned against rushing to judgment.
"It's hard for me to understand why 50-odd shots were taken," Bloomberg said at the City Hall news conference, where he stood alongside several black elected officials. "To me that sounds like excessive force."
Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly also indicated that the five cops involved in the shooting broke NYPD regulations, including those concerning the use of deadly force.
Kelly said NYPD rules prohibit cops from shooting at a car, even when it's being used as a weapon. He also said this appears to be a case of "contagious fire."
"We stress, when officers go to the range, that they fire no more than three rounds," he said. "And, then, they look."
Although Bell and another of the wounded men, Trent Benefield, 23, were black, Bloomberg said it doesn't appear race figured in the early-morning shooting.
Two of the five officers who opened fire are black, two are white and the officer who fired the first shot is Hispanic.
But Bloomberg acknowledged the mounting anger over the fatal shooting of yet another unarmed black man. "The community is outraged, and I am, to put it mildly, deeply disturbed," he said.
Bell's fiance had stronger words for the five officers who took away her bridegroom.
"They murdered him," a sobbing Nicole Paultre told Brown last night at the emotional meeting with black leaders.
Police sources identified the white cops as Detective Mike Oliver, who fired 31 shots, and Officer Mike Carey, who fired three times.
Also on the scene was Lt. Jerry Napoli, a white 23-year veteran who ducked for cover under a dashboard when the shooting started, the sources said.
The names of the other officers who discharged their guns were not available last night. They have all been placed on administrative leave and ordered to surrender their weapons.
After the shooting, Detectives' Endowment Association President Michael Palladino called the shooting justified because Bell was using his car as a "lethal weapon." He continued to blame the victims yesterday.
"If the driver of the vehicle had responded to the detective's command this would not have happened," he said. "He would be a married man today."
Kelly conceded that one of the two undercover officers who were also inside the Kalua Cabaret on 94th Ave. in Jamaica before the shooting had a couple of beers, but he said it was not a factor in the incident. Sources identified that cop as a woman but did not divulge her name.
"We authorize them to have two drinks and no more," he said. "This whole initiative started at 1 o'clock in the morning. So they were in the club for as long as three hours."
Cops making an arrest are supposed to identify themselves, but the NYPD has found no witnesses who say they did, sources said.
Benefield, who was hit three times and was in stable condition yesterday, told a pal that he and those in the car thought the cops were hoods.
"They didn't know they were cops," said Shamel O'Neal, 20, after visiting Benefield at Mary Immaculate Hospital. "They thought they were in trouble. They feared for their lives."
Guzman, 31, was in critical condition last night and undergoing surgery to remove bullets from his body. He was shot 11 times.
According to police and witness accounts, this is the most credible version of the tragic shooting:
Life-long pals, Benefield and Guzman had taken Bell out for a stag night at the club, which undercover cops were investigating for drugs and prostitution.
When they left at 4 a.m., Bell exchanged angry words with another patron outside the club and one of his friends referred to a gun, Kelly said.
Undercover cops are supposed to hang back to keep from being unmasked and let other officers make a bust. But when Bell and his pals continued on to Liverpool St. to the groom's car, the Hispanic cop was hot on their heels.
"He was still acting in the undercover capacity when he followed the group down the street," Kelly said. "He did, apparently, take some enforcement action, and that's unusual, yes."
Police said Bell clipped the officer with his car and then twice rammed into the cops' unmarked minivan.
There is still some question of whether a fourth man was about to get into Bell's car; a witness has told The News he saw that man bolt when the undercover cop approached.
After the shooting, some black leaders called on Bloomberg to fire Kelly.
"[Amadou] Diallo, 41 shots. This is 50 shots," said Charles Aziz Bilal, a spokesman for Guzman's family and the imam of the Al-Han-Dullah Mosque in Queens. "What's next, 60 shots, 70 shots, 90 shots? When will it stop?"
