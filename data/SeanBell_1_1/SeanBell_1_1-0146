<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">GRAPHIC: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photo: Moshe Milner, Reuters , JERUSALEM Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reached out to Palestinians yesterday in one of his most conciliatory speeches yet, saying he was prepared to grant them a state, release desperately needed funds and free prisoners if they choose the path of peace. Olmert's announcement followed a cabinet meeting in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Sde Boker on the annual memorial day for Israel's first prime minister, David Ben Gurion. Palestinian legislator Saeb Erekat, a top aide to moderate President Mahmoud Abbas, said Palestinians were ready to negotiate a final peace deal. But the Palestinian cabinet, led by Hamas militants who reject Israel's right to exist, accused Olmert of posturing.; Photo: Fatih Saribas, Reuters , TURKEY Pope Benedict, who arrives in Turkey today on a controversial visit, will enjoy tighter security than that accorded U.S. President George W. Bush in 2004. Some 3,000 police have been assigned to guard the Pope -- who angered Muslims worldwide with comments in September on Islam and violence -- on his arrival in the capital of Ankara. Police are also staking out spots in Istanbul, including St. Esprit Cathedral (the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit) shown here, where Benedict is expected to conduct a mass. Armoured vehicles and riot police will also be stationed near the areas the Pope is scheduled to visit during his four days in Turkey.; Photo: Javier Galeano, the Associated Press , CUBA Troops are massing for a huge parade in Havana, and guests are arriving from around the world to celebrate Fidel Castro's delayed birthday party. The only question is whether the ailing guest of honour, who turned 80 on Aug. 13, will appear for any of the five days of festivities starting today, giving clues to his health and ability to resume the power he held for 47 years.; Photo: Shannon Stapleton, Reuters , NEW YORK CITY New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said yesterday that police appeared to use excessive force when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man in a weekend confrontation outside a strip club. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early Saturday after a bachelor party at the club. He was to be married later Saturday. Police, who were investigating alleged prostitution and drug use at the club, said Bell drove his car into an undercover officer and an unmarked police vehicle. Police policy states that officers cannot shoot at a vehicle being used as a weapon if no other deadly force is involved. The five officers involved in the shooting have been placed on paid administrative leave and stripped of their guns during the investigation.; Photo: Ward Perrin, the Canadian Press , VANCOUVER Vancouver-area residents braced for icy temperatures today as they continued to dig out from under a massive weekend snowstorm. Tree limbs downed by heavy snow have left thousands without power. And frustrated commuters faced a repeat of a disastrous morning after leaving their cars at home only to face jammed buses and trains. Forecast temperatures of -12 C to -25 C, put much of the Fraser Valley within frostbite range. Temperatures aren't expected to get above freezing for the rest of the week. The only good news yesterday was the lifting of a boil-water advisory for 900,000 people in the Greater Vancouver area after torrential rains 10 days ago overwhelmed treatment plants.; Photo: David Stonner, the Associated Press , MISSOURI Investigators are treating as suspicious a fire in a group home in Anderson, Missouri, that killed 10 of its mentally ill residents, and injured two dozen others. The dead ranged in age from early 20s to elderly. The blaze that broke out early yesterday stunned the rural community of about 1,800 people tucked in the Ozark hills about 55 kilometres south of Joplin.; Photo: Steve Parsons, the Associated Press , GREAT BRITAIN British Home Secretary John Reid has warned against rushing to conclusions over who might be responsible for the death of Alexander Litvinenko, the former Russian spy turned Kremlin critic. An inquest has begun probing the death from what doctors said was poisoning by polonium 210, a radioactive isotope usually manufactured in specialized nuclear facilities. Three people were being tested for possible radiation exposure as officials began tracking radioactive hotspots in London to trace the poison.; Photo: Mark Baker, the Associated Press , AUSTRALIA Prime Minister John Howard declared himself vindicated yesterday after a probe cleared his government in an Iraqi oil-for-food scandal. But the inquiry urged charges against the nation's wheat exporter for paying more than $200-million US in kickbacks to then Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.</SPAN></P>
