<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angry protesters demanded answers yesterday after a bridegroom was killed by undercover police officers in a hail of 50 bullets as he left his stag party in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was shot dead in the early hours of his wedding day when five officers opened fire at his car in an apparent mix-up outside the Kalua Cabaret strip club in Queens on Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said that undercover officers had been monitoring the club for prostitution. An officer was tipped off that a gunfight was about to break out and followed Mr Bell and his friends outside at about 4am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fight began outside, with Mr Bell and several other men allegedly shouting at someone else. One officer reported that he heard one of the men shout: &quot;Yo, go get my gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An officer followed the men as they got into Mr Bell's car. Mr Bell allegedly drove forward, brushing past the officer, before hitting an unmarked police surveillance van as he turned the corner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police, the first officer, who was in plain clothes, then identified himself and fired the first shot. Mr Bell backed the car into a building, then drove forward into the van again. Officers inside the van then responded, firing 50 shots, 21 of which hit the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, who was due to marry his high-school sweetheart and the mother of his two children later in the day, was fatally hit by two shots to the neck and arm. Two other passengers were also hit. One was left in a critical condition. Police did not recover any weapon from the victims. Although the victims were black, officials rejected accusations of racism.</SPAN></P>
