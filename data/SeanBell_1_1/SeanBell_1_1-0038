<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FIVE COPS INVOLVED IN the fatal shooting of an unarmed bridegroom on his wedding day were put on administrative leave yesterday as prosecutors prepared to take the case to a grand jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new developments came as hundreds of furious protesters, led by the dead man's bride-to-be and his weeping 3-year-old daughter, took to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is like the Wild, Wild West,&quot; said Bishop Lester Williams, who was supposed to preside at the wedding of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to Nicole Paultre. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fifty shots, and no one is shooting back at you? That's an execution. It's like putting them in front of a firing line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, was shot in the neck and killed when plainclothes cops unloaded 50 shots on his Nissan Altima after his bachelor party at a Queens strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His friends, Joseph Guzman, 31, and Trent Benefield, 23, were wounded in the 4 a.m. incident outside the Kalua Cabaret on 94th Ave. in Jamaica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As outrage at the shootings of the three unarmed black men swelled, city officials scrambled to respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard Brown was preparing to present evidence to a grand jury &quot;in the next few days,&quot; a source said. He is to meet this morning with a homicide investigator and the head of his investigations unit to review the Saturday morning bloodshed, the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD, meanwhile, put the five officers who fired on paid administrative leave and asked them to surrender their weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The names of the officers were not released, and none of them have been interviewed by investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg, who spoke to the 22-year-old Paultre on Saturday, has arranged a meeting today with community leaders at City Hall to discuss the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg, believed to have been at his Bermuda home over the weekend, spent yesterday calling or e-mailing black leaders, including Rep. Charles Rangel (D-Harlem), the Rev. Floyd Flake and former Mayor David Dinkins. &quot;He said he was doing everything he could to find out what happened,&quot; City Councilman Leroy Comrie (D-Queens) said of Bloomberg. &quot;He wanted to assure me he was engaged, involved, and that we would get to the bottom of what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New details about the sequence of events emerged yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends of Bell, Benefield and Guzman told cops the trio mistook the plainclothes officers conducting surveillance at the club for robbers and tried to get away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell clipped an undercover officer who was on foot with his car and then twice rammed into the cops' unmarked minivan - and the cops opened fire, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover cop fired the first shot, followed by 10 more rounds, a law enforcement source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A white plainclothes detective who was in the rammed van got out and fired 31 shots, stopping to reload.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second officer in the van fired three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lieutenant overseeing the surveillance operation who was in an unmarked Toyota Camry ducked down behind the dashboard when the first shots rang out, thinking he was under fire, a source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two officers riding with the lieutenant got out of the Camry and opened fire, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One, a 17-year veteran, fired four times, while the other officer, who has nine years on the force, fired once, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the officers are white, two are black and one is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said statements an undercover officer overheard inside the club led police to believe the men were going to retrieve a weapon. No gun was found in Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trini Wright, 28, a dancer at the club, insisted the cops opened fire without identifying themselves. She was planning to go with Bell and his friends to a diner and was putting her makeup bag in the trunk of their car when the cops' minivan appeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The minivan came around the corner and smashed into their car. And they [the cops] jumped out shooting,&quot; Wright told The News. &quot;No 'stop.' No 'freeze.' No nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police were looking for signs of prostitution and drugs at the club when the shooting broke out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But supporters of the three shot men said there was no excuse for what transpired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot allow this to continue to happen,&quot; said the Rev. Al Sharpton outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where Guzman was in critical condition and Benefield was in stable condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to understand that all of us were in that car,&quot; Sharpton told about 300 protesters, who chanted, &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; and counted to 50 to represent the number of shots fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters marched several blocks to the hospital from Community Church of Christ, where a service was held earlier. During the march, Paultre collapsed and had to be supported by people surrounding her.</SPAN></P>
