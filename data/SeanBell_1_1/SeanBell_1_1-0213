<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spray of bullets hit the car 21 times, after the vehicle rammed into an undercover officer and then an unmarked NYPD minivan twice, police said. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly would not say if the collisions were what prompted police to open fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was too early to say whether the shooting was justified, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police thought one of the men in the car might have had a gun. But armed with a search warrant, police found no weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although it is too early to draw conclusions about this mornings shootings ... we know that the NYPD officers on the scene had reason to believe that an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and were trying to stop it,&quot; Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the incident stemmed from an undercover operation inside the strip club. Seven officers in plain clothes were investigating the Kalua Cabaret, and five were involved in the shooting.
