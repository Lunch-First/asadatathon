  Re ''Bloomberg Calls 50 Shots by the Police 'Unacceptable' '' (front page, Nov. 28):
The Bloomberg administration's decision to move away from the past City Hall practice of reflexively defending police shootings is commendable. Knee-jerk defenses of police shootings, no matter what the circumstances, became an art form under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.  
  Those reactions gravely damaged the city's relations with its minority communities and undermined the idea that the police could be investigated fairly. 
  But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has swung too far in the other direction. His snap condemnation of the police in the heated aftermath of Saturday morning's fatal shooting by officers in Queens is wrong for the same reasons the previous administration was wrong to immediately defend the police. 
  Though by any account 
 death is tragic, the facts are not yet in, and no one knows exactly what happened or who, if anyone, is to blame. 
  The mayor should stand up for justice, and let a thorough investigation take its course.Josh HafetzNew Haven, Nov. 28, 2006The writer is a former investigator for the New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board.To the Editor:
  Re ''Badges, Guns and Another Unarmed Victim,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Nov. 30):
  New York's Finest are supposed to be heroes. They are heroes because they are expected to put their lives before the lives of the civilians they are here to protect.
  Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly should carry out a ''do not shoot until fired upon'' policy. No police officer should open fire before being fired upon unless there is clear danger and rock-solid justification for firing.
  Everyone mourns when an officer falls in the line of duty. Police officers deserve all our respect for the sacrifice they are prepared to make for us.
  The word ''hero'' gets passed around too easily these days. It should mean something. Taylor SamuelsBrooklyn, Nov. 30, 2006
