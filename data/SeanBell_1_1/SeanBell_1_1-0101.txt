A record 7 million people -- or one in every 32 American adults -- were behind bars or on probation or parole at the end of last year, according to the Justice Department. 
Of those, 2,193,798 were in prison or jail, an increase of 2.7 percent over the previous year. More than 4.1 million people were on probation, and 784,208 were on parole at the end of 2005.
Men still far outnumber women in prisons and jails, but the female population is growing faster. The population of women in state or federal prison increased 2.6 percent in 2005 while the number of male inmates rose 1.9 percent. By year's end, 7 percent of all inmates were women.
Investigators believe two men -- one of whom may have had a gun -- could hold the key to learning why police unleashed a 50-bullet barrage that killed a groom leaving his bachelor party at a strip club hours before his wedding.
One man was last seen dressed in black, standing in front of a sport-utility vehicle with silver rims and exchanging glares and insults with the groom, 
 The other man was last seen wearing a beige jacket and running away from Bell's car as five officers fired.
The shooting has ignited outrage in New York, and civil rights activists Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton visited the scene of the shooting Wednesday to console the victims' relatives.
