<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Barron. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson, too. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There they were this week, the Ubiquitous Three, comforting the grievingfamily of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - a black man shot dead in Queens by police - for atleast as long as the TV cameras lingered.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a contrast to the scene in Brooklyn Federal Court, where one RonellWilson is on trial in the 2003 murders of NYPD Detectives James Nemorin andRodney Andrews. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Al Sharpton there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Charles Barron. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Jesse Jackson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two detectives had been working undercover to break up a gun-runninggang operating out of a Staten Island housing project. Then a gun-buy wentdisastrously bad, their cover blown - and they were shot dead on the spot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nemorin and Andrews, as it happened, were black. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They died heroes in an effort to keep illegal guns out of a virtuallyall-black Staten Island housing project. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is to say, to save black lives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nemorin left a wife and three children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrews, a wife and two kids. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their families grieved no less than the survivors of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But without Sharpton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without Barron. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without Jackson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No visit paid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not a word of condolence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor has any of the three attended the Wilson trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not surprising, for two reasons: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* To do so would show a modicum of derivative respect for the NYPD. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* And there are no media cameras in that particular courtroom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what would be the point? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton and Barron and Jackson care only about certain dead blackpeople. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They care only about tragedies that present opportunities to sow rancor,and to advance their personal agendas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not news, of course, but it is worth pointing out that thefatherless children of hero cops need a hug, too. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that Sharpton or Barron or Jackson gives a damn.</SPAN></P>
