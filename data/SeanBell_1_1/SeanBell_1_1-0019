<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators believe two mysterious men, one of whom may have had a gun, could hold the key to learning why police unleashed a 50-bullet barrage that killed a groom leaving his bachelor party at a strip club hours before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man was last seen dressed in black, standing in front of a sport utility vehicle with silver rims and exchanging glares and insults with the groom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another man was last seen wearing a beige jacket and running away from Bell's car as five officers fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement officials provided partial descriptions Wednesday of the two missing witnesses and details about their possible roles based on accounts from undercover officers and at least one civilian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an undercover officer, the man in black argued with Bell and his companions as they exited a Queen strip club where Bell was having a bachelor party. The officer was part of a vice team investigating complaints about prostitution and drug dealing at the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, while in front of a black SUV parked outside the club, reached into his pocket as if he had a weapon as Bell challenged him to a fight and one of Bell's companions, Joseph Guzman, said, &quot;Yo, get my gun. Get my gun,&quot; according to the officials, citing the undercover detective's account. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the investigation has not been completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said the exchange prompted a second undercover detective to follow Bell and three other men as they walked away toward their car, apparently suspecting the men meant to arm themselves and attack the man in black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later, the second undercover started shooting at the car when Bell, while trying to drive away, bumped him and smashed into an unmarked police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the victims, Trent Benefield, told police Bell became spooked and tried to take off because he didn't know the undercover cop was a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting has ignited outrage in New York, and civil rights activists Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton visited the scene of the shooting yesterday to console the victims' relatives.</SPAN></P>
