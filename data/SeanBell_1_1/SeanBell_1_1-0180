<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN INQUIRY was under way last night after New York police shot dead a bridegroom and injured two of his friends when officers opened fire on their vehicle at the end of stag-night visit to a strip club. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, died in a hail of bullets after police fired 50 rounds at his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His two passengers were critically injured after being hit multiple times during the shooting in the early hours of Saturday morning prompted after the stag-night revellers struck a police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Guzman, 31, was hit 11 times and Trent Benefield, 23, three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three were found to be unarmed and the incident has provoked an outcry from their families and community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, who has two babies, aged three and five months, had been due to get married hours later that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His fiancEe, instead of getting married in front of 250 people, spent the weekend at the bedside of the injured men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting took place after an undercover operation at a lap-dancing club called Kalua Cabaret in the borough of Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven officers were staking out the club which was under investigation for drugs and prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed one of the undercover police overhead a remark 'get my gun' from one of the trio inside the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three men later got into a car and as Mr Bell was driving away he struck an officer on foot it is thought by accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The car backed up onto the pavement and hit a police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers then jumped out and opened fire .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One, a veteran of the NYPD, fired his 9mm handgun 31 times, emptying two magazines. Some of the bullets hit nearby houses and a train station, but no passers-by were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said police had feared for their lives. He added that they thought a gunfight was about to take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, civil rights activist, Reverend Al Sharpton, said: 'This stinks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something about the story being told does not seem right.' New York police commissioner Raymond Kelly has confirmed an investigation had been launched into the shooting.</SPAN></P>
