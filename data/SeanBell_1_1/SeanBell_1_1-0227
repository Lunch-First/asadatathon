<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEAUTIFUL comic timing at the Scottish Labour Conference, where nedbuster-in chief Cathy Jamieson demands petty criminals face New York-style justice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the weekend when Big Apple cops blasted 50 bullets into a dad-of-two as he drove home from his stag party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> died and two mates were seriously wounded because officers believed firearms were about to be used and were trying to stop it happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the victims - who had crashed into an unmarked police van - were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems more likely they'd simply driven drunk and had a prang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Idiots? Course they were. Irresponsible? Undoubtedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But did they deserve to die? Was their fate justice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not a chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Mrs Nedbuster wasn't suggesting for a minute our own jakeys should get a cap in their ass. She was talking more about community sentences like the one that saw Boy George sweeping the New York streets for taking drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after a trigger-happy tragedy like the one that left two kiddies fatherless, maybe it's the last city we should be looking to for any advice.</SPAN></P>
