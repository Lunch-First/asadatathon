POLICE opened fire on a car full of men driving away from a bachelor party at a strip club, killing the groom on his wedding day after an undercover cop was rammed with the car.
Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said it was too early to say whether the shooting early today -- 50 rounds were fired, hitting the vehicle 21 times -- was justified. The deadly incident stemmed from an undercover operation inside the club, Kelly said.
Kelly said the car also rammed into an unmarked police minivan. Seven officers in plain clothes were involved in the incident, but only five fired.
The groom was identified as 
 23.
