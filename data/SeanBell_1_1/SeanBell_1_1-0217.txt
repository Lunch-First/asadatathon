A groom-to-be was killed on his wedding day yesterday when cops fired approximately 50  rounds at him and two 
friends as they left a bachelor party at a notorious strip club in Jamaica, Queens. The friends and families of 
 23, and his fiance, Nicole Paultre (above), who were to be married, are demanding answers from the NYPD.
