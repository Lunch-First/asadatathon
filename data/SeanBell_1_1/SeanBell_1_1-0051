<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A brothel on the second floor led authorities to close the club in July 2005 for prostitution and underage drinking, but the nightspot was able to reopen just three months later, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The topless joint in Jamaica, Queens, was raided in March as part of a prostitution crackdown, sources said. Just last Tuesday, cops made more arrests for drugs and prostitution, cops said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops have been called to the club 26 times this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two undercover vice cops from Manhattan were in Kalua early yesterday, gathering evidence of prostitution for the city's effort to close the club under New York's nuisance abatement program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They needed one more arrest to prove their case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the undercover officers got tipped to the potential of a gunfight and tailed former high school baseball star </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his buddies out of the club. One of the two undercovers was among the five cops involved in the fatal shooting, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, the club was guarded by several cops and secured behind crime scene tape.</SPAN></P>
