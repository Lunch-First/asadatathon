MICHAEL Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, described the police shooting of three unarmed men that left a bridegroom dead on his wedding day as "unacceptable or inexplicable'' yesterday and pledged a "fair and thorough investigation'' of the incident. 
Mr Bloomberg, who was in Bermuda when the shooting occurred on Saturday, returned to growing demands for an explanation as to why police fired 50 shots in under 30 seconds at the men's car as they left a strip club in Queens that they had visited for a stag party. The mayor said he was "deeply disturbed'' by the barrage of gunfire.
 23, the driver, who was due to marry later that day, died after being hit in the neck and shoulder. He had been to the Kalua Cabaret, which undercover officers were investigating for suspected firearms and underage prostitution offences. Two other men in the car were wounded, one critically.
The shooting began after an officer investigating the club fired at the car when the men tried to run him down.
According to some witness reports, the officer's shots passed through the car, convincing police on the other side of the vehicle that they were being shot at and prompting them to return fire. Raymond Kelly, the New York police commissioner, said 50 rounds were fired in a few seconds, 31 by one of the five officers involved. It was thought that the men in the car were armed after one was heard yelling outside the club "Get my gun'', he said, but no weapon was recovered.
Mr Bloomberg met community leaders yesterday and called for calm. "It is unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired,'' Mr Bloomberg said.
The officers involved have been placed on administrative leave while the district attorney investigates if criminal charges will be brought.
Nicole Paultre, Mr Bell's fiancee and the mother of his two daughters, visited the shooting scene yesterday.
