U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney has added her voice to a growing chorus of prominent Americans concerned about a spate of high-profile police shootings, including one that killed a New York man the day of his wedding. 
The congresswoman has asked the Justice Department to investigate police-involved shootings around the nation, including in her home district of DeKalb County, where police have fatally shot a dozen people this year.
"There is a belief by some citizens that the police-involved shootings are steeped in the intentional use of excessive force, even deadly force," McKinney said in a Nov. 25 letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez. "There definitely appears to be a developing national pattern of police misconduct and abuse resulting in an inordinately high number of serious injuries and deaths to the victims."
McKinney has also asked the House Judiciary Committee to conduct hearings on "the state of America's law enforcement agencies' use of force and deadly force and the impact on Americans on the basis of race and economic standing," her letter said.
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Monday that the shooting early Saturday of three unarmed men, in which 50 bullets were fired, was "unacceptable." 
 who died in the shooting, was to have been married later that day.
