THE furious crowd was cautioned not to forget the lessons learned from the case of Amadou Diallo.  
"The idea is to show we're with the family, not that the family is with us," the Rev. Al Sharpton said to the several hundred people gathered at the Community Church of Christ in Jamaica, Queens, yesterday.   
"This is their burden. We are here to help them and to support them, and if you're so mad that you can't do it, then step back."  
Sharpton was urging supporters to remain level-headed in their protests against the cops who fatally gunned down an unarmed 

 23, a dad of two, on his wedding day Saturday.  
Sharpton said the community must avoid any behavior that could taint a jury pool if a case against the officers is brought to trial.  
He reminded them of Diallo, who was killed in The Bronx in February 1999, when cops fired 41 shots at him after he reached for a wallet they mistook for a gun.  
The venue in that case was changed to Albany, where the police officers involved were eventually acquitted.  
Bell's mourners remembered that case as they clasped the silver-bell party favors from a wedding that never was.  
Still in shock, Bell's bride-to-be, Nicole Paultre, asked pastor Lester Williams, who was supposed to marry the couple, if he could perform the ceremony anyway so that she could fulfill her promise to Bell and their two small daughters. Williams could not.  
So yesterday, Nicole followed through on another promise: She joined the church. But not before telling Jada, 3, that Daddy was gone.  
When Sean was alive, he had to console Jada about the death of a puppy, Williams said.  
"He always told Jada, 'When you see the sun, you'll see the puppy,' " Williams said.  
"We had to tell her that Daddy was taking care of the puppy."
