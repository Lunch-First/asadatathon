<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael Bloomberg met yesterday with the family and fiancee of an unarmed black man killed by police gunfire outside a New York strip club on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 50-bullet police volley - compared to a &quot;firing squad&quot; by the Rev Al Sharpton - killed 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after his bachelor party, wounded two of his friends and ignited concerns over police tactics. The three men were unarmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg went to the family's church in the borough of Queens and met with Bell's fiancee and father, and with Sharpton, a prominent civil rights leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor then met again with other community leaders at a restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor stood by his comments at a news conference that it was &quot;unacceptable or inexplicable&quot; how police could have fired 50-odd shots, but an investigation would determine what really happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seemed to me the number of shots fired, as I said, was excessive,&quot; he said. &quot;I wasn't there, maybe it will turn out to be not excessive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg said yesterday that he was steadfast in his support for Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, despite demands from some community leaders that he step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the victims, Bloomberg said: &quot;There is no evidence that they were doing anything wrong,&quot; referring to what led up to the moment their car struck an undercover officer outside the nightclub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard A Brown said his office was investigating the Saturday morning shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of Bell's friends were wounded after Bell's bachelor party at the strip club. The victims were black. The five police officers who fired shots included two blacks, two whites and one Hispanic. The undercover operation at the Kalua Cabaret club was part of a citywide crackdown sparked by the case of a New Jersey teenager who was abducted, raped and killed following a night of partying earlier this year at a Manhattan nightclub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said they had received several complaints about prostitution and drug dealing at the club in Queens before sending in two undercover detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation began to unravel when one of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officers alerted the back-up team outside that a man inside was possibly armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the undercover detectives retrieved his weapon and confronted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell and his friends in their car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly suggested it was unorthodox for the officer to blow his cover rather than rely on other officers to make the arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union officials insist the detective identified himself and ordered the men to stop before the car, driven by Bell, lurched forward and bumped him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vehicle then smashed into an unmarked police van, backed up and smashed the van again before the shooting began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre, branded the officers &quot;murderers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Guzman, 31, was shot at least 11 times, Trent Benefield, 23, was hit three times. Guzman was in critical condition and Benefield in a stable condition yesterday.</SPAN></P>
