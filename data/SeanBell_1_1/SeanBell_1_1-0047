<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of New York was stunned yesterday after police officers shot dead an unarmed man on his wedding day as he left his stag night at a strip club. Officers fired about 50 rounds at a car in which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his friends were travelling after the vehicle crashed into an unmarked police van.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bell, 23, who was driving, was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital after being shot in the neck, arm and shoulder. He had been due to wed the mother of his two young daughters hours later. Instead, Nicole Paultre, 22, was driven to a New York hospital to identify the body of her high school sweetheart. Two other men in the car were also hit, one 11 times. Raymond Kelly, the New York police commissioner, said it was too early to say if the shooting was justified. The district attorney's office is investigating. The incident stemmed from an undercover police operation inside the Kalua Cabaret, a strip club in Queens, Mr. Kelly said. The club, which had a &quot;chronic history of narcotics, prostitution and weapons complaints,&quot; was one violation away from being shut down. At around 4 a.m., there was an altercation outside the club in which one man was heard shouting: &quot;Yo, get my gun.&quot; Police followed a group of men as they got into a car and drove off. It was thought they were armed, Mr. Kelly said, but no weapons were found.</SPAN></P>
