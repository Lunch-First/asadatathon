COPS fired 50 bullets at a car full of unarmed men on a stag night visit to a strip club, killing the groom on his wedding day. 
The shooting by New York police has sparked fury in the city.
A spray of bullets hit the car 21 times, after the vehicle rammed into an undercover officer and then an unmarked police minivan.
The groom, who was driving, was identified as dad-of-two 
 23. He was set to wed fiancee Nicole Paultre.
Front-seat passenger Joseph Guzman, 31, who is in a critical condition in hospital, was shot at least 11 times, while Trent Benefield, 23, a passenger in the back seat, was hit three times. Police chief Raymond Kelly said the officers were at the Kalua Cabaret club to "document illicit activity".
He admitted that one veteran officer fired 31 shots, emptying two full magazines.
City mayor Michael Bloomberg said: "Officers on the scene had reason to believe that an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and were trying to stop it."
No guns were found in the car.
The shooting drew angry protests from family members and civil rights leader the Rev Al Sharpton.
He said: "How does one justify 50 shots at unarmed men?"
