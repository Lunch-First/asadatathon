<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was an odd moment in the aftermath of the police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Rev. Al Sharpton posing with Mayor Bloomberg before TV cameras at a City Hall press conference but then bolting before the first word was uttered.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg explained Sharpton's hasty departure Monday by saying the reverend had to rush to a meeting with the victim's family.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Sharpton hadn't wanted to attend the press conference at all - but was persuaded by the mayor to put in a brief appearance, sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Sharpton at his side, Bloomberg could demonstrate that he had reached out to the most fiery critic of the NYPD.       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by leaving early, Sharpton avoided putting himself in an awkward situation where he might have to publicly disagree with the mayor, whom some had expected to defend the police.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the press conference, Sharpton attended a meeting set up by the mayor with community and elected officials.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One participant said Sharpton &quot;turned to [Police Commissioner Ray] Kelly and said, 'I've got good news and bad news. The good news is, I still support you being commissioner. The bad news is, most commissioners I support end up getting fired.' &quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that point, state Sen. Malcolm Smith declared that it was up to everyone to maintain peace in the community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton responded by saying: &quot;You invited me into your house. I'm not going to kick the chandelier.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Sharpton, representing the Bell family, who first reached out to the administration Saturday - not the other way around, say insiders.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rev. Sharpton has played an excellent role in this process,&quot; Deputy Mayor Dennis Walcott told The Post. </SPAN></P>
