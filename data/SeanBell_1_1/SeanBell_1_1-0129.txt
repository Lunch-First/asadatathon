Maryland freshman Greivis Vasquez wasn't bothered by Illinois' loud homecourt that has been intimidating to visiting nonconference schools for 8 years.
Tuning out the orange-clad partisans, Vasquez and teammate Mike Jones led No. 23 Maryland to a 72-66 win last night, ending Illinois' 51-game nonconference winning streak at Assembly Hall.
"I'm not afraid. I'm ready for this," Vasquez said after scoring 15 of his 17 points in the second half as the Terps recovered after blowing a 15-point lead. 
"I'm from Venezuela, and I didn't come here just to sit on the bench. I came here to play," Vasquez said.
Vasquez' steal and layup with 1:22 left to play gave the Terps the 65-60 lead.
With Jones scoring 19 and Vasquez playing like an experienced veteran, Maryland was able to overcome the absence of shot blocker and rebounder Ekene Ibekwe, who sat out with an ankle injury. The Terps' 8-0 start is their best since the 1988-89 team won its first 10.
"It should have been closer in the second half than it was," Illinois (7-1) coach Bruce Weber said. "Then in the second half, we didn't grab it."
