HUNDREDS RALLY
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg today moved to defuse public anger over the shooting death of an apparently unarmed black man by five officers.
 23, was shot dead hours before his wedding on Saturday as he left his bachelor party in a Queens nightclub being staked out by police.
Fifty shots were fired at the group, killing Bell and wounding two friends, one critically.
As hundreds rallied in Queens yesterday, Bloomberg appealed to police and community leaders to keep the calm.
