<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - A column called &quot;Ask a Mexican&quot; began as a one-time feature - written with tongue only partly in-cheek - by staff writer Gustavo Arellano for the OC Weekly in Orange County, Calif. It became a surprise hit and very popular continuing column. Judging by some of my own mail, I'm not surprised. In fact, I have long wanted to write a similar column and call it &quot;Ask a Black Man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now is probably as good a time as any. People have questions about other people in our diverse society and it's often hard to find answers without worrying about offending somebody. Recent racial eruptions seem to have left some with so many questions and confusion that they are even willing to turn to a newspaper columnist for answers. For example: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Page:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is it when blacks use the word &quot;nigger&quot; there is no outcry? If you're offended by Michael Richards' use of this word, how do you feel when you are sitting in your car waiting for the light to change and the radio in a car next to you is blaring this word, and worse, the driver's kids are in the car? I guess it's only wrong if a nonblack uses the word. Both parties are wrong, but like we would say when we were kids, &quot;Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names can never hurt me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sincerely,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed L., Honolulu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Ed:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good points. And &quot;aloha,&quot; Honolulu. Be careful, however, about what you say to that guy in the next car or you might get your own bones broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But seriously, the Rev. Jesse Jackson is trying to extend the legs of the controversy stirred up when Michael &quot;Kramer&quot; Richards of Seinfeld fame hurled the N-word at hecklers. Jackson has called on all entertainers and everyone else to stop using the word. Frankly, I don't expect much. The late, great comedian Richard Pryor turned against the word quite convincingly after using it so liberally in the 1970s. Pryor's condemnation of the word hasn't caught on yet, either, although I am always ready to be pleasantly surprised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Mr. Page:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black-on-black crime (especially murder) is such a huge and rampant reality in this country, but God forbid a policeman might make a mistake and hurt or kill a black thug and they're ready to loot and riot at the drop of a hat. The question is: Can you make sense of this African-American hypocrisy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M.D., Chicago</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear M.D.:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am often asked why so many black Americans still support the Rev. Jesse Jackson or the Rev. Al Sharpton, even though their tactics seem mostly to be stuck in the 1960s. I find my answer in wire stories like this recent dispatch from New York City: &quot;The morning 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was shot to death by police, his grieving relatives did something that has become almost routine in such cases: They called the Rev. Al Sharpton. Within hours, the longtime civil-rights activist had consoled relatives, held two news conferences, and begun organizing a community rally for the next day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, just ask yourself: If police shot your son to death before his wedding and wounded two friends after firing 50 shots into their car and there was no gun found in their car, whom would you call?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Mr. Page:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I found it interesting that ESPN found an obscene gesture by Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick after the game Sunday to be offensive enough to blur it out. Did you notice this was not done with Mr. Richards' actions? So help me understand why you as well as other journalists and broadcasters have not written one sentence to crucify his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks for your time,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fred T.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Fred:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You're welcome, but I don't do sports. Besides, in the entertainment industry known as professional football, stars don't get stigmatized easily for affronts to mere decency. They have to blow a lot of touchdowns first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Mr. Page:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may very well be that Mr. Richards is not a racist, if you consider a racist to be someone who harbors negative perceptions about and feelings toward anyone and everyone from a certain race. A likely scenario is that Mr. Richards realized from the lack of audience response that his act was not going over well, was thus already uptight and flew into a rage when heckled. I could be wrong, but I can't help thinking that if his hecklers had been two overweight white folks, he would have burst into an expletive-laden monologue about Moby Dick, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Best wishes,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phil from Libertyville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Phil:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, but I don't think being called a big, fat whale carries quite the same sting.</SPAN></P>
