<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AWAY FROM the loud calls for justice and the political haggling over his son's death at the hands of police, William Bell is waiting for a phone call. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You would think they would come to me,&quot; he said yesterday, referring to Mayor Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. &quot;Me and my wife brought this kid onto the Earth. I'm the father and you don't have the decency to come and talk to me?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed in a hail of bullets fired by five cops, William Bell and his family reluctantly have become thrust into the spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre; her parents, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> uncle joined forces with civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton at meetings yesterday with the Queens district attorney, Bell's parents stayed in their Cambria Heights, Queens, home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The devastated dad said that his family's grief has been put on display by well-meaning activists and leaders - but their basic needs have not been addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's more about politics than human life. I don't want no mass destruction. I want things to be peaceful but I want answers,&quot; he said in his first public comments since the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killing, on the morning of his wedding day, has mobilized civic leaders to question the police procedures that led five cops to blast 50 shots at the groom's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All you see is the politicians, but they didn't lose. I lost,&quot; William Bell said. &quot;Rev. Sharpton has been doing this a long time. I admire the man for what he is doing but what about me, my wife and my family?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell wants the murky details about his son's encounter with the cops made clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They took his life. And now they are beating around the bush with this. What are they trying to do?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grieving father doesn't trust the police version of events and is hopeful a fair investigation will be conducted. But he said what bothers him most is the lack of sympathy he sees from Kelly and Bloomberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Say 'I'm sorry and I'm trying to figure out what is going on.' But it's like they don't care,&quot; he said. &quot;Instead, they are protecting the cops involved. They care more about these five people. They are walking around but my son is dead,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
