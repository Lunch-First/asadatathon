TEARS ROLLED down the cheek of Jada Bell yesterday, telling of the sadness and confusion a little girl feels when she learns her daddy won't be coming home. 
The 3-year-old daughter of 
 is too young to understand how he died in a hail of 50 police bullets Saturday morning.
Her family had to explain the loss to her in the simplest and most heartbreaking of terms.
"The hardest part is that Jada still wants her father," said Bishop Lester Williams, who was supposed to preside at the wedding of Jada's parents.
He said that when Jada's puppy died recently, her dad told her to look to the sky, explaining, "When you see the sun, that's the puppy."
"This morning, we had to tell her, 'Daddy is taking care of the puppy. Look up and say hi to Daddy,'" Williams said.
Jada's mother, Nicole Paultre, was also having difficulty grasping the tragedy that left her alone, walking through the streets to ask for justice instead of celebrating her first day of marriage.
"They are in shock, extreme shock," Williams said. "The young lady called me and said, 'Can I still be married?'"
Bell was killed after his bachelor party at a Queens strip club, just hours before he was supposed to be married to Paultre.
Relatives said he was planning to move his family to Georgia once he tied the knot. Bell's cousin Kinglarry Crawford, 35, said Paultre's father was going to buy the newlyweds a home in Atlanta.
Bell, who had worked various jobs, including one as a UPS driver, wanted to raise two children in a quiet place with more opportunities, he said.
"Everybody is devastated," Crawford added. "He is the first person in this family to be murdered."
