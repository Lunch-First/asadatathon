NEW York City police opened fire on a car full of men driving away from a bachelor party at a strip club, killing the groom on his wedding day after an undercover officer was rammed with the car.
Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said it was too early to say whether the shooting was justified. At least 50 rounds were fired, hitting the vehicle 21 times.
The incident stemmed from an undercover operation inside the club.
Mr Kelly said the car rammed an unmarked police minivan. Seven officers were involved.
The groom was identified as 
 23.
The shooting drew angry protests from family members and the Reverend Al Sharpton, a black civil rights leader.
