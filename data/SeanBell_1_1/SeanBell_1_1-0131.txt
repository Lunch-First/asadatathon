DeMarcus Nelson scored 19 Tuesday night as No. 11 Duke held on to beat Indiana 54-51 in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge.
Freshman Jon Scheyer had 10 points for the Blue Devils (6-1), who extended their nonconference home winning streak to 45 games and remained the only unbeaten team in the challenge's eight-year history. Hall of Fame coach Mike Krzyzewski earned his 759th career win, tying Western Kentucky's Ed Diddle for 10th all time.
Freshman Armon Bassett scored 16 to lead the Hoosiers (3-2), who were down 12 at halftime and had to fight for just about every basket but still put a scare into the Blue Devils. 
Duke led 53-46 on Scheyer's 3-pointer with 5:01 left, but that was its last field goal. The Hoosiers cut it to 53-51 on Bassett's drive with 2:04 left.
Then, after Gerald Henderson's free throw, the Hoosiers had two late chances to tie. On the first, Bassett airballed a 3-pointer that went out of bounds to Duke. But Errek Suhr stole Josh McRoberts' inbounds for Nelson with 9.3 seconds left, giving the Hoosiers possession.
Indiana managed only a leaning 3 from Suhr that fell short of the rim as the horn sounded.
