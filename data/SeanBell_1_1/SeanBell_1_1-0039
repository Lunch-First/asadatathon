<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMADOU DIALLO'S mother learned of the latest NYPD shooting in the most ironic of settings: an East Village screening of a documentary about her son's 1999 death at the hands of city cops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was hoping that after all these years of speaking and marching and protesting to ask about the end of police shootings - like my son was killed - that we would never see such a thing again,&quot; Kadiatou Diallo said yesterday about Saturday's shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the reason why people should not forget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She vowed to join with protesters calling for a thorough investigation of the police shooting of Bell and his two friends, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, who remain hospitalized. The three unarmed men were shot by cops outside a Queens strip club after a bachelor party for Bell, who was to be married Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They stood with us for Amadou. I will join the community to join our common voices,&quot; said Diallo, who lives in Maryland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amadou Diallo was 22 when he was shot to death Feb. 4, 1999, by cops who fired 41 bullets as he stood, unarmed, in the doorway of his Bronx apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops were acquitted of all criminal charges by an Albany jury, but the city later paid the Diallo family $3 million to settle a wrongful death lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadiatou Diallo was at Anthology Archives on Saturday afternoon to speak about the documentary, &quot;Death of Two Sons,&quot; when a member of the audience told her about Bell's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movie, directed by Micah Schaffer and shown as part of the African Diaspora Film Festival, delves into Amadou Diallo's slaying and the car-crash death of Peace Corps volunteer Jesse Thyne, an American who lived with Diallo's family in Guinea, Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a mother who lost a son in a police shooting, I think this is unbearable,&quot; she said yesterday. &quot;It's so sad to see this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she regretted not being able to participate in the rallies across the city yesterday, and planned to contact the Rev. Al Sharpton to lend her support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She called on police to take responsibility for their actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NYPD also needs to be reminded that we thank them for the wonderful job they are doing, but they have to help us,&quot; Diallo said. &quot;This is why we need to raise awareness, until people at large in all communities will have good policing without killing people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
