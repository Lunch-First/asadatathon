<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON (AP) - A former tire plant worker's complaint that she was paid thousands of dollars less than men in the same job made it to the Supreme Court Monday in a case that could affect pay discrimination claims nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The justices engaged in a lively but inconclusive debate over how to apply a 180-day deadline for complaining about discriminatory pay decisions under Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lilly Ledbetter sued Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., claiming that after 19 years at the company's Gadsden, Ala., plant, she was making $6,000 a year less than the lowest-paid man in the same job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists offer insights into death of King Tut</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO (MCT) - When Egyptian scientists performed the first CT scan of the mummy of Tutankhamun, they turned up a key clue: Bone fragments from the pharaoh's first vertebra, near the skull, were not coated with embalming fluid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the fragments were clean at the breaks, meaning that the damage had to have occurred after the pharaoh's remains were prepared for burial. The evidence seems to rule out a blow to the base of the skull as the cause of Tut's death, a theory in play ever since X-rays of the boy king were taken in 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's likely the bones broke when Englishman Howard Carter and his team rough-handled the mummy after they discovered it in 1922, said Dr. Ashraf Selim, who reported the first detailed findings from the scans Monday at the Radiological Society of North America's annual meeting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JERUSALEM (AP) - Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reached out to the Palestinians on Monday in one of his most conciliatory speeches yet, saying he was prepared to grant them a state, release desperately needed funds and free prisoners if they choose peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olmert's remarks sealed a dramatic policy shift and built on a day-old truce meant to end five months of violence in the Gaza Strip. But new rocket attacks by Palestinian militants threatened the latest rapprochement.</SPAN></P>
