<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A natural gas leak was suspected as the cause of the blast just after noon, though there were no complaints of gas odors before the blast and no work crews were in the area, said Columbia Gas spokesman Matt Pitzarella. Gas service to homes near the explosion was shut off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blast was felt a mile away and sent debris through the walls of some of the other homes, police and neighbors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Castle is about 45 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Henry and Jared Baker, both in their early 30s, were hospitalized, Henry in critical condition and Baker in serious condition, a hospital spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MURDER SUSPECT RUNS THROUGH SCHOOL: A murder suspect ran through an elementary school Monday in Columbis, S.C., as he fled police trying to arrest him, and schools in the area were locked down while officers tried to find him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was inside Watkins-Nance Elementary School only briefly, entering through the front and running out a rear door, Richland County sheriff's spokesman Chris Cowan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police didn't know whether the man was armed, but he was considered dangerous, Cowan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers had gone to a nearby house with arrest warrants for two men wanted in a killing during an apparent robbery at a motel last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAYOR BELIEVES POLICE USED EXCESSIVE FORCE: Mayor Michael Bloomberg weighed in Monday on the uproar over a deadly police shooting in New York, saying bluntly that officers appeared to use excessive force when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man in a confrontation outside a strip club hours before his wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened,&quot; Bloomberg said at a news conference after meeting with elected officials and community leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton and Rep. Charles Rangel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early Saturday after a bachelor party at the strip club. Suspecting that one of the men had a gun, police fired 50 rounds into the vehicle. The men were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DELIBERATIONS START IN SMUGGLING CASE: A jury began deliberating Monday in Houston to determine the fate of a truck driver whom a prosecutor called &quot;vile and heartless&quot; for his role in the nation's deadliest human smuggling attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tyrone Williams is being retried in the deaths of 19 illegal immigrants who prosecutors say were among more than 70 illegal immigrants stuffed into his sweltering trailer. They said he ignored their pleas for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people did not have to die. There is only one reason they're dead, and he sits right over there,&quot; Assistant U.S. attorney Daniel Rodriguez said in closing arguments. He pointed at Williams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Craig Washington said that Williams is guilty only of transporting illegal immigrants and that he had no idea people were dying in the trailer and never meant them any harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORLD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCE FOUND IN OFFICES: Traces of the radioactive substance responsible for the death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko have been found in two downtown London offices, and three people who aren't feeling well have been referred for tests to determine if they might also have been exposed, officials said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Secretary John Reid, speaking in the House of Commons, called for calm during the investigation of the death of Litvinenko, 43, who died Thursday from exposure to radioactive polonium 210.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reid said that about 500 people have called government hotlines established following Litvinenko's death, and that only &quot;a small number&quot; had been referred for testing as a &quot;very precautionary measure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PALESTINIAN LEADER DELAYS FIRST TRIP: Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, of Hamas, has postponed a tour of Muslim countries because of Israeli travel restrictions, his office said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haniyeh planned the tour, which was to have begun today, in part to help replenish his government's empty coffers. It was to have been his first trip abroad since the militantly anti-Israel Hamas took office in March, provoking crushing international economic sanctions on the Palestinian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trip was delayed after Israel said security conditions didn't permit Europeans monitoring the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt to cross from Israel into Gaza, the European mission and Palestinian officials said. Without the monitors, the passage doesn't operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BLAIR SORROWFUL ABOUT SLAVE TRADE: British Prime Minister Tony Blair condemned the African slave trade and expressed deep sorrow Monday for his country's role - but stopped short of offering an apology or compensation for the descendants of those victimized by it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activists are pressuring Britain to offer an apology - and reparations - for its role in slavery before it marks the 200th anniversary of the law that banned the country's participation in the Atlantic slave trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blair wrote in an article in the New Nation newspaper that it was right to recognize the active role Britain once played in the trafficking of human beings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES - Pamela Anderson and Kid Rock each filed divorce papers Monday seeking to end their marriage of less than four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson's representative wouldn't comment on the reason or any particulars of the divorce. Anderson and Rock, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, each cited &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; in their divorce filings in Los Angeles County Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, it's true,&quot; Anderson wrote in a brief statement on her Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A message left with Ritchie's attorney wasn't immediately returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relationship between Anderson, 39, and Ritchie, 35, has been a turbulent one since 2002. 1520 - Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan reached the Pacific Ocean after passing through the South American strait.</SPAN></P>
