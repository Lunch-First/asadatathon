<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Revs. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson joined about two dozen grievingfamily and friends yesterday for a memorial at the spot where cops unloaded50 bullets at three men leaving a bachelor party at a Queens club, killingthe groom.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicole Paultre, the fianc&eacute;e of slain </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, stood silently,dressed all in black, her eyes concealed behind sunglasses and tearsstreaking down her cheeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mourners lit votive candles, prayed and hung angry signs of protestagainst police brutality across the street from where bullet holes stillremained in parked cars. One sign read, &quot;Off the pigs who shoot our kids.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We come this morning with the family in their hour of grief,&quot; saidSharpton, standing near a makeshift altar of flowers and candles near theKalua Cabaret strip club in Jamaica. &quot;We're all family now. Not a blackfamily, not a white family, not a Latino family - a human family.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These days are days of mourning. We appeal to the people, don't doanything disruptive or anything contrary to the memory of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's aunt, Diane Shepherd-Oliver, prayed for his soul with an emotionalwail. &quot;I know my nephew is with you, oh, Lord,&quot; she said. &quot;I know Sean isin a better place.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, she said the pain of losing him was &quot;beyond words,&quot; and what stillechoes through her mind is the haunting &quot;screech&quot; her sister Valerie -Sean's mother - made over the phone when she told her about the tragedy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activists once again called for a thorough investigation of theshooting, which they called a civil-rights violation. A funeral service isscheduled for tomorrow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Business will not go on as usual until we get justice for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sharpton said. &quot;We will be shopping for justice while people go shoppingfor the holidays. There is going to be a big shopping spree for justice.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there will be a &quot;mass movement&quot; after the funeral, but refused toelaborate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson linked the shooting to the cases of Haitian immigrant AbnerLouima, who was sodomized in a Brooklyn police station in 1997; AmadouDiallo, the unarmed Guinean immigrant who died in a hail of police gunfirein The Bronx in 1999; and Kathryn Johnston, 88, who was killed by cops inAtlanta a week ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I say to the families here today, don't let even this break yourspirit. Don't be silent, don't betray justice with silence,&quot; said Jackson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our criminal-justice system has broken down for black Americans andyoung black males. We've marched and march, bled too profusely and died tooyoung. We must draw a line in the sand and fight back.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are plans for another rally at the strip club on Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer put out a jointstatement yesterday saying: &quot;This tragedy has deeply saddened New Yorkers -and all Americans. It is of utmost importance that the investigatingauthorities, led by the Queens district attorney, conduct an aggressive,impartial investigation to ferret out the facts.&quot; </SPAN></P>
