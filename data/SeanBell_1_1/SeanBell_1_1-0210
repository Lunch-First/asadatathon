<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rocket fire from Gaza died down Sunday after a daybreak cease-fire, raising hopes for an end to five months of bloody destruction and a new opening toward peace talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surprise truce was supposed to take effect at 6 a.m., but in the four hours that followed, 11 rockets were fired from Gaza at Israeli towns and villages and some Palestinian militants threatened to keep up the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel did not retaliate, saying it wanted to give the truce a chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rivals Hamas and Fatah, the two main factions in the Palestinian government, also publicly backed the truce and by nightfall, it appeared to take hold.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">NEW YORK</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c8">NYC shooting questioned</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An angry crowd demanded Sunday to know why police officers killed an unarmed man on the day of his wedding, firing dozens of shots that also wounded two of the man's friends. Some called for the ouster of the city's police commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a vigil and rally the day after 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was supposed to have married the mother of his two young children, a crowd led by the Rev. Al Sharpton shouted &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Browne, chief spokesman for the NYPD, said Sunday: &quot;We are continuing to look for additional witnesses to shed light on the incident, and assisting the district attorney's office with its investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five offers were placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation, Browne said.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">LONDON</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c8">Poisoning causes friction</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A British Cabinet minister accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of &quot;attacks on individual liberty and on democracy&quot; and said Sunday that relations with Moscow were strained after a former KGB agent was poisoned to death in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Hain, the government's Northern Ireland Secretary, said Putin's tenure had been clouded by incidents &quot;including an extremely murky murder of the senior Russian journalist&quot; Anna Politkovskaya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British officials have so far avoided blaming Moscow for Litvinenko's death and Hain did not comment directly on the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But opposition leaders demanded Sunday that the government explain what it knows about the poisoning and, in particular, how the deadly nuclear material used to poison the 43-year-old Litvinenko found its way into Britain.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">KABUL, Afghanistan</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c8">15 killed in suicide attack</SPAN><BR></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akhpelwak said the attacker, who was Pakistani, was believed to be targeting the special forces commander and the district chief, who were at the restaurant and were among the injured.
