<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journey home at the end of the long Thanksgiving weekend was smooth sailing for many travelers Sunday as the weather cooperated and more people had scheduled their flights to avoid the rush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travelers across most of the nation had dry and relatively mild weather for their drives and flights home, except for freezing temperatures on the northern Plains and gray, slushy weather in parts of the Pacific Northwest.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Retailers got what they wanted over the Thanksgiving weekend - a strong start to the 2006 holiday shopping season as consumers crowded stores in search of huge discounts on flat-screen TVs and other hot merchandise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stores and malls that opened as early as midnight Friday drew a bigger-than-expected turnout, and robust sales for the first day of the season offset slower business as the weekend wore on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest winners appeared to be electronics chains such as Best Buy Co. Inc. and popular-priced department stores including J.C. Penney Co. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which had promised its most aggressive discounting ever, said same-store sales for November will be slightly below its already lackluster forecast.</SPAN></P>
