<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVEN IF THEY VIOLATED NYPD guidelines, the cops under investigation for shooting three unarmed men may not have broken the law, experts said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though a Queens grand jury is expected to consider a range of charges beginning with second-degree murder, the cops are more likely to be found guilty of department infractions - while the city foots the bill for the costly wrongful-death and negligence suits that are sure to come. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The history is that it is extraordinarily hard to criminally prosecute officers who were on duty,&quot; said Eugene O'Donnell, professor of police science at CUNY's John Jay College of Criminal Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops have faced criminal trials, such as those involved in the high-profile deaths of Anthony Baez and Amadou Diallo, with mixed results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In most of these cases, justice comes to the families in the form of [civil] lawsuit damages,&quot; said O'Donnell, a former Bronx cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Mayor Bloomberg called the amount of firepower used &quot;unacceptable or inexplicable,&quot; it might not rise to the level of a crime, Jim Cohen, a professor of criminal law at Fordham Law School, told The Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The number of shots fired doesn't mean anything, even though it seems a little shocking,&quot; Cohen added. &quot;We simply don't have enough information to draw any conclusions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But another John Jay professor, Jeanne Thelwell, said the apparent failure to follow NYPD guidelines could clear the way for a successful civil suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Simply the fact that they did not stop after three shots might be enough for a civil judgment,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after the deadly encounter in Jamaica early Saturday, attorneys were in abundance to represent families and survivors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slain groom </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parents and the family of wounded victim Joseph Guzman retained noted negligence lawyer Sanford Rubenstein and Michael Hardy, both long associated with the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rubenstein previously represented Abner Louima, who was beaten and sodomized by cops in 1997, in a successful civil suit against the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this stage we're not looking at the lawsuit aspect at all,&quot; insisted Manhattan lawyer Kareem Vessup, whose firm was retained Monday night to represent the family of victim Trent Benefield, who is also hospitalized with gunshot wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to O'Donnell, the Police Department could charge the five officers with misconduct, and penalties would range from termination to retraining.</SPAN></P>
