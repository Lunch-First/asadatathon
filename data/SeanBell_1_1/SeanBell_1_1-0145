<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN ANGRY crowd demanded today to know why police officers killed an unarmed man on the day of his wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a vigil and rally the day after 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was supposed to have married the mother of his two young children, a crowd led by the black civil rights leader, the Reverend Al Sharpton, shouted ''No justice, no peace''. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, the crowd of a few hundred counted off to 50, the number of rounds fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We cannot allow this to continue to happen,'' Mr Sharpton said at the gathering outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where one of the wounded men was in a critical condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We've got to understand that all of us were in that car.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some in the crowd called for the ouster of Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, yelling ''Kelly must go''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police officers' group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care said it was issuing a vote of no confidence in Kelly over the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Browne, chief spokesman for the NYPD, said today, ''We are continuing to look for additional witnesses to shed light on the incident, and assisting the district attorney's office with its investigation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five officers had been placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation, Mr Browne said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community leaders planned a rally December 6 at police headquarters. The shootings occurred at about 4am Saturday outside the Kalua Cabaret, a strip club where Mr Bell's bachelor party was held. The survivors were Joseph Guzman, 31, who was shot at least 11 times, and Trent Benefield, 23, who was hit three times. Guzman was in critical condition today and Benefield was stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives of all three men -- many of them stoic, and some crying -- attended today's vigil but none spoke publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kelly said the department was still piecing together what happened, and that it was too early to say whether the shooting was justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The car, driven by Mr Bell, was struck by 21 of the police bullets after the vehicle rammed an undercover officer and hit an unmarked NYPD mini-van.</SPAN></P>
