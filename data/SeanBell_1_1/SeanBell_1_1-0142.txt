FIVE New York police officers have been stripped of their weapons as internal investigators try to work out why they fired 51 bullets at a group of unarmed men, killing a young father-of-two as he left his bachelor party. 
The incident has provoked accusations of racism from the black and Hispanic communities in Queens, as well as calls for the sacking of New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.
The groom, 
 23, was killed less than 36 hours before he was to have been married.
Bell and two of his friends were shot as they left the Kalua Cabaret, a strip club in Jamaica, Queens, that was the subject of an undercover investigation into drugs and prostitution.
At least seven plainclothes police officers were stationed in and around the club just after 4am on Saturday.
Bell and his friends were apparently involved in an argument as they left the club. One of the men allegedly yelled, ''Yo, get my gun'' before the groups separated and Bell and his friends got into their car.
Five officers opened fire on the vehicle after it drove into an unmarked NYPD minivan. The officers' shots struck the men's car 21 times. Bell's friends were both hit, and one, Joseph Guzman, remains in a critical condition.
Commissioner Kelly denied that the officers had targeted the victims because of their race, and said that two of the police officers were black and one was Hispanic.
Nicole Paultre, who was to have been Bell's bride, was among those who attended a protest rally in Queens yesterday that was addressed by black community leader the Rev. Al Sharpton.
''We cannot allow this to continue to happen,'' Mr Sharpton told protesters.
