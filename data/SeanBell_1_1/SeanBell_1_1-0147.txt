FIVE New York police officers have been stripped of their weapons as investigators try to work out why they fired 51 bullets at a group of unarmed men, killing a young father as he left his bachelor party. 
The incident has provoked accusations of racism and calls for the sacking of New York police commissioner Ray Kelly.
The groom, 
 23, was killed less than 36 hours before he was to have been married. Mr Bell and two friends were shot as they left the Kalua Cabaret, a strip club in Queens that was the subject of an undercover investigation into drugs and prostitution.
Mr Bell's fiancee Nicole Paultre was among those who attended a protest rally in Queens yesterday that was addressed by black community leaders.
