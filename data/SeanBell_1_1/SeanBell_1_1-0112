<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIMMERING anger over a deadly police shooting in New York boiled over yesterday as police admitted an undercover officer had been drinking before he opened fire on a car containing three unarmed men. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses contradicted an official version of events in which five police officers fired 50 shots at a car outside a nightclub in the Queens district, killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, the day before he was to get married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of his friends were injured in the bloodbath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facing a third day of community protests, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg convened a summit of black leaders and government officials, during which he criticised the actions of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It sounds to me like excessive force was used,'' he said after the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting has prompted anti-NYPD protests and black community leader, the Rev Al Sharpton, said many African Americans were justifiably frightened of police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev Sharpton said he told Bloomberg: ''Imagine, Mr Mayor, living in a city where you have to worry about the cops and the robbers. Some people have to worry about the robbers, we have to worry about both.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said they opened fire on Bell and his friends after their car rammed a police vehicle and hit an undercover police officer, who was on foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But yesterday, a witness said police began firing without identifying themselves or calling for the car to stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trini Wright, a dancer at the club, told investigators that it was the police who rammed the car the young men were in, not the other way around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Ray Kelly revealed that one of the undercover officers had two beers inside the club but was not given a breathalyser test after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kelly said undercover officers in the field were allowed two drinks and were not normally tested for intoxication but were instead judged fit or unfit for duty by their supervisors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's fiance and the mother of his two children, Nicole Paultre, also spoke publicly about the shooting for the first time yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told a New York radio station: ''First I would start by not referring to them as officers, they are murderers. They are not officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''No one gives anybody the right to kill somebody, to take someone's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They don't know what they've done. What pain they've caused to this family. To my kids.''</SPAN></P>
