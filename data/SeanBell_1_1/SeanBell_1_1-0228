<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor of New York acknowledged yesterday that excessive force was used when police shot a bridegroom outside his stag party in a fusillade of 50 shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As activists planned a big rally against police violence for next week, Michael Bloomberg invited local black leaders to City Hall in an attempt to quell outrage over the killing of the young black man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50 shots fired,&quot; Mr Bloomberg said, promising a full investigation. &quot;The community is outraged and I am, to put it mildly, deeply disturbed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, 23, was killed in his car outside the topless club in the Jamaica section of New York early on Saturday, hours before his planned wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two passengers were wounded when undercover officers who had been staking out the club unleashed the hail of shots on the car in the apparently mistaken belief that one of the men was armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black activists, led by the Rev Al Sharpton, staged protests against what they called police brutality and scheduled a demonstration for December 6. But the shooting did not provoke a repeat of the racial tension that followed the 1999 death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant shot by police in a burst of 41 shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five officers who fired on Mr Bell were stripped of their guns yesterday and placed on administrative duty while the district attorney decides whether to prosecute.</SPAN></P>
