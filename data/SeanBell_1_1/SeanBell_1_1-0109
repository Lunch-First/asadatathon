<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK: Mayor Michael Bloomberg yesterday moved to defuse racial tensions in New York, describing as ''inexplicable'' how police fatally shot an unarmed black man just hours before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, died and two friends were hurt when their car was hit by a hail of bullets in an undercover operation that went wrong outside a Queens nightclub on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It emerged yesterday that an undercover officer fired on the men's car as they tried to run him down after a fight outside the club.</SPAN></P>
