<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK police officers shot dead an unarmed man on the day he was due to get married as he left his stag night at a strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers fired about 50 rounds at a car in which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his friends were travelling after the vehicle crashed into an unmarked police van. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, 23, who was driving, was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital after being shot in the neck arm and shoulder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had been due to marry the mother of his two young daughters hours later. Instead, Nicole Paultre, 22, was driven to a New York hospital to identify the body of her high school sweetheart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other men in the car were also hit, one 11 times. Raymond Kelly, the New York police commissioner, said it was too early to say if the shooting was justified. The district attorney's office is investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident stemmed from an undercover police operation inside the Kalua Cabaret, a strip club in Queens, Mr Kelly said. The club, which had a &quot;chronic history of narcotics, prostitution and weapons complaints'', was one violation away from being shut down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At around 4am, there was an altercation outside the club in which one man was heard shouting: &quot;Yo, get my gun.'' Police followed a group of men as they got into a car and drove off. It was thought they were armed, Mr Kelly said, but no weapons were found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell and his friends apparently did not realise the plain clothes officers were police and fled. The officers opened fire after the men twice rammed an unmarked NYPD van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spray of bullets hit the car 21 times. One officer fired his gun 31 times, emptying two full magazines, Mr Kelly said. He would not say whether the collision was what prompted the officers to open fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A train station and nearby homes were also hit but no residents were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Guzman, 31, who was in the front seat and shot at least 11 times, was critical in hospital. Trent Benefield, 23, was hit three times and described as stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four officers were treated at hospital for minor injuries. </SPAN></P>
