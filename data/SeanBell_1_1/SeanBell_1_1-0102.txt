NEW YORK  --  Investigators think two mysterious men  --  one of whom may have had a gun  --  could hold the key to learning why police unleashed a 50-bullet barrage that killed a groom leaving his bachelor party at a strip club hours before his wedding.  
  One man was last seen dressed in black, standing in front of a sport-utility vehicle with silver rims and exchanging glares and insults with the groom, 
 Another man was last seen wearing a beige jacket and running away from Bell's car as five officers fired. 
  Law enforcement officials provided partial descriptions of the two missing witnesses and details about their possible roles based on accounts from undercover officers and at least one civilian. 
  The shooting has ignited outrage in New York, and civil rights activists Jesse L. Jackson and Al Sharpton visited the scene of the shooting to console the victims' relatives. 
  Union officials have suggested that the fourth man could have fled with a gun  --  a scenario investigators have not ruled out.
