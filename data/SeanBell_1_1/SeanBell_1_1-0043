<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The white detective who squeezed off 31 of 50 shots at three unarmed men outside a Queens strip joint had a clean record, never fired his gun in the line of duty and was known as a good street cop. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His unblemished history left fellow officers puzzled yesterday over what led the 12-year veteran to get down on one knee and empty two clips on the darkened Jamaica street early Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He lost it. Four or five rounds - maybe. But to reload? It's hard to understand. Even in the heat of the moment, it's overkill,&quot; a law enforcement source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, seven plainclothes officers were involved in what should have been a textbook prostitution sting as part of the city's effort to shutter the Kalua Cabaret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the NYPD has interviewed only two cops - the ones who did not fire: an undercover detective who remained outside the club and a lieutenant who ducked behind the dashboard of his unmarked car when bullets flew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questioning the officers who fired falls to the Queens district attorney's office, which sources said plans to present the case to a grand jury this week. Of the five, two are white, two are black and one is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from the 12-year vet, the other officers involved in the shooting are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">n An undercover Hispanic officer with five years on the job who fired first and shot 11 rounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">n A five-year veteran who fired three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">n A 17-year veteran who fired four times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">n A nine-year veteran who fired once.</SPAN></P>
