<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVER since he was a kid, this cop dreamed of joining the NYPD. Now, aburning building looks more inviting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever we do, we're damned,&quot; said the officer, who plans to apply tothe Fire Department.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this critical moment in our city's history, when we need firmleadership and a level head, our clueless mayor has chosen to act like arank amateur. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's handed the reins of this city to the likes of Al Sharpton and JesseJackson, the dilettante civil-rights leader who parachutes in whenever aHollywood star utters a racial slur or a New York City cop shoots his gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the spell of these men, Mayor Bloomberg has already declared thatthe fatal police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - still under investigation and withmany questions unanswered - was no mistake. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's chief executive has all but declared it a crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Excessive,&quot; Bloomberg termed the episode, a word that echoed from 1Police Plaza to your local precinct. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no evidence that they [Bell and friends] were doing anythingwrong,&quot; he also said - implying that all evidence has already beencollected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then, the city's de facto commander-in-chief - the man the policecommissioner and all cops answer to - said his remarks were those of a&quot;civilian.&quot; What? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, an energized Mayor Sharpton is ramping up the rhetoric. He declared,&quot;We will be shopping for justice while people go shopping for theholidays!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These cops don't stand a chance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tragic death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the eve of his wedding, absolutelydeserves a thorough review. Among the questions that should be answered inthe coming days is - why were 50 shots fired at the car he was driving? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports so far suggest the cops had reason to fear for their lives -rightly or wrongly. Maybe they panicked. Or perhaps their fear wasjustified. This is why we have investigations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to call it a crime is premature at best. And reckless at worst. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We go out there every day and we make a difference,&quot; another city copsaid to me. His stress was evident - this man should not have to protest somuch. Deep in their hearts, Sharpton and Bloomberg know it is true. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson in charge, the truth doesn't standa chance. And neither does this city.</SPAN></P>
