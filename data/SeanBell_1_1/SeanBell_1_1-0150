<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of angry protesters shouted &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; in New York on Sunday, demanding to know why police officers had killed an unarmed black man on the day of his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people at the vigil and rally called for the sacking of New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and many counted up to 50 - the number of rounds that are estimated to have been fired by police at three unarmed men in a car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bullets killed 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> early on Saturday, hours before he was supposed to marry the mother of his two young children. His two friends were wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five officers have been placed on paid administrative leave and stripped of their guns, said New York Police Department chief spokesman Paul Browne. Police and prosecutors pledged a full inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, at the rally outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where one of the two wounded men remains in a critical condition, prominent civil rights leader Al Sharpton insisted: &quot;We cannot allow this to continue to happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to understand that all of us were in that car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kelly says that police shot at the car after it drove forward and hit an undercover officer and an unmarked police minivan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The information was based on interviews with witnesses and two officers who did not fire their weapons, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But witness Trini Wright said: &quot;The minivan came around the corner and smashed into their car, adding that the police had &quot;jumped out shooting. No 'stop,' no 'freeze,' no nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kelly said that it was unclear whether the officers, who were in plain clothes, had identified themselves before firing.</SPAN></P>
