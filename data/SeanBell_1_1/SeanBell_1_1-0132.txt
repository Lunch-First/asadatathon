DeMarcus Nelson scored 19 Tuesday night as No. 11 Duke held on to beat Indiana 54-51 in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge, remaining the only unbeaten team in the event's eight-year history.
The Blue Devils (6-1) won their 45th straight nonconference home game despite struggling with their shooting and offensive execution. Duke shot 32 percent, 4-of-18 after halftime, but made the Hoosiers (3-2) fight for just about every basket in a tough game that came down to the final possession.
It was the Blue Devils' fewest points in a win since a 47-46 victory over Georgia Tech on Feb. 3, 1982, Mike Krzyzewski's second season in Durham. Still, Duke did enough to give its Hall of Fame coach his 759th victory, tying Western Kentucky's Ed Diddle for 10th all time. 
"Our offense put so much pressure on our defense that ... we have to play great defense or else we don't win this game," Krzyzewski said.
