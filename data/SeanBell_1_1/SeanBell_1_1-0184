<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING (AP) - Explosions in two Chinese coal mines have left at least 53 workers dead and six missing, China's Xinhua News Agency and safety officials said Sunday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both blasts occurred the same day and together represent the highest reported death toll for one day in China's notoriously dangerous mines in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first occurred Saturday in the Yuanhua Coal Mine in Jixi, a city in northeastern Heilongjiang province, Xinhua said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Sunday, the remains of 21 miners had been found, while six miners were still missing, Xinhua said. Four managed to escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the southwestern province Yunnan, the death toll from a gas explosion in a shaft in Fuyuan county rose overnight from 20 to at least 32 miners as rescuers found more bodies, Xinhua said. Another 28 miners were injured in the blast, it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ceremony never occurred Saturday. Police shot 50 rounds at the groom's car as he drove away from his bachelor party, killing the 23-year-old hours before he was to walk down the aisle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hail of gunfire at a car full of unarmed men drew an outcry from family members and community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers' shots struck the men's car 21 times after it rammed into an undercover officer and hit an unmarked NYPD minivan, police said. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said it was too early to say whether the shooting was justified.</SPAN></P>
