<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK: Mayor Michael Bloomberg has weighed in on the uproar over a police shooting, saying officers appeared to use ''excessive force'' when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man outside a strip club hours before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what happened,'' the New York City mayor said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had just met with elected officials and community leaders including the Reverend Al Sharpton, a black civil rights leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early on Saturday after a bachelor party at the strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspecting that one of the men had a gun, police fired 50 rounds into the vehicle. The men were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her first public comments on the shooting, Mr Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre, told a radio station that the people who shot her husband should not be called officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They were murderers, murderers,'' she told hip-hop station Power 105.1. ''They were not officers. No one gives anyone the right to kill somebody.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sharpton called the conference a ''very candid'' meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the message to Mr Bloomberg was: ''This city must show moral outrage that 50 shots were fired on three unarmed men.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some have questioned if the shooting was racially motivated because the victims were black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five officers who fired their guns included two blacks, two whites and one Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former mayor Rudy Giuliani was hounded for what some viewed as a slow response to the killing of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who was shot 19 times, in the Bronx, by four white officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four were acquitted of criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gunfire in the current case stemmed from an undercover operation inside the strip club.</SPAN></P>
