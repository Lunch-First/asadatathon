<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were high-school sweethearts -  proud parents on the verge of solidifying their relationship in marriage.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the groom is dead at the hands of police, and his mother is devastated.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm numb,&quot; said Valerie Bell, whose son, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was one of three men shot by cops near the Kalua club in Jamaica, Queens. &quot;He was supposed to get married today. I'm numb.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's cousin Robert Porter, who was supposed to be the DJ at the wedding, said Bell was eager to take the next big step in his life.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was going to have a beautiful wedding, live his life with his children, and now this,&quot; Bell said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a good young man, never caused any problems, and now he's dead.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell and fianc&eacute;e Nicole Paultre, 22, began dating eight years ago as students at John Adams HS in Ozone Park, where Bell was a star baseball player.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three years ago, the two had their first daughter, Jada, and five months ago, they had their second girl, Jordyn.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was after the second child that they decided to tie the knot &quot;because it's the right thing to do,&quot; said Paultre's godfather, Ray Hargrove, 53.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've been sweethearts since high school, and they stuck together. And now they were going to make it righteous.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple expected 160 people from around the country to attend their wedding reception at the La Bella Vita restaurant and catering hall, just a few blocks from their high school.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that is where they will hold the funeral reception.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He did not deserve to be killed execution-style on his wedding day,&quot; said Paultre's mother, Laura. &quot;He was a beloved son, father, soon to be husband.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salmon, roast beef and pork loin highlighted the buffet menu, but alcohol was not to be served, except for one champagne toast.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not celebrating,&quot; said Paultre's father, Les. &quot;I'm supposed to be celebrating my daughter's wedding.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">La Bella Vita owner Tony Modica said he saw only    good things in the    young couple.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were really    in love, you could    just tell,&quot; he said. &quot;They were a very nice family.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the restaurant's upstairs reception hall, a white board saying &quot;Sean and Nicole&quot; was still hanging.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flowers never arrived and the cake was never baked.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The families have now shifted their focus toward justice, enlisting the aid of the Rev. Al Sharpton.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, she's preparing for his funeral rather than his wedding,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;We need real answers.&quot; </SPAN></P>
