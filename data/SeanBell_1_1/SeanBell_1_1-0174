<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court hears arguments Wednesday in a case that could determine whether the Bush administration must change course in how it deals with the threat of global warming. A dozen states as well as environmental groups and large cities are trying to convince the court that the Environmental Protection Agency must regulate, as a matter of public health, the amount of carbon dioxide that comes from vehicles. Carbon dioxide is produced when fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas are burned. It is the principal ``greenhouse'' gas that many scientists believe is flowing into the atmosphere at an unprecedented rate, leading to a warming of the earth and widespread ecological changes. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">LEXINGTON, S.C.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c8">Bet leads to slaying</SPAN><BR></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An angry crowd demanded Sunday to know why police officers killed an unarmed man on the day of his wedding, firing dozens of shots that also wounded two of the man's friends.
