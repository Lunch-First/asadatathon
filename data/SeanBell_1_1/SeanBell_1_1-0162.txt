   NEW YORK - Calling the hail of police gunfire that killed an unarmed man and wounded two others "unacceptable," Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached out to angry community leaders.  
 "I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened," Bloomberg said  yesterday at a news conference after meeting with elected officials and community leaders including the Rev. Al Sharpton and Rep. Charles Rangel. 
Bloomberg said bluntly that officers appeared to use "excessive force" when 23-year-old 
 was killed hours before his wedding. 
   Two of the groom's friends were wounded in the shooting Saturday following a bachelor party at a strip club. Suspecting that one of the men had a gun, the officers fired 50 rounds into the men's vehicle. The three were unarmed. 
   As anger simmered in the community over the weekend, Bloomberg - who was reportedly out of town and had been in touch by e-mail and phone - invited local leaders to city hall yesterday for a  meeting with him and police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. 
The Rev.  Sharpton called it a "very candid" meeting. He said the message to Bloomberg was: "This city must show moral outrage that 50 shots were fired on three unarmed men." 
 For a mayor to question the actions of the officers and defend the shooting victims - while reaching out  to the grieving community - sets a decidedly different tone than in the past. Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani was hounded for what some viewed as a slow response to the killing of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who was shot 19 times in the Bronx by four white officers. The shooters were later acquitted of criminal charges.
