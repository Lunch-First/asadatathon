<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York mayor 'disturbed' by killing NEW York's mayor said it appeared 'excessive force' was used when an unarmed black man was gunned down by police in a hail of bullets on the eve of his wedding. Black community leaders called on Michael Bloomberg and police commissioner Ray Kelly to show 'moral outrage' as they met the officials after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> death at the weekend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bloomberg said he was 'deeply disturbed' by the incident, which left two of the 23-year-old's friends injured, adding that it was 'unacceptable or inexplicable' to him how officers could have unleashed 50 shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged prosecutors to carry out their investigation as quickly as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISRAELI Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reached out to the Palestinians yesterday in one of his most conciliatory speeches yet, saying he was prepared to grant them a state, release funds and free prisoners if they choose the path of peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olmert's remarks built on a day-old truce meant to end five months of violence in the Gaza Strip. But new rocket attacks by Palestinian militants threatened the latest truce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I hold out my hand in peace to our Palestinian neighbours in the hope that it won't be returned empty,' Olmert said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We cannot change the past and we will not be able to bring back the victims on both sides of the borders,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'All that we can do today is stop additional tragedies.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAMELA ANDERSON has filed for divorce from husband Kid Rock less than four months after the couple married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star confirmed the news on her website, writing, 'Divorce. Yes, it's true. Unfortunately impossible.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her spokeswoman told People magazine, 'Pamela filed for divorce last week. It wasn't a happy Thanksgiving.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month it emerged Anderson had suffered a miscarriage in the early stages of pregnancy. The magazine said Anderson, 39, and musician Rock, 35, both filed divorce petitions yesterday citing irreconcilable differences. The couple held a string of ceremonies to mark their marriage, described by Anderson as 'the best most romantic wedding of all time'.</SPAN></P>
