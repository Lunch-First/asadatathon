<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLICE commissioner Raymond Kelly appointed a nine-member task force yesterday to review how the New York Police Department selects, trains, uses and supervises its undercover officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee will not investigate the fatal police shooting of 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Jamaica, Queens, last Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it may make recommendations based on any lessons learned that arise from it,&quot; Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Chief Charles Campisi, head of the department's internal affairs bureau, will head the team. Kelly said the group will be expected to make recommendations quickly, but he did not impose a specific deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly has said it was &quot;unusual&quot; that one of the undercover officers involved in the controversial shooting of Bell and his two friends decided to trail the men and confront them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Usually, undercover cops quietly identify suspects and tip off plainclothes officers who make the arrests, allowing the undercover to remain unidentified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell and his friends were shot near the Kalua Cabaret strip club in Queens after a 28-year-old undercover cop approached them as they got into Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover cop believed one of Bell's pals had a gun and fired the first of 50 police bullets after Bell clipped the undercover with his car. Bell and his friends were not armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg has said that it appears that the officers &quot;used excessive force&quot; - an opinion backed by Gov. Pataki and Gov.-elect Eliot Spitzer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly has not publicly judged the actions of the cops, who were placed on paid leave and told to give up their guns pending the outcome of a grand jury probe. None of the cops had never fired their guns in the line of duty before the fatal shooting.</SPAN></P>
