<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK: Mayor Michael Bloomberg has weighed in to the uproar over a New York police shooting, saying officers appeared to use excessive force when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man outside a strip club hours before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I can tell you it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened,'' Mr Bloomberg said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking after meeting New York officials and community leaders, including black civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton and congressman Charles Rangel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early on Saturday when police opened fire after a bachelor party at the strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell's car reportedly struck an undercover police officer and a police car as he pulled away from the club with two friends. Suspecting one of the men had a gun, police opened fire. All three were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her first public comments on the shooting, Mr Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre, told a radio station the people who shot him should not be called officers. ''They were murderers, murderers,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sharpton said the conference of leaders had been ''very candid''. The message to Mr Bloomberg was: ''This city must show moral outrage that 50 shots were fired on three unarmed men.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some have suggested the shooting was racially motivated, as the victims were all black. Of the five officers who fired, two were white, one was hispanic and two were black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bloomberg said there was ''no evidence'' the victims were doing anything wrongbefore their car struck the police officer. For a mayor to question the actions of the police and defend the shooting victims sets a different tone for the city. Former mayor Rudy Giuliani was attacked in 1999 for responding slowly to the killing of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who was shot 19 times by four white officers, who were acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bell shooting stemmed from an undercover case in the Kalua Cabaret club. Seven officers were investigating prostitution and drug use. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the groom was involved in an argument outside the club after 4am, and one of his friends had referred to a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An undercover officer walked behind Mr Bell and his friends as they went to their car. As he walked towards the front of the vehicle, they drove forward, striking him and a police car, Mr Kelly said. The officer was reportedly the first to open fire, he said. One 12-year veteran fired his weapon 31 times.</SPAN></P>
