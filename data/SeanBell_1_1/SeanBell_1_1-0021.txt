AUTHORITIES WARNED cops on both sides of the Hudson River yesterday to be on alert after getting threats from gang members vowing to kill police officers in retaliation for last Saturday's shooting of an unarmed Queens man. 
NYPD officers were told of the two threats during roll calls across the five boroughs as investigators in the city and in Essex County, N.J., were trying to confirm the origin and validity of the threats. Neither threat mentioned specific targets.
A "message was read at roll calls to remind members of the service to exercise caution, remain alert and to wear their protective vests," Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said last night.
The vague threat against city cops, Browne said, was in response to the shooting early Saturday that left 
 dead minutes after leaving a seedy Queens strip club.
Essex County authorities said a separate threat was phoned to prosecutors. The caller claimed an unusual pact had been made between local groups of Bloods and Crips.
