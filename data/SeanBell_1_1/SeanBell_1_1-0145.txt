AN ANGRY crowd demanded today to know why police officers killed an unarmed man on the day of his wedding.
At a vigil and rally the day after 23-year-old 
 was supposed to have married the mother of his two young children, a crowd led by the black civil rights leader, the Reverend Al Sharpton, shouted ''No justice, no peace''. 
At one point, the crowd of a few hundred counted off to 50, the number of rounds fired.
''We cannot allow this to continue to happen,'' Mr Sharpton said at the gathering outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where one of the wounded men was in a critical condition.
''We've got to understand that all of us were in that car.''
Some in the crowd called for the ouster of Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, yelling ''Kelly must go''.
The police officers' group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care said it was issuing a vote of no confidence in Kelly over the shooting.
Paul Browne, chief spokesman for the NYPD, said today, ''We are continuing to look for additional witnesses to shed light on the incident, and assisting the district attorney's office with its investigation.''
The five officers had been placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation, Mr Browne said.
Community leaders planned a rally December 6 at police headquarters. The shootings occurred at about 4am Saturday outside the Kalua Cabaret, a strip club where Mr Bell's bachelor party was held. The survivors were Joseph Guzman, 31, who was shot at least 11 times, and Trent Benefield, 23, who was hit three times. Guzman was in critical condition today and Benefield was stable.
Relatives of all three men -- many of them stoic, and some crying -- attended today's vigil but none spoke publicly.
Mr Kelly said the department was still piecing together what happened, and that it was too early to say whether the shooting was justified.
The car, driven by Mr Bell, was struck by 21 of the police bullets after the vehicle rammed an undercover officer and hit an unmarked NYPD mini-van.
