<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KANDAHAR, Afghanistan -- A suicide bomber detonated himself today near a convoy of foreign troops in southern Afghanistan, killing two Canadian soldiers and an Afghan civilian, police said. The attacker drove his car up to the convoy and then blew himself up, said Kandahar provincial police chief Ismatullah Alizai. Another civilian was wounded, and some 15 camels who were with a group of nomads were killed, he said. On Sunday, a Pakistani suicide bomber detonated himself in a crowded restaurant, killing 15 people and wounding 24, including an Afghan special forces commander and a district chief, who appeared to be the target of his attack, the provincial governor said. Also Sunday, one NATO soldier and an estimated 57 insurgents were killed in four other attacks in southern Afghanistan.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Man killed in dispute over $20 bet</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LEXINGTON, S.C. -- A man fatally shot his friend with a high-powered rifle in a dispute over a $20 bet on the annual South Carolina-Clemson college football game, authorities said Sunday. James Walter Quick, 42, has been charged with murder in the shooting of Richard Allen Johnson, 43, authorities said. The two, who drank beer all afternoon and watched the game Saturday at Johnson's home, began arguing about the bet after the game. Lexington County Sheriff James Metts said Quick got his hunting rifle from his car and fired one shot, hitting Johnson in the chest. Deputies arrested Quick without incident. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Brit slams Putin, calls ties strained</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON -- A British Cabinet minister accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of &quot;attacks on individual liberty and on democracy&quot; and said Sunday that relations with Moscow were strained after a former KGB agent was poisoned to death in London. The comments by Peter Hain, the government's Northern Ireland secretary, were the strongest leveled at Moscow since Alexander Litvinenko died Thursday. &quot;His success in binding what is a disintegrating nation together with an economy that was collapsing into Mafioso style chaos ... must be balanced against the fact there have been huge attacks on individual liberty and on democracy,&quot; Hain said of Putin. British officials have so far avoided blaming Moscow for Litvinenko's death and Hain did not comment directly on the case.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Answers sought in police shooting</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- An angry crowd demanded Sunday to know why police officers killed an unarmed man on the day of his wedding, firing 50 shots that also wounded two of the man's friends. At a vigil and rally the day after 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed, a crowd led by the Rev. Al Sharpton shouted &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot; &quot;We cannot allow this to continue to happen,&quot; Sharpton said at the gathering outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where one of the wounded men was in critical condition. The police officers' group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care said it was issuing a vote of no confidence in Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly over the shooting. The five officers involved in the shooting were placed on paid administrative leave pending investigation.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Oaxaca protestors torch buildings</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAXACA, Mexico -- Leftist protesters trying to force out the Oaxaca state governor set fire to another building Sunday after a night of torching government offices and vehicles in running street battles with police that injured at least 43 people. The violence broke out late Saturday after masked youths broke away from a protest march by about 4,000 people and began attacking police and buildings. Police drove off attackers hurling rocks, fireworks and gasoline bombs in the main square with tear gas and jets of water from tanker trucks and also drove protesters from a camp at a smaller plaza two blocks away. In a press statement, the federal police said 152 people had been arrested. State prosecutors said at least 43 people were injured.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Rebels in Chad press on to capital</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebels who overran the largest city in eastern Chad on Saturday disappeared almost as quickly as they had arrived, as government soldiers re-established control Sunday. But even as government forces retook Abeche, a rebel column headed toward the capital, N'Djamena, the French Embassy said. It was impossible to say if the group had come from Abeche or was another group of rebels. The government of Chad accuses neighboring Sudan of supporting rebels' attempts to overthrow the president, and on Sunday Chad's communications minister accused Saudi Arabia of supporting them also.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Hezbollah plans surprise protests</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Hezbollah's deputy secretary-general said Sunday the militant Shiite Muslim group will press ahead with threatened street protests and other peaceful means seeking to topple Lebanon's Western-backed government and will stage its actions without warning. Sheik Naim Kassem's comments came a day after the Cabinet approved a plan for an international tribunal to try suspects in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, overriding objections from Hezbollah and other factions allied with Syria, which many Lebanese blame for the killing.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Somalia militia nears Ethiopia</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOGADISHU, Somalia -- The Islamic militia that controls much of southern Somalia dispatched thousands of troops Sunday to within nine miles of the border with Ethiopia. &quot;All our troops in the region are now ready at the front lines to face their enemy,&quot; said Mohamed Mohamud Agaweine, the military commander for the Council of Islamic Courts in central Somalia. A local reporter also said the Islamists were recruiting people for a holy war against Ethiopia, a largely Christian nation that supports Somalia's fragile government. On Saturday, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said he expected legislators to back a resolution giving him authority to use military force against Somali extremists if they attack Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
