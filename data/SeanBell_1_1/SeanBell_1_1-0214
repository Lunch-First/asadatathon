<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours before he was to be married, a man leaving his bachelor party at a strip club in Queens that was under police surveillance was shot and killed early yesterday in a hail of police bullets, witnesses and the police said. Two of his friends were wounded, one critically, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many details of the shooting were not immediately clear, but relatives of the dead man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, and community leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, demanded an investigation into what some called an overreaction by officers that killed a man on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses told of chaos, screams and a barrage of gunfire near Club Kalua at 143-08 94th Avenue in Jamaica about 4:15 a.m. after Mr. Bell and his friends walked out and got into their car. Mr. Bell drove the car half a block, turned a corner and struck a black unmarked police minivan bearing several plainclothes officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bell's car then backed up onto a sidewalk, hit a storefront's rolled-down protective gate and nearly struck an undercover officer before shooting forward and slamming into the police van again, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In response, five police officers fired at least 50 rounds at the men's car, a silver Nissan Altima; the bullets ripped into other cars and slammed through an apartment window near the shooting scene on Liverpool Street near 94th Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bell -- who was to have been wed at 5 p.m. yesterday to Nicole Paultre, 22, the mother of his two small daughters -- was shot in the neck, shoulder and right arm and was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two wounded men, Joseph Guzman, 21, and Trent Benefield, 23, were taken to Mary Immaculate Hospital, where Mr. Guzman was listed in critical condition and Mr. Benefield in stable condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said at a news conference last night that the men's car had been hit at least 21 times. He said he did not know what triggered the shooting and that it was too early to tell if it was justified. No guns were found at the scene, and no charges have been filed against the men, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a statement last night that it was too early to draw conclusions about the case. ''We know that the N.Y.P.D. officers on the scene had reason to believe an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and were trying to stop it,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Angry relatives of Mr. Guzman and Mr. Benefield charged that both had been arrested and manacled to their hospital beds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police acknowledged that the men had been handcuffed, but said it had been a precaution at a time when it was unclear whether they were armed. Through the day, the police gave few details about what had happened, calling it a matter under investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly acknowledged last night that much about the episode was unclear, partly because police investigators are precluded for now from questioning the officers involved; a lieutenant and another officer who did not fire any shots were questioned, though. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement, Commissioner Kelly said that about 4 a.m. a group of men confronted a man outside the strip club and that one man in the group yelled, ''Yo, get my gun.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The altercation broke up, and the men separated into two groups, with an undercover officer following one group. The men being followed by the undercover officer got into the Altima that then hit the minivan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police said that one officer who leaped from the minivan, a 12-year police veteran, fired 31 times, and an undercover officer with nine years on the force fired 11 times. The other officers fired three, four and five times. Shell casings from the officers' 16-shot, 9-millimeter semiautomatic weapons littered the street; at least 40 were later recovered. A fourth person may have been in the Altima, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Legal experts said that investigators, at the behest of prosecutors, almost never interrogate officers involved in fatal shootings, even if criminal conduct is suspected, because doing so might grant a form of immunity and jeopardize prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, declined last night to comment on the substance of the case, but promised a ''full, fair and complete investigation.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shootings reverberated with echoes of the 1999 police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed street vendor and Guinean immigrant who was killed in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment by four police officers who were later acquitted of criminal charges in his death. That killing raised questions of racial profiling and excessive force by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One police official denied any racial motivation in yesterday's shooting and said that two of the officers involved were white, one Hispanic and two black. The victims were either black or Hispanic. None of the officers had been involved in previous shootings, Mr. Kelly said. He said several officers were injured, but none seriously. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharpton, a civil rights leader who has often protested police actions in high-profile and racially charged cases, challenged the police to explain what had happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is a shocking case,'' he said at an afternoon news conference outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, his second of the day in the case. He was flanked by relatives and friends of the victims, most of them somber and some sobbing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharpton said Mr. Guzman might have been struck by anywhere from 8 to 17 bullets. ''The doctor told us it was 17 wounds,'' which could have included entry and exit points, he noted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At an earlier news conference at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Mr. Sharpton, standing with Ms. Paultre and other relatives and friends of the shooting victims, said he had been called in by Mr. Bell's family and had protested to the city ''that this stinks.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Paultre and Mr. Bell, who lived at 91 Beach 27th Street in Far Rockaway, Queens, had been sweethearts since high school. Relatives said Mr. Bell had been a baseball star at John Adams High School in Ozone Park, and noted that Ms. Paultre had attended a bridal shower on Long Island on Friday. The relatives identified their daughters as Jordyn, 3, and Jada, 5 months old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A woman who said she was Mr. Benefield's mother but did not give her name, said her son had been treated like a criminal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's got a shattered leg,'' she said. ''And he's handcuffed. Right hand, left leg.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An aunt of Mr. Guzman, who also did not give her name, said her nephew had been shot repeatedly. ''He got shot 17 times by the police,'' she said. ''Unbelievable. My nephew is laying up there fighting for his life, shot 17 times. It's not right.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Marie Gillion, an aunt of Ms. Paultre, said in a telephone interview that the families had been overjoyed at the prospect of the wedding. ''Sean is a good kid,'' she said, choking back sobs. '' The family wanted them to be married. And for this to happen. This is so sad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Robert Porter, who said he was Mr. Bell's cousin and was to have been a disc jockey at the wedding, said that 250 people had been invited to the ceremony and that many were flying in from around the country. ''I can't really express myself,'' Mr. Porter said. ''It's a numb feeling. I still don't want to believe it.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The events that led to the shooting began with a bachelor party at Club Kalua, a cabaret in a largely residential neighborhood. A police official said that a female undercover officer had been posted inside, backed up by plainclothes officers in two vehicles outside, to investigate chronic reports of drugs and prostitution. Similar surveillance operations have been mounted at clubs in Chelsea in Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was unclear what time Mr. Bell and 20 friends arrived at the club. Eric C. Arrington, 43, said he had been there and noted that the party was not rowdy. The men had platters of rice and chicken. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shortly after 3 a.m., Commissioner Kelly said, the undercover officer inside overheard a club dancer complain about a patron who appeared to be armed, and she went out to alert her supervisor and the backup team of possible trouble. About 4 a.m., as Mr. Bell and some of his friends left, a fight erupted outside. It was unclear who was involved, but it ended and those involved split into two groups. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Four men were then observed getting into Mr. Bell's Nissan Altima, which drove a half block east on 94th Avenue and turned south into Liverpool Street. There it plowed into the unmarked police minivan on the driver's side, apparently just missing a head-on collision. Witnesses said the car suddenly went into reverse, backing up onto a sidewalk where the undercover officer was positioned, then pulled forward and rammed the minivan a second time. That's when the police opened fire, Mr. Kelly said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One neighbor said his car was hit by three bullets and a fourth smashed through his front window, piercing a lamp in the living room. ''There was bullets all over the place,'' said Paul Gomes, 31, who awoke to the barrage of gunfire and pulled his wife and children onto the floor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Robert and Vivian Hernandez, residents of Liverpool Street, were watching television when they heard the crashing of bullets and people yelling. When the gunfire finally died down, they went outside and saw a man leaning on a fence and moaning, ''They shot me in the leg.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly said that two Port Authority Police Officers suffered minor facial injuries at a nearby AirTrain facility when one of the bullets shattered a window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Within minutes, a swarm of police cars converged on the scene and a helicopter appeared overhead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The block where the shooting occurred was sealed off by police tape yesterday afternoon. But the cars involved in the collision were still in the middle of the street, with the Altima pressed up against the driver's side of the minivan. Investigators were tagging shell casings where they lay, numbering them. There was one large cluster near the victims' car, and others were littered about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At La Bella Vita, the Ozone Park catering hall where the Bell-Paultre reception was to have taken place, there was still a sign up late in the day, announcing the celebration. About 200 people were to have attended, said the owner, Tony Modica. He said he had taken 50 phone calls from people seeking directions, and had found himself breaking the terrible news, over and over. <BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">CORRECTION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;An article on Sunday about a police shooting in Queens in which a bridegroom driving away from a strip club was killed and two of his friends wounded gave an erroneous age, supplied by the police, for one victim. (The same error appeared in some copies on Monday in a front-page article about ''contagious shooting'' -- gunfire that spreads among officers who believe that they, or their colleagues, are facing a threat.) The victim, Joseph Guzman, who was critically wounded, is 31, not 21. A map with the article on Monday misstated the location of a storefront gate that the bridegroom backed his car into; it is on the east side of Liverpool Street in Jamaica, not at 94-08 Liverpool, which is on the west side. (A corrected version is at nytimes.com/region.) A picture caption in some copies with a related article on Monday misspelled the surname of another victim, who was also wounded. He is Trent Benefield, not Benfield.<BR></SPAN></P>
