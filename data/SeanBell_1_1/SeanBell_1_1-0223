<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israelis, Palestinians agree to Gaza truce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel and the Palestinians agreed yesterday to a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip to end a five-month Israeli military offensive and the firing of rockets by Palestinian militants into the Jewish state. It was to take effect this morning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas phoned Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert last night to tell him he'd arrived at an agreement with all Palestinian factions to stop firing rockets into Israel from the coastal strip, an Olmert spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miri Eisin said Abbas asked that Israel reciprocate by stopping all military operations in Gaza and withdrawing its forces, and Olmert agreed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inquiry approved into Hariri assassination</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanon's U.S.-backed government has approved the creation of an international tribunal to try suspects in the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri, overriding objections by Hezbollah and the country's pro-Syrian president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The approval was expected to deepen the country's political crisis and spark mass street demonstrations threatened by Hezbollah and its allies to topple the government of Prime Minister Fuad Siniora. An ongoing UN investigation into the February 2005 truck bombing that killed Hariri and 22 others has said the killing's complexity suggests the Syrian and Lebanese intelligence services played a role. Damascus has denied any involvement.</SPAN></P>
