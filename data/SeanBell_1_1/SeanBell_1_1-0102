<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*  MIAMI  --  The 2006 Atlantic hurricane season will close uneventfully Thursday with no hurricane having hit the United States this year, a stark contrast to a record-breaking 2005 season that finished with more than 1,500 dead and thousands more homeless. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*  ATLANTA  --  Federal authorities said they arrested six illegal Mexican immigrants who had security badges that gave them access to the tarmac and other restricted areas at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.
