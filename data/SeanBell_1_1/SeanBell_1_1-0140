<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department has begun an internal investigation into its handling of information gathered in the government's domestic spying program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Democrats criticized the review as too narrow to determine whether the program violated federal law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquiry by Glenn A. Fine, the department's inspector general, will focus on the role of Justice prosecutors and agents in carrying out the warrantless surveillance program run by the National Security Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fine's investigation is not expected to address whether the controversial program is an unconstitutional expansion of presidential power, as its critics and a federal judge in Detroit have charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Michael Bloomberg weighed in on the uproar over a deadly police shooting Monday, saying bluntly that officers appeared to use excessive force when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man in a confrontation outside a strip club hours before his wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened,&quot; Bloomberg said at a news conference after meeting with elected officials and community leaders including the Rev. Al Sharpton and Rep. Charles Rangel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early Saturday after a bachelor party at the strip club. Suspecting that one of the men had a gun, police fired 50 rounds into the vehicle. The men were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton called it a &quot;very candid&quot; meeting. He said the message to Bloomberg was: &quot;This city must show moral outrage that 50 shots were fired on three unarmed men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Conservative groups in New Jersey are pushing a proposal that would grant the rights of marriage - but not the title - to gays, siblings and others involved in domestic partnerships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan comes in reaction to a landmark Supreme Court ruling last month that said gay couples in New Jersey should have access to the same rights and benefits as married couples. Whether to call those rights marriages, civil unions or something else was left up to lawmakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the conservatives' plan, rights would be available to gay couples, relatives and other twosomes who are not eligible to marry, said Len Deo, president of the New Jersey Family Policy Council.</SPAN></P>
