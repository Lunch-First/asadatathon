A GROOM was blasted to death by police as he left a strip club on his stag night.
Officers fired 50 rounds at unarmed 

 car, also hitting two of his friends. 
The vehicle was riddled with 21 bullets after it hit an undercover officer and then rammed an unmarked van twice.
Gunfire sprayed nearby homes and a train station. The undercover marksmen claimed that they thought one of the men in the car might have had a gun but police found no weapons.
One witness said: "All you could hear was pop-pop-pop-pop."

 23, was driving the car.
His pal Joseph Guzman, 31, was in the front seat and was shot at least 11 times.
Trent Benefield, 23, who was in the back seat, was hit three times.
Both men were taken to Mary Immaculate Hospital in New York.
Guzman is in a critical condition but Benefield is stable.
A fourth person in the car fled the scene in the early hours of Saturday morning.
Seven NYPD plain clothes officers were investigating the Kalua Cabaret club in Queens, which has a history of drugs and prostitution problems.
Civil rights leader the Rev Al Sharpton said: "How does one justify 50 shots at unarmed men?
"This stinks. Something about the story being told doesn't seem right."
