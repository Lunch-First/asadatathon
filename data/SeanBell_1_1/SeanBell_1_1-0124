<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day after claiming police used &quot;excessive force&quot; in the strip-club car shooting that left an unarmed man dead on his wedding day, Mayor Bloomberg yesterday said he was speaking only as &quot;a civilian&quot; - but then stated he wants the cops tried in Queens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to criticism from the police unions for labeling the actions of five cops who unleashed 50 rounds &quot;unacceptable,&quot; Bloomberg stated, &quot;I said what I believed. I am a civilian. I am not a professional law-enforcement officer.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although not a single indictment has been handed up in the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, the mayor -  who urged New Yorkers not to rush to judgment -  was already talking about where the jury should sit.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember the [Amadou] Diallo case,&quot; Bloomberg told reporters after meeting with community leaders in Queens.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The trial actually got moved upstate because there was so much going on here. I think it would be better to have it, if there is [a trial], I'd certainly rather have it here. So I want to make sure that we do not prejudice the case.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg was referring to the trial of the Bronx cops who in 1999 fired 41 shots in gunning down Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, when they mistook his wallet for a gun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judge, citing pretrial publicity, changed the venue from The Bronx to Albany, where a jury acquitted the officers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was killed Saturday and his two friends wounded when cops, thinking one of them had a gun, squeezed off dozens of rounds at their moving car. The unarmed trio had just left Bell's bachelor party at a Jamaica strip club.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Bloomberg has gotten high marks from some black leaders for keeping the lid on a volatile situation, Detective Endowment Association chief Michael Palladino said &quot;premature statements made without the benefit of facts only serve to inflame tensions.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts said the mayor's good intentions could backfire by poisoning the jury well.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing that baffles me is he talks about restraint, then makes statements condemning the cops, which is inconsistent and improper,&quot; said lawyer Joseph Tacopina, who represented one of the cops charged in the infamous 1997 Abner Louima torture scandal.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But another lawyer said Bloomberg doesn't risk anything by speaking out about the shooting because bids to change venue are very common -  but they rarely succeed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if the mayor did not say anything, the defense attorneys were going to argue for change of venue,&quot; said Kenneth Thompson, a former federal prosecutor who argued the case against cops convicted of assaulting Louima. &quot;That's the oldest trick in the book.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By meeting with community leaders and criticizing the cops, Bloomberg has avoided the criticism that dogged then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani during the Louima and Diallo cases.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one former Giuliani administration official, who declined to be identified, said Bloomberg &quot;gets a pass&quot; on a lot of issues -  including his decision to offer his high-level opinion during a sensitive investigation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani, the official said, was excoriated for making prejudgments in defense of cops.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rudy would go in one extreme, and Mike [will] go to another extreme, but it's pre-judging,&quot; said the source.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Ray Kelly distanced himself from Bloomberg's &quot;excessive force&quot; comment, saying, &quot;We don't know all the facts.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg yesterday met with Bell's fianc&eacute;e, his parents and the Rev. Al Sharpton for about an hour at the family's church.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterward, Bell's family went on to the J. Foster Phillips funeral home to plan his rites, which are set for Friday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They just killed my son for what reason? I don't think they even know,&quot; Bell's father, William, told ABC-TV Channel 7.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 100 people later attended a rally at the NAACP's headquarters in St. Albans, Queens.  </SPAN></P>
