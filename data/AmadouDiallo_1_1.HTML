Thanks to my mother, Lillian Reagan, who has inspired me with her strength, courage, determination, and love.

At the reception, I spoke about the impact of recent changes in affirmative action on my work providing legal services to poor people in the East Bay. ...  While client autonomy is cherished in American law, poor people and people of color must battle to hold on to their autonomy in the face of scarce resources and the &quot;we know it all&quot; mentality that law school and experience foster. ...  The lack of affirmative action, in the wake of Proposition 209 and its progeny, will further institutionalize this racial isolation and inequality as even fewer people of color will have access to the skills, knowledge, resources, and contacts that enable us to strengthen our communities. ...  Benefits are being curtailed, restrictions are being imposed, and now, the opportunity that most poor people and people of color had to improve their circumstances--affirmative action--has been taken away. ...  The report found the following repercussions: widespread confusion about the meaning and scope of Proposition 209, and a fear of lawsuits; increased resistance to outreach and other affirmative action requirements; increased difficulty in enforcing federal affirmative action requirements; and fewer certifications of minority- and women-owned businesses. ...  Proposition 209 will further limit the number of people of color in the public interest community and restrict the synergy and creativity that emerges when diverse people work together. ... &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8"> TEXT:<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I was asked to write this commentary following my presentation at Boalt Hall School of Law's Women's Reception in March 1999. At the reception, I spoke about the impact of recent changes in affirmative action on my work providing legal services to poor people in the East Bay.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During my presentation, I discussed the impact of affirmative action on the law school's student body and how it would directly impact the clients that we serve. As I looked out into the audience I noticed that there was not one African-American woman present. This was very telling to me. I began to remember the 400 Boalt Hall law students who have interned at the East Bay Community Law Center (EBCLC).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This new audience make-up was a reflection of how many fewer students of color would be available to help our clients. In addition, I realized how so many law students would miss out on the kind of first rate education that Boalt Hall offers. After the reception, I continued to reflect on the new admission policies and truly recognized the reality of the impact that affirmative action has had on my life and the lives of our clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Back in my office, I thought about the full implications of Proposition 209 and how so many communities of which I am a part have been impacted by affirmative action: my family and friends; my neighborhood and city; the community-based organizations with which I work; the professional organizations to which I pay my dues; the University of California at Berkeley, which produces most of the interns and volunteers staffing EBCLC's many projects; and the world of clinical law teachers. I also reflected on the impact affirmative action has had on my own life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growing up in South Central Los Angeles as the daughter of an African-American single mother of five, I was a smart child with a lot of potential. Yet my future opportunities may very well have been limited. My mother struggled to make enough money to send me to a private school so that I would have a chance to go to college. In the pre-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Bakke</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> era of my high school days, I applied to UCLA and was accepted after full consideration was given to all of my attributes--not solely my SAT score and grade point average. After completing my undergraduate studies to UCLA, I applied and was accepted at UCLA School of Law, again, with full consideration of the many talents that I have to offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those of us who were fortunate enough to benefit from affirmative action understand our privilege. As students, we fought hard to maintain affirmative action policies which addressed race and gender discrimination. We knew we would not be able to take advantage of the excellent educational opportunities of the University of California higher education system without affirmative action. We affirmative action babies are often the only professionals in our families and in our communities. We continue the struggle to increase the opportunities available to others that have been traditionally oppressed in this society. Our communities understand the opportunities we have gained; thus, they have set high expectations for us. Throughout the nation, our communities have benefited from the return of dedicated, culturally and professionally competent doctors, lawyers, engineers and teachers to their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affirmative action has allowed us to acquire the skills, knowledge, and experience to help others, to meet people from all walks of life and to make alliances that support the work that we do. In short, it has allowed a generation of minority and women lawyers to have hope--to feel that we have the opportunity to learn, to break down barriers that have been reinforced and institutionalized over time, and to create social justice. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Proposition 209, SP-1 and SP-2, if not overturned, will change all of this forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cutbacks in affirmative action in education are particularly damaging because education affects every aspect of our lives. It is the keystone of democracy. In this highly technologized, global economy, educational and training opportunities are a necessity, not an option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cutbacks in affirmative action have had a devastating effect on the Boalt Hall community, in particular. In just two short years, the University of California law school has become a resegregated institution. While everyone assumed there would be an impact on admissions as a result of SP-1, no one was prepared for the enrollment of only one African American in Boalt Hall's class of 2000. In 1997-1998, the first year of implementation of Proposition 209, Boalt Hall suffered a forty-six percent decrease in minority enrollment.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In last year's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Berkeley Women's Law Journal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, six authors wrote about the personal impact of the decline in enrollment of students of color at Boalt Hall.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The student authors spoke of broken promises, shock, disappointment, anger, and sadness as they confronted what it meant to be part of a resegregated environment. They spoke of tension-filled classes when students and professors dared to discuss race or gender. They eloquently explained how everyone in society benefits from affirmative action because it brings us closer to a just world. They renewed their commitment to fighting for social change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one Commentary piece, Professor Marjorie Shultz provided dramatic examples of how diversity enriches the learning experience.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She referred to the decline in minority enrollment as the loss of a &quot;vital source of excellence.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She spoke of how not having all relevant points of view as part of the issue exploration process prevents students, lawyers, and educators from understanding the different issues, norms, injuries, and remedies that shape our law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I agree that a diversity of perspectives adds to an incredibly rich learning experience both in the classroom and in clinical education. Perhaps for the only time in their lives, students examine how their beliefs, values, and morals influence their work as advocates. Learning how to critically reflect on the assumptions and judgments we make as students prepares us to more consciously and effectively undertake this task throughout our professional careers. Hearing perspectives from students representing the full spectrum of experiences enhances reflection and the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entire learning experience. All students will lose out as the voice of minorities becomes even more faint in our discussions regarding the impact of the legal system on us as advocates and on the communities that we serve. Our ability to prepare students to serve an increasingly diverse population is irreparably harmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I fear that our clinical program will experience the loss of excellence to which Professor Shultz refers. At EBCLC, interns learn how to practice public interest law by experiencing real life ethical and professional dilemmas. Our interns develop the skills necessary to address the many complicated issues affecting our clients' lives, including poverty, domestic violence, mental disability, HIV infection, and drug and alcohol problems. These interactions provide a full and rich legal advocacy experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students enrolled in the clinical must also enroll in the companion course &quot;Community Law Practice at EBCLC&quot; (CLP). The CLP class, which satisfies Boalt Hall's Professional Responsibility requirement, provides an opportunity for students to reflect in writing upon their clinic experiences and class assignments, which include readings and film showings. In both writing their reflection pieces and discussing them with the group, students grapple with difficult and sensitive issues regarding the role of public interest advocates in this society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a class on &quot;Difference,&quot; students are challenged to examine themselves and the ways in which difference impacts their clients and the students' practice of law. Questions of race, class, and privilege are explored in connection with the judgments and assumptions we make about our clients and the impact those assumptions have on our ability to provide competent advocacy. We also examine the role that &quot;difference&quot; plays in our clients' lives in the context of the legal system. While color is generally the most obvious difference between the students and their clients, it is the one that students have the most difficult time addressing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the most recent &quot;Difference&quot; class, an African-American student raised the issue he faces when administrative law judges presume that Blacks are lazy and dishonest when they (Black people) assert their inability to work. Not one person responded to this observation. The conversation quickly turned to a separate discussion about the difficulty students face with the issues regarding economic disadvantage and, to a lesser extent, health. Some students talked about how difficult it is to screen for a client's eligibility for the clinic's services, or to ascertain how someone became infected with HIV. Further discussion concerned mental disability and the basis of our &quot;discomfort&quot; surrounding this issue. However, the topic of race, alone or in the context of other issues, was not addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his reflection piece, the student who initially raised the issue of the perception of the lazy Black stereotype analogized what had happened in class to the debate surrounding affirmative action. Citing Charles &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lawrence, he made the point that &quot;when an individual experiences conflict between racist ideas and the societal ethic that condemns those ideas, the mind excludes his racism from consciousness.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The student's point became even more moving when I read the reflection pieces of the other students. Many of the reflection pieces were silent on the subject of race as a &quot;difference,&quot; or minimized its impact on our clients or on the advocacy relationship. Yet, the students did identify less threatening &quot;difference&quot; issues, and did a fine job analyzing how those issues impacted their client relationships. Even these students who had chosen to serve poor people--if only for a semester--found it difficult to grapple with real questions of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues of race profiling, police abuse, and discrimination are issues that large numbers of white Americans never have to think about. White people do not have to think about racism, whereas people of color experience frequent acts of brutality, injustice, and unfairness on a daily basis because of their race. But differences in perception and experience are exactly the reasons why we must discuss race in &quot;mixed company.&quot; If we are ever to move forward to true social equality, we must be able to honestly explore the power systems which govern our world and gain a greater understanding about how each person's experiences may limit opportunities or allow privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another reflection piece, a student described her propensity to assign responsibility to people with whom she identifies, while she found it easier to blame structural forces for the behavior of people who appear different from her. She talked about how it is easier to recognize another's innocence. I realized how very different her world is from mine. Having experienced racism and sexism so frequently in my life, it is difficult to ascribe a non-racist or non-sexist motive to personal acts of injustice that I experience. Students of color and other subordinated groups in our class have also described the ways in which internalized oppression affects their relationships with their clients. The reflection pieces reveal a plethora of issues faced--including shame, anger, and prejudgment resulting from our different past experiences. These pieces continue to impress upon me how very important these realities are and why they need to be explored in the context of our roles as advocates.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Difference, particularly concerning how we perceive our clients and how they perceive us, certainly has an impact on the advocate-client relationship. The opportunity to explore these issues and to learn how to view each and every client as an individual, worthy of respect and of access to justice, should &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be available to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">every</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> person who seeks to prepare for the practice of law, not just the privileged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have learned from the students' reflection pieces. I learned not only that Lawrence's thesis had proven right once again, but that I too played a role in supporting unconscious racism. I recognized how easily I had let the conversation shift to a safe place. While the discussion about difference was fruitful and comfortable, it may have prevented students from examining a critical reality that our clients, who are predominantly African-American, face in trying to secure disability benefits, safe and affordable housing, and access to health care, employment and education. I am acutely sensitive to these dynamics and continue to explore ways of teaching so that students can even more effectively get to the &quot;hard&quot; issues. Without the participation of diverse students and their forthright reflection and discussion, important issues will go unnoticed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also important for all students to understand how differences between themselves as advocates, and the clients they serve, impact the justice system. The American Bar Association and National Bar Association recently conducted a poll on the different perceptions of justice between Blacks and Whites in America.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the study, two-thirds of the black lawyers said they had witnessed racial bias in the justice system in the past three years.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than eighty percent of the white law-years said they had not.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearly all the black lawyers--about ninety-two percent--said that the justice system has the same amount of racial bias or more as other segments of society.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearly half the white lawyers believed there is less racial bias in the justice system.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These differences--particularly concerning how much justice a client can receive in the legal system--have an impact on the advocate-client relationship as well as the development of the legal system. The exploration of these issues is much more meaningful and likely to lead to needed change when people with diverse perspectives and experiences participate in the discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the classroom benefits, having students of color working at the clinic is very important to our clients. Our overall client population is fifty-seven percent female and forty-three percent male.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fifty four percent of our clients are African Americans, and at least thirty percent of our clients speak a language other than English as their primary language.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having students of color and those reflective of the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  community serving as advocates can help reduce some of the inevitable barriers inherent in the advocate-client relationship. There is already an incredible power dynamic between clients and their advocates. While client autonomy is cherished in American law, poor people and people of color must battle to hold on to their autonomy in the face of scarce resources and the &quot;we know it all&quot; mentality that law school and experience foster. There is an uphill battle for clients to be heard, particularly when they have had very little experience with being heard in the past. Having an advocate who is likely to have shared similar experiences, or who can communicate in the same language as the client, often increases the client's sense of trust and faith. As a woman of color, I know that feeling of warmth and openness which I experience in my interactions with other women of color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also important that our clients see us--women, people of color and other subordinated groups--as capable, intelligent beings. Our clients and their children share a sense of pride and comfort when they see us in roles as lawyers, law students and people in charge. It gives them hope and optimism that is rare in this day and age. It challenges stereotypes to which we have all become accustomed. For example, Elise Brown, an African-American attorney and Director of EBCLC's Housing and Economic Development Units, talks about how she, as a woman of color, is often thought to be the client rather than the attorney. She relays how, at a tenant workshop, a woman walked in to find Elise talking with an older white man. The woman immediately approached the man with questions, assuming that he was an attorney. The woman registered embarrassment when she was told that Elise was, in fact, the attorney. The man was amused and smiled with a sense of recognition and acknowledgment of the woman's perception. Incidents like this point out the importance of increasing opportunities for women and people of color. We will have made progress when no one is surprised that I am the one in charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affirmative action had represented the hope for this progress by breaking down some of the barriers of institutionalized racism. We continue to witness daily, however, the brutal remnants of racism and ignorance throughout the nation. The killing of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an unarmed African immigrant at shot forty-one times by police in New York City;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the dragging/torture death of James Byrd in Jaspar, Texas;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the countless beatings and murders of people because of their national origin or sexual orientation are proof that intolerance and discrimination continue to exist. With modern technology, we are able to document discrimination, even when the perpetrators try deftly to conceal it. In the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Community Law Practice, we view the ABC Prime Time Live production of &quot;True Colors.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While many students--particularly the students of color--know that discrimination exists, a large number better understand the pervasiveness of racism after seeing this film. In it, undercover cameras capture an African-American man being discriminated against in every arena of his life--employment, housing, transportation, even a taxi ride--because of the color of his skin. The lack of affirmative action, in the wake of Proposition 209 and its progeny, will further institutionalize this racial isolation and inequality as even fewer people of color will have access to the skills, knowledge, resources, and contacts that enable us to strengthen our communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inequality of access to resources for people of color can be seen at EBCLC. Instead of seeing opportunities increase for our clients, the clock is being turned back. Benefits are being curtailed, restrictions are being imposed, and now, the opportunity that most poor people and people of color had to improve their circumstances--affirmative action--has been taken away. The demolition of affirmative action is not just the loss of a remedy. It is a signal to my community that we can no longer take for granted a commitment in this society to equality and justice. Without educational and employment opportunities, poor and minority communities will only fall further behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full impact of the assault on affirmative action will take some time to discern. Some of the impact that the implementation of Proposition 209 and related court decisions have already had are discussed in the &quot;Opportunities Lost&quot; report.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report found the following repercussions: widespread confusion about the meaning and scope of Proposition 209, and a fear of lawsuits; increased resistance to outreach and other affirmative action requirements; increased difficulty in enforcing federal affirmative action requirements; and fewer certifications of minority- and women-owned businesses.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, many of the effects of Proposition 209 and its progeny will never be known. In March 1998, then-Governor Pete Wilson ordered state agencies to stop collecting data on the number of contracts awarded to minority- and women-owned businesses.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Executive Order prevented state agencies from evaluating the impact of Proposition 209 and the prevalence of discrimination against minorities and women. It goes well beyond anything required by Proposition 209 and shows the lengths to which Pete Wilson was willing to go to continue centuries of discrimination and exclusion. Hopefully, the Order will be invalidated through the courts, or Governor Davis will reinstate the data collection requirement &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by executive order. We must be able to document what this society does to limit the opportunities available to some of its members, and to take appropriate action--affirmative and otherwise--to remedy the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sad truth is that even before Proposition 209, SP-1 and SP-2, we were already far from parity in education, employment, and public contracting. While efforts have been taken to increase minority enrollment since the passage of Proposition 209, there were still only eight African-American students enrolled in Boalt Hall's class of 2001, less than two-fifths the number of African Americans enrolled in the Class of 1999.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is only one African-American tenured professor at Boalt Hall. We know that, over the long term, Proposition 209 will result in fewer college graduates and professionals of color; fewer contracting opportunities for minority owned businesses; fewer role models and mentors for women and people of color; fewer &quot;qualified&quot; candidates for faculty appointments in public universities; and fewer job opportunities and training programs which lead to living wage employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loss of affirmative action will have other, less visible, impacts as well. The impact of Proposition 209 on community based, non-profit and public interest organizations is seldom discussed. Last weekend, as I stood up to address the audience at the Trina Grillo Retreat,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I once again faced the prospect of talking to a crowd almost completely devoid of people like me. There were a few other people of color, but out of perhaps a hundred participants, the only other African Americans in the room were a staff person from the National Association for Public Interest Law and a guest of one of the other speakers. I wondered why there was such a low turnout of African Americans. Here was a wonderful opportunity for people who share a commitment to social justice to come together in the beautiful surroundings of the Marin Headlands to discuss issues that directly affect our community. Where were the Black people?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth is that there are few people of color in public interest law practice. Low-paying jobs, political restrictions, and constant exposure to many of the problems we went to law school to escape are but a few of the reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public interest community, in many respects, reflects society at large. While many in the Black community are engaged in grassroots civil rights work and political struggles, the racial isolation and segregation that exist in the general society often prevent us from forming important cross-cultural alliances that are so necessary for social justice. As we struggle for social justice, we in the public interest community must address the very same problems within our community (racism, sexism, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  elitism, and classism) that we address on behalf of our clients. The same is true of law schools, including clinical education programs. Proposition 209 will further limit the number of people of color in the public interest community and restrict the synergy and creativity that emerges when diverse people work together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the challenges presented by Proposition 209, EBCLC's clients and advocates continue to move forward. Our clients have faced monumental barriers before. Many of our clients are just beginning to plan for their futures. Many have never worked before or have minimal skills. With few exceptions, those who are able to work are eager to take advantage of job training and development opportunities. Advocating for increased opportunities for our clients, particularly for education and job training that will lead to future careers and living wage jobs, continues to be of paramount importance in our work. This advocacy is undertaken by community members who continue to address critical issues such as access to health care, safe and affordable housing, and economic security. Activists in the East Bay are coming together to make concrete and positive changes. Many of these efforts are led by people who have been fortunate to get an education and obtain job opportunities that allow them to give back to their communities. The implementation of Proposition 209 not only erodes the significant progress that women and minorities have made over the past few decades, but also ensures that large numbers of talented people in our communities may be forever doomed to poverty and hope-lessness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I seek to inspire hope and optimism, I am reminded of the daily indignities and injustices heaped upon me and people like me. I am truly afraid for my son and for my community. The same societal factors that will likely cause him to be stopped by police for &quot;driving while Black&quot; when he is old enough to drive necessitate affirmative action. While I struggle to give my son every possible opportunity in life, I witness the evisceration of affirmative action strategies specifically designed to ameliorate the systemic and institutionalized racism and sexism so deeply rooted in this society. Over the last twenty years, I have visited elementary, junior high, high schools, and universities to reach out to young people. Prior to the passage of Proposition 209, I encouraged them to pursue careers in the law. Now I still encourage them to pursue their dreams. But, in reality, I see doors closing every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Proposition 209, SP-1 and SP-2 will be repealed. Perhaps Governor Davis' proposal to ensure a place in the University of California system for the top four percent of every high school graduating class will increase minority enrollment.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps more of those who have enjoyed &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the benefits of class and wealth in this society will someday recognize the benefit to all when everyone is judged on the quality of their character rather than the privileges from which they have benefited. Until we confront, admit, and resolve the very difficult and complex issues related to race, class and gender discrimination in this country, inequality and injustice will persist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a woman of color and a social justice advocate, I will continue to work to protect and to expand opportunities for my community. I will join with people like Eva Paterson  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and organizations like Equal Rights Advocates  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Chinese for Affirmative Action  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to fight for equality and justice. I will take every opportunity to learn about and teach the impact of racism and its effect on my community and my clients. While the struggle often seems never-ending, we do witness victories from time to time. We must hold onto those victories for times like these.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8"> TEXT:<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this inaugural address, Professor Taylor begins with his beliefs regarding Christianity, and more specifically, Jesus Christ crucified, executed by first century Roman powers. He then continues with an examination of the American prison structure and its statistical and social impact upon American culture. Professor Taylor concludes his address by drawing a connection between Christianity and its role in countering the &quot;terror&quot; established by modern American penal paradigms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The God of Christians is the executed God. Biblical faith and much Christian theology has noted that the God of Jesus Christ - though risen and living, powerful, grace-full, liberating and reconciling, salvific - is the One who was also crucified. That God, in the language of the still-potent book by Jurgen Moltmann, is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The Crucified God</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus to speak of God as crucified is to focus on the passion and death of the concrete Jesus of Nazareth. A God entangled in crucifixion is an antidote to pieties and theologies that would seek their God above the earth and its suffering peoples. It is, instead, to know God in the humanity that has been abandoned, rejected, struggling, and despised. All this is a familiar emphasis of theologies of the cross, or speech regarding a crucified God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To speak of God as executed does something more. Over centuries of Christian discourse, crucified has tended to signify only Jesus' general experience of suffering and death.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The phrase, the executed God, reminds us that God bound up with the life of Jesus of Nazareth, was exposed to material conditions so malignant that he was executed. He did not die accidentally, as a culmination of disease, nor because it was the necessary end of all humans. Nor was it because Jesus possessed, in E. P. Sanders' language, some will to die in order to make a redemptive death.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No - he was put to death. Along the way he was tortured and humiliated. He was done in by executioners.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comedian Dick Gregory once said, with an enlightening twinkle in his eye, that if Christians understood the meaning of Jesus' cross, they would wear around their necks, and hang from their earlobes, little electric chairs. I think he is right. The fact that his suggestion seems morbid, and that many of us persist in hanging a silver or gilded cross from our bodies, suggests we have lost touch with the ugly dimension of execution. In Jesus of Nazareth, God embraced not just death, but execution, i.e. state-sanctioned execution. God, we might say, entered into Rome's and Palestine's state-sanctioned theatrics of terror, and from within that theater of violence, made life wherever crucified peoples still clamor for life.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is there an organized theater of violence today? Do crucified peoples exist now who still need life? I answer yes. To make my case, permit me three moves in this lecture today: first, to portray lockdown America and the theatrics of terror constituting it; second, to offer an account of why America is using a theatrics of terror today through prisons, death penalties, and paramilitary policing; and then, third, to show how Christians embodying a liberating practice informed by the executed God might give rise to a theatrics of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">counter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-terror.

Twelve year-old Jeremiah, interviewed by Jonathan Kozol,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contrasted his own poor community (Bronx, New York) with the more northern and wealthier one of Riverdale. &quot;Life in Riverdale is opened up,&quot; he said. &quot;Where we live, it's locked down.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When asked by Kozol to elaborate, Jeremiah and other youth point to city parks you cannot play in; schools without learning where the police teach you how to walk the halls; libraries you see into but cannot go into because they are locked and barricaded; shopping malls you cannot get into because you cannot get past security vigilance; Bloomingdale stores at Christmas-time that chase you away because you look black, Latino, or poor.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is the homeless street poet that Kozol encounters in a Bronx city park, who, amid his life of struggle, dares language to interpret the whole metropolis: &quot;I see New York as a symbolic city. . . . These buildings are our concrete prisons piled up like Babel. A Satanic technology surrounds us. What we see is apparatus, not humanity.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether from the mouths of youth or homeless elders, today's prison-speak is not just the result of metaphorical dexterity or poetic license. It is rooted in the material, economic, political, and social conditions of our times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bronx children interviewed by Kozol,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for example, live across from Rikers Island  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the East River, the largest penal institution in the world. Ninety-two percent of its caged people are black or Hispanic.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People in the Bronx community and elsewhere have family members cycling in and out, know friends who have been, are, or will be there, as either inmates or employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York City spends $ 58,000 annually on each caged adult, $ 70,000 for each juvenile.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is ten times what the City spends on each child in its public schools.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In trying to justify these expenditures, an educational administrator at Rikers says bluntly:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Without [Rikers] island, the attractive lives some of us lead in the nice sections of New York would simply not be possible. If you want to get your outcasts out of sight, first you need a ghetto and then you need a prison to take pressure off the ghetto. . . . Short-term terror and revulsion are more powerful than long-term wisdom or self-interest.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>This is not just the isolated statement of some twisted staff person, caught speaking out of place. It is, in fact, a window out onto the dynamics that are driving our nation's use of prisons, and the ready use of the death penalty that is applied in the prison house. Quite frankly, the administrator is saying, short-term terror and revulsion are now necessary as a mode of control, an essential mode of governance. We thus have a Gulag  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">A. GULAG AMERICA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States of America has become, in Christian Parenti's words, &quot;A Big House Nation.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prisons are growing in number, and are big business. Over 1.8 million U.S. citizens are in prison.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The figure may be 7.5 million by early next century. Another three million are doing time today in an outer prison of regimented society, under care of the court system, exposed to unannounced visits from parole and probation officers, mandatory urine tests, home detention, or the invisible tether of electronic bracelets.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just since 1980, the prison population has tripled, constituting the largest and most frenetic correctional buildup of any country in the history of the world.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millions more are connected to the incarceration system from the outside.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many outsiders make their living directly or indirectly off the economic stimuli provided to communities by the lockup craze. Administrators at Rikers Island tout themselves as a huge employment opportunity for the South Bronx. While caging their inmates, Rikers employs 10,000 people, 8000 as guards.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small towns in economic slump regularly seek recovery by organizing to host a big prison. Crescent City, California, for example, organized to get the $ 277.5 million Pelican Bay State Prison,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a super-mean maximum security institution. They also got population growth, new garbage contracts, a battery of counseling offices and services (including prison chaplains, of course), an Ace Hardware store, a new area hospital, a 90,000-square-foot K-Mart, and jobs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parenti reports that yearly expenses from the correction industry are between $ 20 and $ 35 billion annually, with more than 523,000 full-time employees working in American corrections - more than in any Fortune 500 company except General Motors.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More that $ 7 billion annually has been spent on prison building in the 1990s.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1996 alone, twenty-six Federal and ninety-six State prisons were begun.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Criminal Justice Report found that nearly 5% of rural population growth between 1980 and 1990 was due to transfer of prisoners to the country, captured in the cities and exiled to the new carceral arcadia.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convention center hotels also play host to Prison Expo conventions. The American Correctional Association  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> held one of these in Nashville, more than 600 booths touting the very latest in prison innovation and technology to more than 5000 conventioneers.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">New York Times</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> article on the convention  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> discusses the buying-spree culture among those who have to keep up with lockdown America's frenetic pace of incarceration. For the warden who has run out of room, says the article, there are temporary cells at $ 40,000 a piece.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For hard-to-handle inmates, there is the latest in restraining chairs, ballistic batons, and plastic handcuffs. And for those who simply prefer to delegate, there are companies that do it all, from designing cellblocks to determining staffing, from setting up a dispensary to beefing up security.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phenomenal growth of the prison industry is often seen as justified, since it is reducing violent crime.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Tom Wicker has documented, however, the decline of crime is not even roughly equivalent to the massive prison build-up.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, the build-up is due more to locking up minor offenders, while the crime decline is usually talked about as putting violent offenders away.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No, to understand the build-up, we have to see its character as inspiring terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">B. The Theatrics of Terror: Its Six Dimensions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the administrator at Rikers Island put it, short-term terror and revulsion are necessary.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gulag, and the punitive measures relating to it, make up a house of horrors, a structure for the practice of a political theatrics of terror. Let me explain this in terms of six dimensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dimension I: Time</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, first of all, the way prisons transform the human experience of time. The prison should be seen as a kind of theater in which time is turned into a weapon of terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most theatrical performances, in the interaction between the play, players and audience, there is a transformation of time - perhaps, a suspension of ordinary time, a creation of a new time that enables a particular insight, often another kind of experience.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the prison theater, time is transformed in a particularly new and destructive way. There is not simply a loss of time. Nor is this just some more intense form of being sent to your room, for time out. It </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">is</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that, and so, time is lost, with mothers and fathers, aunts and uncles missing out seeing children grow into adulthood. Mumia Abu-Jamal,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a resident on Pennsylvania's death row for seventeen years, observes about prison time, that, &quot;Once loving relationships wither into yesterday's dust. Relatives die, their loss mourned in silent loneliness. Times, temperaments, mores change, and the caged move to outdated rhythms.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, beyond this lost time and lost experience, there is a more crucial transformation, i.e., the routinization of time, a transformation intentionally cultivated by prison authorities to make every day like another. Amid routinization, the very perception of time is deadened. As Abu-Jamal says in an essay called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Killing Time</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, intentionally constructed regimens yield a hypnotic sameness.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Time in prison, then, becomes a thick, dull mallet that pounds consciousness into a coma.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a mallet, time thus yields a kind of spirit-death. The mind-numbing, soul-killing savage sameness that makes each day an echo of the day before, with neither thought nor hope of growth, makes prison the abode of spirit-death that it is for over a million men and women now held in U.S. hell-holes.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time as the devourer of flesh and life is born witness to by countless others. There is the poem by Ojibwa Sioux,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> political prisoner, Leonard Peltier, imprisoned for twenty-three years in Federal Prisons for killing two FBI agents, whose killer the prosecutor actually has admitted remains unknown.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twenty-three years have given him this viewpoint on time in prison:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doing time creates a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">demented darkness of my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">own imagination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doing time does this thing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, or course, you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't do time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You do without it. Or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rather, time does you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time is a cannibal that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">devours the flesh of your</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">day by day, bite by bite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dimension II: When Punishment Feels Unjust</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claims to innocence by Abu-Jamal, by Peltier, and by their world-wide supporters, are well known.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many others are in a similar situation, however, if not because they are innocent, but because the forced experience of the mallet of prison-time, and the subsequent spirit-death, seem out of proportion to the wrong they have done. This is a second dimension of prison terror: to know you are wrong and fail in life, yet to be exposed to spirit-death for the error, a punishment often felt to be grossly unjust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One inmate in the system doing life for burglary, known only as John J., exclaims, &quot;I admit that I have a serious drug problem and am no angel - but I am </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an animal that needs to be locked up for the rest of his life!&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John J.'s situation, having a drug problem and now doing life for burglary, raises the question of who is being incarcerated today and for what. Politicians and pundits who justify the lockdown craze often argue that we are ridding our streets and neighborhoods of violent offenders and feared super-predators.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Actually, only 29% of all prison admissions are for violent offenses such as rape, murder, kidnapping, robbery, and assault.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other 71% are for various non-violent crimes: 31% for property offenses such as fraud, burglary, auto-theft, and larceny; another 30% for drug offenses (possession and trafficking); then, 9% more for public order offenses, like drunk-driving and arms possession.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is, that among the burgeoning number of our citizens exposed to spirit-death, the majority of these are not perpetrators of violent crime. I am not diminishing the seriousness of any of these crimes at this point. I am simply noting the sense of injustice felt by many who are experiencing spirit-death as punishment for committing non-violent crimes. In most cases, the terror is more than the error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dimension III: Racial Degradation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theatrics of terror in a big-house nation offer up a spectacle in living color, in more ways than we might like to think. Primarily, I have in mind the way our prisons are implicated in America's long-standing cruel sickness of white supremacism. Poor people of color, especially African Americans, are the majority of residents in today's carceral archipelago.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the year 2000, it is estimated that 1 in 10 black men will be in prison.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least one-third of all African-American men aged eighteen to thirty-four are under the supervision of the criminal justice system - in jail, prison, probation, parole, or court supervision.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present, although African Americans make up only 12% of this country's population,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> half of all prisoners are black according to Parenti,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 41% according to Wicker.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whoever has it right, the figures are wildly disproportionate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disparity of arrests, conviction, and incarceration of African Americans cannot be explained simply by greater incidence of crime in black communities. The disparity is so great now, as the National Criminal Justice Report has noted, that cumulative racial bias at all points of the criminal justice system must now be seen as the major cause of the disparity in our prisons.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This report minces no words in also warning that we risk social catastrophe with this disparity.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Virtually everyone in inner-city minority communities lives with the knowledge of having family in the prisons. Children often visit prisons to see loved ones more often than they have school field trips. Talk on the street is of a kind of a new age slavery, with predominantly black populations caged and housed in the prisons. Rappers refer to the big prisons as the new slave galleons of our time.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Street-talk about slavery today, is not pure hyperbole, given that when U.S. prisons emerged after slavery, they became the major way for continuing racist domination over black life and labor.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the 1996 National Criminal Justice Report summarizes, we are moving closer to a racial abyss that has little to do with the creation of a safe society.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n61</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gulag America is a special terror to black, Latino, and indigent communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dimension IV: Sexual Violation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prison world is also one of sexual violation. The theater of terror is inscribed into the very bodies of the confined. The media does, indeed, feature occasional discussion of prison-rape.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prison cinema often gives a glimpse of the violation. What is often overlooked is that prison culture is a systematically maintained and nurtured rape culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rape occurs systematically in our burgeoning prisons not only because prisons' denial of human contact is made worse today by greater restrictions on conjugal visits  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and healthy human touch. Nor is it only because of the deprivation of heterosexual interchange in prison environments. It is mainly because guards and supervisors use rape to divide and subdue the imprisoned population, which otherwise would be unmanageable. In other words, guards and supervisors connive with a thriving sex chattel system in which many men are made female sexual slaves, punks to other men.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, guards and supervisors themselves use powers over the imprisoned for their own sexual gratification, especially male guards supervising females.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parenti argues that there are roughly 200,000 male inmates in America raped every year, and many of them raped daily.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A movement in the prisons, called Stop Prisoner Rape,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> puts the figure at 290,000, noting that most studies of prison rape do not look at those who pair off for protection or at the high incidents of juvenile rape in facilities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The systematic, and officially sanctioned, dimensions of rape are dramatized by an account by Dr. James Gilligan, a doctor and psychiatrist working in the Massachusetts Department of Corrections.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>In one prison holding close to 700 inmates, one of the prison administrators, who was in a position to know, informed me that, out of that total number, probably no more than half a dozen men failed to engage in some form or other of regular sexual encounter with other men. How did he know that? Because in that prison an observation gallery overlooks every cell in the three tiers of its maximum-security wing so that the correction officers can observe what goes on within each and every cell.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The use of this sexual terror to divide and control the inmate population, is just one such use of violence for administrative purposes. It is further well-known that supervisors and guards also work with gangs internal to the prison system, using and encouraging ethnically-constituted groups against one another - such as the Aryan Brotherhood, the Black Guerrilla Family, Mexican Mafia, Bloods and Crips, et al.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - all with the aim of keeping the big house a veritable Balkans in a box.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is crucial to the maintenance of our carceral archipelago that terror be used to divide the imprisoned in these ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dimension V: Execution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theatrics of terror is dramatically played out also in those rooms where state-sanctioned executions take place. I believe we need to see the widespread use of the death penalty in the context of creating spectacles in a theatrics of terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1999, we have been executing citizens at a rate of two per week, with the total of the executed now being more than in any year in the last forty years.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With over 3500 on U.S. death rows now, the total is expected to be near or over 4000 people by the end of the year 2000.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With new laws expediting the death penalty taking effect by then, we could be seeing annual execution totals in the hundreds for a single year, two or three being dispatched in a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extensive use of the death penalty is a ritual enactment of the State's alleged right to take life, its right to hold power of life and death over its citizenry. Its major function is to register terror deep in the citizen unconscious.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This function persists, even while many debate the various theories of deterrence, retribution or today's most-popular just desserts theory (Ultimately, I do not think any of these hold up). The tremors of terror are felt, first of all, in the prison house itself, in which the death penalty is carried out. The tremors are also felt and evident in public attention that surrounds an execution. It is not uncommon for executions to attain the status of a spectacle, involving radio DJs and other talk-show commentators, and then also the pro- and anti-death penalty crowds outside the prison walls.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, we do not have the kinds of execution spectacles that we had with public hangings and ritualized torture of the past. The present mix, however, of shrouding and revealing the reports of execution has a function of rendering execution spectacular. It attains a mysterious, everyone-knows-about-it-but-doesn't-quite-know-about-it sensibility. Being both widely present and applied, and yet cloaked, executions take on a spectral awe. The carefully orchestrated release of information about executions might in fact be more effective than outright public display.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dimension VI: Paramilitary Policing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In close articulation with all the dimensions I have mentioned, we must note a final dimension of lockdown America and its theatrics of terror, paramilitary policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A whole host of other operations used by present U.S. authorities also mobilize spectacle and display awesome power. In the late 1980s, for example, massive and dramatic raids and sweeps by U.S. city police forces began a war on users of drugs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among these were Operation Sting in Miami (1986) tallying nearly 2600 arrests; Operation Snow Ball in Orange County, California (1986); Operation Clean Sweep in Washington, D.C. (1987) involving 28,000 arrests, catching 1,400 adolescents who were apprehended for minor dealing and possession; Operation Pressure Point in New York City (1987), where police once a week conducted sweeps, stings, and buy busts, cooperating with Federal agents.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps most famous was Operation Hammer in Los Angeles in which 14,000 people - mostly young black men - were arrested and booked in mobile command centers during a massive paramilitary occupation of south LA's deindustrialized ghettos.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More black youth were arrested here than at any time since the 1965 Watts Rebellion.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Kids are humiliatingly forced to kiss the sidewalk or spreadeagle against police cruisers while officers check their names against computerized files of gang members. . . . The kids are processed in mobile booking centers, mostly for trivial offences like delinquent parking tickets or curfew violations. Hundreds more, uncharged, have their names and addresses entered into the electronic gang roster for future surveillance.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As impressive as the simple number of arrests might be, it is the drama and spectacle of these inner city actions that is most important. The aim is to create a sense of drama, of total surveillance. As one sergeant of a California SWAT team said about sweeps, &quot;They see our big gray SWAT bus, and the weapons, and they know we mean business.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The logic is clear: knowing the seriousness of police plans is rooted in a spectacular seeing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interest in what Christian Parenti has called the political theatrics of terror has been extended in the 1990s from inner city U.S. neighborhoods, where it still continues, to the border region with Mexico. There, Operation Last Call,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a vigorous round-up of Mexican-looking people, occurred in Texas (1998). It was a state-wide assault by the INS and police agents, descending upon hundreds of homes, catching 116 immigrants in El Paso alone, over 600 more throughout the state. The captured included a few hardened criminals but, reportedly, just as many model, non-citizens.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practice is repeated throughout the country. The key is surprise and drama, especially sudden, unexpected violence. In 1996, border agents and local police used a massive mobile force to sweep through Jackson Hole, Wyoming, yanking Latino workers from restaurants, homes, and off their bicycles.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One hundred fifty-three of them were rounded up, confined in a holding pen, and then given ID numbers, scrawled on their forearms by large black markers. Over fifty were eventually released after this trauma when distraught family and friends could produce papers of proof. Those who could not were, according to local papers, transported to INS detention centers in a manure-strewn cattle truck.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (INS Detention centers, by the way, are a supplemental prison archipelago in the U.S.A. today holding 20,000 people who suffer conditions often criticized by Amnesty International for human rights violations.  n86) Parenti again expresses a concern here: &quot;The jumble of tropes at work in this real life allegory [in the Jackson Hole, WY operation] are as obvious as they are grotesque: mass arrests, numbered forearms, cattle cars . . . .&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employi</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>ng</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a theatrics of terror, through prisons, death penalties and paramilitary policing of cities and borders, presupposes an intent to do so. Without turning this essay into an explanation of all the historical causes of today's booming prison archipelago, I want to briefly clarify my own understanding as to why we are seeing this theatrics of terror.<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">II. WHY DO WE HAVE THE THEATRICS OF TERROR?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rise of big house nation, this house of terrors, is a kind of damage control. It seeks to control and contain those who are left behind by the American dream as a result of an increasing bifurcation between classes in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accompanying today's dream economy,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is an economic disparity documented again and again, most recently by Harvard sociologist, William Julius Wilson.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is actually a process that has developed across the better part of three decades, most intensively in the last two. The steady increase of U.S. government legislation and executive action, which has given rise to the present police-prison-death penalty structure, parallels a process of unusual concentration of wealth in U.S. upper classes.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National columnist and Republican campaign aid in 1968, Kevin Phillips, has analyzed the growing disparity of economic wealth and opportunity at the outset of the 1990s.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was marked by an increasing concentration of wealth in the upper 1% of the population. Between 1977 and 1997, the average family income for the lowest 10% of U.S. wage-earners dropped by 10.5%, while at the same time the upper 1% of the population (making an average of $ 174,498) actually increased their wealth by a whopping 74.2% in the decade.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recent studies by sociologist Wilson confirm these statistics.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While employment, inflation and growth still look good in this year's so-called economic boom, statistics on the real lives of people do not look so good. Household debt has increased for U.S. families from 59% of disposable income in 1973 to an astonishing 94.8% in 1997.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other indicators are also troubling. Over the last two decades, the U.S. has had the most rapid growth of wage inequality in the Western world.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of those without healthcare is on the increase, and the numbers of those not getting food stamps while living in poverty is on the rise.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. has the smallest and fastest shrinking middle class among the seventeen industrialized nations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While more wealth circulates in the United States than in any country in the world, a higher percentage of our citizens live in poverty than in the other industrialized countries.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Children's Defense Fund  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has just documented that according to its most recent studies of the government's own reports, over 400,000 new children slipped into extreme poverty, as many of the Republican Party's provisions for cutting welfare and social services in its Contract with America,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began to take effect under President Clinton's signature.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With this kind of bifurcation of the class terrain in the United States, systems that seek to maintain social order go into overdrive. The bifurcation of wealth creates wreckage that needs to be dealt with. In the 1970s, criminologist Steven Spitzer divided this wreckage into two types, social junk and social dynamite.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social junk (a deplorable term for any human) refers to those whose lives are broken and beaten: the mentally ill, alcoholics, drug addicts, cast-offs, impoverished seniors, lonely and beaten drifters. When systems no longer are geared to care for such ones as these, then you need mechanisms to get them out of the way. They must be driven away from the beaches, malls, and shopping areas of resort towns, financial districts, and the pleasure zones of theme park cities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These rarely pose a threat to the system, but their very being is a kind of ontological marker of a problem in a system. They rarely unite and orchestrate a potent resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a different matter with the social dynamite. This is a part of the population also left behind by class bifurcation, but who threaten to explode. Included here are the impoverished low-wage working class and unemployed youth  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who often are not picked up by statistics, but whose spirits are not bowed and broken and who intend to be socially included and will fight to be so. In other words, social dynamite </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">does</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> constitute a very real threat to the system, especially to a system made up of class and racial hierarchies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These groups have always been with us. They include the Black Panthers and the Young Lords of the sixties, and later gangs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 1930s there were the councils of the unemployed that forcibly stopped evictions in New York's Lower East Side.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controlling social dynamite yields the kind of policing, imprisoning, and executing we see today. Parenti's words are again effective:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Controlling [social dynamite] requires both a defensive policy of containment and an aggressive policy of direct attack and active destabilization. They are contained and crushed, confined to the ghetto, demoralized and pilloried in warehouse public schools, demonized by a lurid media, sent to prison, and at times dispatched by lethal injection or police bullets. This is the class - or more accurately the caste, because they are increasingly people of color - which must be constantly undermined, divided, intimidated, attacked, discredited and ultimately kept in check with what [Frantz] Fanon called the language of naked force.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the need for this naked force to control the social wreckage of economic disparity, which accounts for why we see a political theatrics of terror in paramilitary policing, runaway prison-building, and ready-use of the death penalty. It is a sinister combination of forces that makes up lockdown America. We might appreciate, then, those biblical texts that render a severe judgment on prisons.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chaplain Lee Griffith pointed out that prisons in the Bible are not just one of many social institutions that may be more or less effective in pursuing the various goals assigned them.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No, they are seen as identical in spirit to the violence and murder they pretend to combat. Recall the Psalmist lamenting with the prisoners in misery and chains, dwelling in darkness,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or urging upon us not to neglect God's own, not despising His who are prisoners.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prison in the scriptures is a symbol of the power of death, its cells of confinement and death are like the entrance holes to Sheol  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the underworld. Indeed, intensive control units of maximum security are called the hole. When the executed Jesus of Nazareth proclaimed liberty for the captives, this was not just an isolated saying; it stands as a renunciation of the power of death.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How shall this liberty be practiced?<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">III. TOWARD A THEATRICS OF COUNTER-TERROR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic inequality and the plight of the poor have long been, and always must be, crucial concerns of prophetic churches. When, however, this economic disparity is reinforced by a political theatrics of terror as we see today, then the church's witness must find a still more forceful mode of active witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remembrance and meditation on the executed God cannot only revise our understanding of God, but also our way of action, to find our own way through the terror of lockdown America. In short, the executed God gives rise to a whole spirituality of liberating practice. I call this practice a theatrics of counter-terror. In more common Christian language, it is a way of carrying your cross. It is also, more accurately, perhaps, a way of wielding your cross for liberating struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theatrics is the art of theater, the art of dramatic performance. At present in lockdown America, the powerful owners of wealth (and their political collaborators) are mastering this art better than most Christians. Christians need to go about the task of constructing a theater of actions, oriented by Jesus of Nazareth's mode of being in the world, concretely unleashing forces to counter today's theatrics of terror. What would this involve?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firstly, a theatrics of counter-terror is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">adversarial</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, i.e., it concerns a conflictive, contentious opposition. This opposition is most dramatically symbolized in the Markan narrative about the moment of Jesus' death. After Jesus' cry of dereliction, the rending of the temple curtain, after a report of Jesus' breathing his last, then, in that moment of Jesus' death, a voice says this man was (note the past tense) the Son of God.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The voice was that of a Roman soldier, a centurion. He later reappears in Mark's text to confirm personally Jesus' death to Rome's Pontius Pilate.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether you follow a tradition that sees the centurion as making here a confession of faith in that moment, or as quietly, with authority (maybe with even a bit of imperial gloating), marking the triumph of Rome over another challenger, the point is that Mark presents an opposition: Jesus and the Roman Empire. It is God revealed on a cross over and against the power of the empire, a state power whose brutality is marked by the tool of torture upon which Jesus of Nazareth was executed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This executed One, raged over and against empire, introduces fundamental confrontation between God and faithfulness to the God of Jesus, on one side, and the empire and its punitive measures, on the other. Even if one prefers a pacifist reading of Jesus, and holds to Christian discipleship that would never condone violence, this still does not destroy the adversarial character of the cross. As Jon Sobrino said about the crucified God and about crucified peoples in today's world: there are victims, and there are executioners.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus' politics were not those of a typical, anti-imperialist revolutionary, known then or now. But he had a politic, and it could be politically adversarial as displayed in the crucifixion scene. The way he believed, taught and acted, questioned the Empire, directly or indirectly.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of how revolutionary we might render Jesus' life and various actions, the cross of the executed One makes a crucial contribution to what I am calling a theatrics of counter-terror. It provokes a decision about imperial power. To exist counter to today's politics of terror, to have a politics of counter-terror, entails this adversarial frame of confrontation, contestation, and resistance. An adversarial stance and resistance to empire, then, is birthed from the very center of Christianity, the executed Jesus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, a Christian theatrics of counter-terror is also </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">mimetic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, i.e., it is action rendered in creative and imaginative art. Mimesis is a term used not only for imitation, but for artistic representation more generally. A theatrics of counter-terror is mimetic, it resists imperial terror with dramatic representation. It seeks its own spectacular character to resist the terrorizing spectacles of empire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crucifixion, as originally designed and employed was not just gruesome, it was meant to be a dramatic act. It was a spectacle to behold. Crucifixion was a Roman form of a public service announcement: do not engage in sedition as this person has, or your fate will be similar.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Josephus makes the point that crucifixions were often used as spectacles to induce Jewish surrender or to create fear for reducing Jewish resistance to empire.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Fredriksen's recent study is correct, Jesus was probably executed because of his capacity to catalyze crowds who hungered to see Roman defeat, especially at the Passover in Jerusalem.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He, like many before and after him, was one of whom Rome made a spectacle. By such means as this, Rome sought to consolidate its power. Yet, from the perspective of the gospel's passion narratives,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the time of whose writing the resurrection stories were also circulating, and from the many Christian narratives later written  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - from these perspectives, I suggest, the spectacle made of Jesus before the Jerusalem crowds did not yield the consolidation of imperial power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Granted, decades and centuries would have to elapse before the point could be grasped, but there is a sense in which the Christians, with their many new narratives of death and resurrection, stole the show. The spectacle of crucifixion, which long functioned for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Pax Romana</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to quash courage and resistance, became a narrative about a divine victory over Roman power. The executed Jesus, as narratively represented as executed God, as resurrected One and Lord of history, displaces Rome, while still leaving the crucifixion spectacle in place. Rome is rendered by its own cross of torture into an interim power. Christian remembrance transforms a spectacle of intimidation and terror into a spectacle of counter-terror. The spectacle of the cross is wielded against Rome, opening the way to a life where no more terrorizing crosses should have legitimate place. That is to steal the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid today's political theatrics of terror, Christians must again find a way to steal the show, to forge their own drama, their own spectacle of counter-terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way to interpret the power of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s effort,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is to see it as the stealing and transformation of terrorizing spectacle. The South was pervaded by a complex ethos of segregation marked by signs saying--&quot;Whites Only here. Coloreds Only there.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When an Emmet Till  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or anyone else stepped out of line, their beating, killing, firebombing, and lynching were designed to be exemplary, and they made still more potent the daily, terrorizing spectacle of racist domination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King and the civil rights movement usurped the power of spectacle from racist structures; they stole the show. Believing that a kingdom of love and justice, of universal humanity (the kingdom of God) was greater than the kingdom of white supremacist America, he renounced both the racist goals and the tactics of terrorizing violence. King dramatically confronted terrorizing racist power, on site - marching on the back roads and bridges, in the neighborhoods where people could not vote, in city centers, and in the nation's capitol.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In so doing, racist power was provoked, some receptive powers accommodated peoples' demands, and television intensified the events by extending the experience of spectacle, creating a widespread sense of revulsion at racist powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonviolence, as used by King or by any others, will always be preferred as the mimesis for a theatrics of counter-terror, because only non-violence is a real alternative to the terrorizing violence of repressive powers. This preference, though, in the Christian theatrics of counter-terror I envision, is not rooted in a simple, blanket renunciation of violence. It is rooted primarily in an act of imagination, the creative envisioning of an alternative way of being a kingdom of God, which is always near but also always not yet. Moreover, from that kingdom comes the resources of contestation. From that kingdom comes a theater of contestation where the mimesis of love and justice gives rise to dramatic, strategic acts. The imaginative crafting of these is often more demanding of energy by agents of change, and more powerful in their effects, than simple taking up of arms against enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would also say that when Christians - on behalf of, or as, oppressed peoples - do find no option other than taking up arms, then we will not realize even our own aspirations apart from some mimesis, some dramatic, artistic mode of practice. The example of the Maya Zapatistas of 1994,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tying white strips of cloth around their gun barrels, comes to mind. These dramatized, they said, their wish to discontinue use of those weapons. Indeed, they have gone largely unused since 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Haitian-American Abner Louima was brutalized by New York City police officers in a Brooklyn nightclub restroom, as they used the end of a toilet plunger to destroy his rectum and teeth, Haitian-Americans flowed across the Brooklyn Bridge in a march of rage.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a nonviolent protest, but it was made especially adversarial and effective by activists using a Haitian cultural mimesis. They used art to mimic and mock, express rage, and to break-down terrorizing ways of the more powerful and brutal organized forces. Haitians showed up with toilet plungers, not as tools for vengeful brutality, but as props in moving street theater. They wore plungers on their heads, marching with mock police billy clubs that looked like pathetic phalluses. The powers were impressed and intimidated by the march. The spectacle was especially influential in keeping the case from disappearing from public attention as such cases often do. It also helped mobilize public opinion on police brutality, generally moving the issue onto the front pages of some national magazines.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is exemplary of a theatrics of counter-terror, wielding mimesis to steal the power of spectacle from ruling powers. The Haitian-American example of mimesis in the streets against police terror, is just one example of the theft of a spectacular symbol - the brutal toilet plunger returning, a thousand-fold, into the Manhattan city district from poorer Brooklyn. It is exemplary of the kind of show-stealing theatrics that we need in order to forge a theatrics of counter-terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, a theatrics of counter-terror is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">kinetic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it pertains to, or is produced by, motion. The moving (kinetic) character of a theatrics of counter-terror is also implicit in the notion of the executed God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus of Nazareth, even without embracing political readings of his gospel, is best understood as having been executed because of the way his proclamation of an alternative, near kingdom, engaged a tumultuous kinetic scene. Paula Fredriksen, who sees the historical Jesus as neither primarily a social reformer with a revolutionary message, nor a religious innovator of his tradition, still emphasizes that the kingdom-message embodied in his person is what moved the crowds at the politicized tumult of Jerusalem Passover.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This directly led to his crucifixion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Note the kinetic qualities of the scene Fredriksen describes: the crowds met him during the pilgrimage feast in the city of David at Passover, in all the excitement, panoply, and ritual reenactment of the holiday that commemorated the liberation and redemption of their people.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executed God also entails kinetic qualities in the movement and movements catalyzed by Jesus' death. The message about a near kingdom of God, alternative to the empire, spread throughout the villages of Judea and the Galilee, running up the coast to cities ringing the Mediterranean through the network of Greek-speaking synagogue communities of Asia Minor.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The movement went on to become what sociologist Rodney Stark described as one of the most successful revitalization movements in history.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stark is a little too quick to dismiss the revolutionary potential of the Gospel for appealing to proletarian and beaten proletarian groups,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but he argues that Christianity succeeded, in large part, because of a capacity to emphasize central doctrines that prompted sustained and attractive, liberating and effective social relations and organizations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n136</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Especially under the conditions of devastating epidemics, urban disorder, and widespread poverty, early Christians distinguished themselves for putting in place a care for the poor, as part of both their witness and worship.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n137</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paul Johnson has suggested that Christian efforts, spontaneous and organized, had given rise to a miniature welfare state in an empire which, for the most part, lacked social services.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n138</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Princeton's political scientist, Michael Doyle, points out that this kind of saintly calling might have sapped the military and civic power of the ancient world's imperial aspirations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n139</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In short, the executed God moves within and against empire. A theatrics of counter-terror, moving out from the executed God, is to be found not just in occasional, adversarial events, even if rendered dramatically as mimesis, but in these as also organized social movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When churches fail to exhibit organized movements of counter-terrorism, or even to participate in them wholeheartedly, they not only fail to embody a theatrics of counter-terror in our time, they also betray the kinetic, moving quality of the crucified/executed God. Karl Barth, at age eighty, evidently still looking for some adversarial exercise, challenged Christians to organize a movement against the nuclear armament of West Germany, against the Vietnam War, against continuing anti-Semitism, and for peace with East European socialist states: &quot;If your just confession of Christ dead and resurrected . . . does not include this and does not express it,&quot; he intoned, &quot;such confession is no good despite its justness.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n140</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So essential is organized movement to Christian faith, that when the churches fail (and even when they do not), it is necessary to seek the executed God in movements at the edges of church communities, alongside them, or even outside of them. Moltmann made a similar point when he reminded us that those whose liberating action is faithful to the crucified God, to the executed rebel Jesus, automatically find themselves cooperating with other freedom movements in God's history.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n141</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hence, he calls for a political hermeneutics of dialogue with socialist, democratic, humanistic, and anti-racist movements.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n142</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interestingly, when visiting the Princeton Seminary faculty last year, he emphasized the need for a globalized liberation theology.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n143</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That globalized liberation theology, however, needs to be at work here at home, in the belly of the United States, where a political theatrics of terror is at work. Fortunately, I believe the executed God, carried in a theatrics of counter-terror, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">is</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at work today - not only being adversaries to state-sanctioned terror, but doing so with mimetic drama, and kinetic movement. It is still not enough, but there are signs, and they are signs of hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are groups confronting police brutality and paramilitary swashbuckling tactics that have made police brutality epidemic in this country.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n144</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have mentioned already the movement around Abner Louima. There were also the dramatic civil disobedience actions in New York City following the killing of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Ghanaian student shot at forty-five times by police, nineteen of the bullets killing him while he was standing in his own apartment lobby.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n145</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hundreds of protestors, including dignitaries and also Christian and Jewish seminary students from New York and New Jersey, were arrested.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n146</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is the October 22 Coalition,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n147</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> whose Stolen Lives Project  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n148</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> painfully and dramatically documents and displays the growing number of lives, mostly black and Latino, lost to police brutality. Some of these movements have church support, though generally, churches are reluctant to challenge police authority. There are exceptions, as with Imani Presbyterian Church's role in founding the Save Our Children Coalition [&quot;SOCC'] in Trenton, New Jersey. The SOCC went on to support an African-American mayor's effort to put a citizen commissioner over a police department that seemed cavalier about its shootings of black youth.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n149</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theatrics of counter-terror is at work in groups confronting the death penalty. There, mimesis is evident in liturgies at the prison wall when executions go down, in their narrating and remembering the lives of all the 3500 plus on America's death rows, in marching and making a spectacle of American's barbaric practice, especially around the globally note-worthy case of Mumia Abu-Jamal on Pennsylvania's death row. A theatrics of counter-terror against capital punishment takes on a markedly Christian dramatic form in the actions organized by Princeton Seminary students, to hold vigils against the death penalty at the Trenton State capitol, each Holy Saturday, between Good Friday and Easter.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n150</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A theatrics of counter-terror is growing still among groups who confront America's prison-industrial complex--the big house nation, the American Gulag. One of the most inspiring and effective movements that I see here today, features the elements of creative mimesis and adversarial contention that also are crucial to a theatrics of counter-terror. This is the movement of the Prison Justice Caravans, 2 to 4 in number, which will snake their way across prison-land America, for a five day encampment in Washington, D.C., to culminate and consolidate their witness to a new vision amid present prison injustice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its drama of caravans and encampments, the movement is especially mimetic. The drama will be heightened by the presentation of mothers, children, and parents of the needlessly imprisoned, including a mother of a son who is among the 500 on Texas' death row, the father of a child killed in the Oklahoma City bombing  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n151</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who speaks out against the death penalty, clergy, teachers, and laity challenging the ethical foundations of our lock 'em up and throw away the key policies, and labor activists challenging the no-pay or low-pay prison labor practices. Putting those folks on the road, caravan style, is the kind of mimesis we need in our movements if we are to build a theatrics of counter-terror. It remains to be seen if these caravans can steal the show, interrupt the media and politicians whose racial stereotypes and get tough on crime rhetoric is often the major spectacle of the times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first trait of a theatrics of counter-terror, its adversarial posture, is also present. Through these caravans, the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organizing [&quot;IFCO&quot;]  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n152</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is challenging the entire country's reliance on professionalized, corporatized prison terror. This is not just about getting more theology students some jobs as chaplains in prisons to teach a few courses there, hold a few hands, and maybe pray with a few thousand more executees before they walk down the shiny hallways of America's Gulag to their deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, in the manner of the executed God, IFCO challenges all America to cast its lot with victims of executioners, ultimately with all of us who are victims of a theatrics of prison terror. IFCO's goal is broad and deep, as a theatrics of real counter-terror needs to be. It challenges prison build up and institutionalized terror as what it is: non-justifiable, a malignant disease that is eating away at the core of our entire society.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n153</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, it would be easy to settle for serving those Christians that tolerate or make common cause with the powers of this age now spreading terror in lockdown America. We do better to live out a theatrics of counter-terror, remembering the executed God, breaking down the American Gulag, and restoring all the peoples to life.</SPAN></P>

The demonstrators, affiliated with the human rights group Amnesty International, held banners listing the 468 people who have been executed in the United States since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Noa Kleinman, Amnesty's coordinator for the United States and Canada, said the rally was intended to show support for recent anti-death penalty demonstrations outside the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington. Capital punishment is allowed in 38 U.S. states. The protesters also wanted to draw attention to the case of Kenneth Richey, currently on death row in an Ohio prison awaiting the outcome of his federal court appeals.</SPAN></P>

One of the local boys then dared Emmett Till to speak to the white woman (Carolyn Bryant) in the store. According to Curtis Jones, Emmett went back inside the store and bought more candy, saying &quot;Bye, baby&quot; to the white woman as he left. Curtis Jones, Emmett Till and the other boys jumped in their car as Carolyn Bryant came out the swinging screen doors and sped out of town. News of the incident quickly spread among the local black youth and Emmett and Curtis were warned to leave town before the woman's husband found out. But a week passed without the threatened retribution. Then, in the &quot;wee hours of the morning&quot; of August 28, 1955, Mose Wright was awakened by a knock on his door. Upon opening, two white men (later identified as J. W. Milam and his half-brother Roy Bryant) asked him for the &quot;nigger here from Chicago&quot;, the boy &quot;that did all the talking.&quot; Emmett Till then was abducted at gunpoint. Mrs. Wright, trying to come up for his defense, was struck in the head with the side of a shotgun. Four days later, Emmett's mutilated body, with a [75]-pound cotton gin fan tied around his neck with barbed wire, was found at the bottom of the Tallahatchie river.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8"> LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ...  Racially motivated police harassment, vis-a-vis racial profiling, is as American as baseball and apple pie. ...  Second, racial profiling - equating race with criminality and using it in the absence of and in lieu of probable cause - is legally impermissible. ...

<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INTRODUCTION<BR>&nbsp;<BR> It has been said that in life but two things are certain: death and taxes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you are a young African-American or Latino male, however, there is an additional certainty: At some point during your lifetime, you will be harassed by the police. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Racially motivated police harassment, vis-a-vis racial profiling, is as American as baseball and apple pie. And it has been around, in some form or fashion, for most of America's history. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Racial profiling happens to consumers and pedestrians, on planes, trains, and automobiles. There is driving while black (or brown), flying while black, walking while black, shopping while black, hailing (as in a cab) while black, swimming while black (six African-American youths accused of stealing a cell phone and beeper at a public pool in Michigan) and dining while black (think Miami, where a tip was automatically added to the bill of a black patron, on the assumption that blacks are poor tippers), to name a few. The most accurate term to describe the pervasiveness of the phenomenon is breathing while black, a reality underscored by the shooting deaths over a thirteen-month period - by the New &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*372]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  York Police Department alone - of four unarmed black men, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Patrick Dorismond, Malcolm Ferguson and Richard Watson. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARGUMENT<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Any way you slice it, racial profiling is wrong. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, it is morally indefensible, steeped as it is in racial stereotypes and erroneous assumptions about the propensity of black and Latino men to commit particular types of crimes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, racial profiling - equating race with criminality and using it in the absence of and in lieu of probable cause - is legally impermissible. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It violates various constitutional and statutory rights, including the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Finally, racial profiling is just bad, ineffective policing. By targeting black and Latino men, practitioners of racial &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*373]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  profiling ignore the reality that others are committing crimes (especially those involving the transport of drugs on the nation's highways) and are largely being allowed to get away with it. Additionally, the societal costs exacted by racial profiling, including jury nullification and the lack of faith in the justice system, are immeasurable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DISCUSSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Immorality of Racial Profiling<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Racial profiling is morally indefensible. Under the guise of good policing, racial profilers stereotype and penalize African-Americans and Latinos solely on the basis of their skin color. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even conceding that, as with all races, some small percentage of African-Americans and Latinos are committing crimes, racially motivated policing punishes everyone for the sins of a few. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So widespread is racial profiling that Harvard Law School Professor Randall Kennedy, in his book Race, Crime, and the Law, likens it to a tax levied against black men: &quot;[A] young black man selected for questioning by police as he alights from an airplane or drives a car is being made to pay a type of racial tax for the war against drugs that whites and other groups escape.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In attempting to justify racial profiling, its proponents frequently demonize people of color, often employing hateful and vitriolic rhetoric. Last year, for example, New Jersey State Police Superintendent Carl Williams said to a newspaper that &quot;mostly minorities&quot; traffic in marijuana and cocaine and that &quot;the president of the United States went to Mexico to talk to the president of Mexico about drugs. He didn't go to Ireland. He didn't go to England.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fortunately for motorists of color traveling the roads of New Jersey, he was fired soon thereafter. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another example, white separatist Jared Taylor told an annual meeting of the National Association of Police Organizations that law-enforcement officers were justified in using racial profiling during police traffic stops. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*374]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taylor, who has called diversity &quot;unnatural&quot; and said on his Web site that whites face &quot;the prospect of oblivion,&quot; said that profiling was &quot;common sense&quot; because blacks commit violent crimes more than whites. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Likewise, Marshall Frank, a retired police officer defended racial profiling by resorting to racist and inaccurate assumptions about the make of cars people drove, the type of clothes they wore, and the neighborhoods they visited. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the editorial, Frank, referring to people as &quot;dirt-bags,&quot; said, &quot;Label me a racist if you wish.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He displayed no concern whatever about condemnation for his racist beliefs. One can only imagine the lessons he passed on to the officers in his charge during his thirty years as an officer. Even more frightening is the untold number of motorists who likely fell victim to his shameless beliefs. Those sentiments, thankfully, are at great odds with what most Americans believe today. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another factor illustrating the morally shallow ground upon which racial profiling rests is the all-too-common failure of its proponents seriously to appreciate or care about the deleterious effects racial profiling has on its victims. Motorists penalized for driving while black or brown will, at the very least, be inconvenienced. Frequently, the experience will be frightening, humiliating or even traumatic. Sometimes, the episode will be deadly. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shooting of three African-American and Latino youths on the New Jersey Turnpike by New Jersey State Troopers in 1998 demonstrates that the lives of young black and Latino men mean little or nothing to officers who have sworn an oath to protect everyone. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, the Marshall Franks of the world justify racial profiling on the ground that it is &quot;better to be safe than sorry.&quot; Such &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*375]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  callous disregard for the safety and well-being of profiling victims begs an obvious question: safer for whom?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illegality of Racial Profiling<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Beyond being immoral, racial profiling is also illegal. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids unequal treatment on the basis of race. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate racial discrimination emanating from official sources in the States.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Equal Protection Clause &quot;is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Racial profiling, which targets people of color on the basis of nothing more than their race and subjects them to differential treatment, stands in direct contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment's mandates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are several ways for a plaintiff to plead intentional race discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause: a plaintiff could point to a law or policy that expressly classifies persons on the basis of race; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*376]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a plaintiff could identify a facially neutral policy that has been applied in an intentionally discriminatory manner; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or a plaintiff could allege that a facially neutral statute or policy has an adverse effect and that it was motivated by discriminatory animus. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Racial profiling cases are likely to contain allegations of an express racial classification. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial profiling also violates the Fourth Amendment, which is designed to protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the context of vehicular stops, an investigative stop of an automobile &quot;must be justified by some objective manifestation that the person stopped is, or is about to be, engaged in criminal activity.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other words, some level of reasonable suspicion is required. The law enforcement officer conducting the stop must be able to &quot;point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from these facts, reasonably warrant&quot; stopping a person to conduct further investigation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For automobile searches, while a warrant is not required, probable cause to believe that the car contains contraband is still a prerequisite. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Probable cause means &quot;a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found.'&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the absence of probable cause, a search warrant, or exigent circumstances, a search will be deemed legal only if it is conducted with the consent of the party searched. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*377]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Depending upon the nature and severity of the encounter, allegations generally will be that defendants violated the Fourth Amendment by stopping a motorist of color without reasonable suspicion, searching him and his vehicle without probable cause, detaining him for unreasonably long periods of time, coercing consent to search or searching without consent, and deploying a drug-sniffing dog for an intrusive and unjustified search. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claims also may exist under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations, which prohibit discrimination by agencies receiving federal funding. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Significantly, while Title VI itself bars only intentional discrimination, its implementing regulations also prohibit practices that have an unjustified disparate impact. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although claims based upon the constitutional right to travel have yet to meet with much success in racial profiling cases, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> under the right circumstances, a racial profiling litigant may prevail. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, depending upon the factual circumstances surrounding the profiling incident, various torts, including false imprisonment, assault and battery, and intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress, also may be alleged, as well as conspiracy and state statutory claims. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*378]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Inefficiency of Racial Profiling<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In addition to being immoral and illegal, racial profiling is bad policing, failing to reduce crime - some say even breeding it - and exacting immeasurable costs upon society. Time and again, studies have shown that racial profiling, to combat crime generally and in service of the War on Drugs, in particular, is simply ineffective. For example, federal statistics show that African-Americans are 13 percent of the country's drug users (equivalent to their composition in the American population), yet African-Americans constitute 37 percent of those arrested on drug charges, 55 percent of those convicted on drug charges, and 74 percent of all drug offenders sentenced to prison. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former Attorney General of New Jersey has called this phenomenon the &quot;perverse illogic&quot; of racial profiling: when people of color are targeted and searched at a grossly disproportionate rate, it is only logical that they will be arrested and incarcerated at a commensurately high rate. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the 87 percent of drug users who are NOT African-American are for the most part left alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Maryland, statistics by the Maryland State Police show that black and white motorists were found to have drugs at an equal rate of 28 percent, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that blacks were 73 percent of those stopped and searched, despite being only 17.5 percent of those committing traffic violations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*379]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not only does racial profiling fail miserably in an arguably well-intentioned but poorly executed effort to rid America of drugs, its societal costs are extraordinary. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For one thing, people of color &quot;individually and as a community are psychologically harmed.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The costs to society also include the perpetuation of inaccurate stereotypes, which in turn produces &quot;exaggerated levels of fear and more pronounced levels of scapegoating.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fundamentally,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>race-based policies pit law enforcement against minorities and create an unbreakable cycle: racial stereotypes may motivate police to arrest Blacks more frequently. This in turn generates statistically disparate arrest patterns, which in turn form the basis for further police selectivity by race. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Racial profiling also results in the refusal by some people of color to cooperate with police investigations, to disbelieve police officers who are testifying against a criminal defendant and to employ jury nullification when serving on juries. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Professor David Cole, racially discriminatory law enforcement practices</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>undermine law enforcement itself, because they breed resentment and alienation among minorities... People who see the criminal justice system as fundamentally unfair will be less likely to cooperate with police, to testify as witnesses, to serve on juries, and to convict guilty defendants when they do &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*380]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  serve. In addition, people who have lost respect for the law's legitimacy are more likely to break the law themselves... Finally, the perception and reality of a fundamentally unfair criminal justice system contribute to broader racial divisions in society. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Even judges, finding racial profiling at play, have suppressed evidence, reduced sentences or refused to convict in criminal cases. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCLUSION<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Racial profiling &quot;operates like a deadly cancer on our justice system.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It eats away at the very liberties which have made America the greatest country in the world: &quot;the freedom to go about our business without unwarranted police interference and the right to be treated equally before the law, without regard to race or ethnicity.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Law enforcement agencies expend limited resources unsuccessfully targeting black and Latino citizens in their failed efforts carrying out the War on Drugs. In so doing, racial profilers trample upon the civil, constitutional and human rights of people of color, most often without apology and increasingly with tragic consequences. Those who are targeted, part of the largest growing segments of the American population, in turn regard police officers and the justice system, generally, with suspicion and skepticism. Some go so far as to resist helping a police investigation; some will even nullify verdicts. To most Americans, the Civil Rights Movement, led by Martin Luther King, Jr., signified a sea of change in the fight for racial equality. Dr. King's philosophy exalted nonviolence and brotherhood over hate and brute force and called for the equal treatment of all Americans. Dr. King &quot;s plea was simple: that all individuals be judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Racial profiling is incontrovertible evidence that we are not yet there.</SPAN></P>

See generally Driving While Black: Racial Profiling on our Nation's Highways, American Civil Liberties Union Special Report, May 1999, available at http:www.aclu.org/profiling/rport/index.html. Where abusive and excessive police practices were once conducted on the sly, the War on Drugs has virtually sanctioned the public, systematic, and unapologetic violation of civil liberties. Add to this a society still struggling with stereotypes involving race and crime, and the inevitable result is that people of color are those bearing the brunt of these abusive practices. But see Ellis Cose, The Rage of a Privileged Class 107 (1993) (asserting that history teaches that racism and stereotypes preceded a black underclass who commit a disproportionate amount of crime, thereby undermining the argument that race-based law enforcement is merely a reaction to that reality). </SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c12">n7.&nbsp; For the first time, in 1999, the term &quot;racial profiling&quot; made its way into the dictionary. The Oxford American Dictionary and Language Guide defines &quot;racial profiling&quot; as the &quot;alleged police policy of stopping and searching vehicles driven by people from particular racial groups.&quot; With appropriate respect, this author disagrees with this definition, because, as discussed above, racial profiling occurs in non-vehicular contexts as well. The Oxford American Dictionary's definition of &quot;racial profiling&quot; is a more appropriate definition for &quot;driving while black&quot; or &quot;d.w.b.,&quot; which also made the dictionary for the first time in 1999. Random House Webster's College Dictionary defines &quot;d.w.b.&quot; as: &quot;Driving While Black (used ironically to refer to the stoppage of a black motorist by police because of the motorist's race rather than for any real offense).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Other commentators also have offered a definition of &quot;racial profiling.&quot; For example, Harvard Law School Professor Randall Kennedy urges a broad definition of racial profiling, consistent with present-day police practices: &quot;using race as a factor [not the sole factor] in deciding whom to place under suspicion and/or surveillance.&quot; Randall Kennedy, Suspect, The New Republic, Sept. 13 &amp; 20, 1999, at 35 (emphasis added). </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8"> LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ...  When the Supreme Court voted to review the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court holding Chicago's &quot;gang loitering&quot; ordinance invalid on federal constitutional grounds, it seemed plausible that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">City of Chicago v Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be the occasion for a major statement from the Court on a set of complex issues--issues including not only the nature of the police officer's authority to maintain order in public places, but also the relative roles of politics and judicial decision making in delineating both the limits on this authority and the latitude left to police to employ discretion in its exercise. ...  Based on this finding, a council member in 1992 might well have proposed an ordinance authorizing police to order any person reasonably believed to be a gang member to depart from any neighborhood in which he might be found loitering so as to intimidate others from using public spaces. ...  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority suggested (without explicitly affirming) that limiting the criminal penalties in Chicago's gang loitering law to gang members alone might well cure the vagueness problem identified in the ordinance. ...  If the problem with the Chicago ordinance is really the one identified by the majority (namely, that the vagueness permeating the law creates too great an opportunity for its arbitrary enforcement), it makes little sense to argue that limiting the criminal penalties in Chicago's gang loitering law to gang members alone &quot;solves&quot; the problem. ...  Certainly when the implementation of a challenged public order law is built into such an organizational framework--a framework dedicated to &quot;securing month-in, month-out accountability to residents for what beat officers are doing&quot;--this is a relevant factor to consider in assessing the likelihood that this law will be employed in an arbitrary and capricious way. ... &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

After all, communities today are experimenting with a broad variety of new policing styles.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of these experiments have emphasized the importance of a neighborhood's public spaces to the health of its community and have involved police in efforts to improve the &quot;quality of life&quot; in such spaces. Police have seen to the removal of trash and abandoned cars along streets where children play. There has been a revival of interest in the enforcement of statutes and ordinances aimed at low-level public disorder. In some places, this local experimentation has produced a new confidence &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*142]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  among community residents in the ability of police to contribute to the well-being of the neighborhoods they serve. Elsewhere, however, police initiatives directed at crime and disorder have generated concern, anxiety, and outright anger about police intrusiveness, particularly as directed at minority populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a coalition that ultimately included prominent scholars, community activists, and the Solicitor General (not to mention various city attorneys, state attorneys general, and law enforcement groups) attacked the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court for being badly out of touch both with the legitimate aspiration of inner city residents to reclaim control over their neighborhoods and with the capacity of these residents, freed from the ineffective attempts of courts to restrain unreasonable police actions, themselves to impose meaningful political controls over the conduct of police.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others, meanwhile, fiercely contended that the Chicago ordinance was a frank invitation to arbitrary and discriminatory police enforcement; they called upon the Supreme Court to resist the siren song of &quot;community&quot; and &quot;neighborhood empowerment&quot; and to hold the line against a serious threatened erosion in constitutional liberties.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, then, seemed to advocates on &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*143]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  both sides the proper occasion for a significant Supreme Court pronouncement--a pronouncement either reaffirming and clarifying the application of existing constitutional doctrines to the host of loitering ordinances, curfews, and other &quot;order maintenance&quot; laws recently adopted in many local communities or, instead, setting the nation's courts on a new course with regard to the review of such laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viewed from this perspective, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must be deemed disappointing to everyone. In Justice Stevens's lead opinion, which was joined in full by only two Justices and in part by three others, six Justices agreed, narrowly, that Chicago's gang loitering ordinance was impermissibly vague in its authorization to police to disperse gang members and those accompanying them whenever these people were found &quot;loitering&quot; (defined in the ordinance to mean &quot;remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose&quot;) in public spaces.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite arguments by supporters of the ordinance that such a holding would do little to realize the principal ambition the Court has articulated for its vagueness doctrine--namely, setting meaningful limits on the opportunity for arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement--the Court failed to clarify the rationale for this doctrine or to explain how its application to the Chicago ordinance would promote the wise use of discretion by Chicago police.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, the Court's parsimonious holding did not offer opponents of the ordinance anything like a robust defense of vagueness doctrine nor of its application to public order laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be too hasty, though, simply to dismiss </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as yet another case in which the Court has evaded--or at least failed to come to grips with--important issues concerning the relationship between local police and their communities. After all, the issue in the background of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">--namely, the proper role for police patrol in a community--is extraordinarily complex, implicating, as it does, not only the law enforcement role of police, but also the role of police officers as peacekeepers and providers of a multitude of community services. Should patrol officers seek to deter crime and ameliorate disorder largely through their visible, uniformed &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*144]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  presence in public places, or should they adopt a more proactive posture? If they should be more proactive, what should they do? Enforce laws? Mediate conflicts? Serve as ombudsmen to address a broad variety of problems in the provision of governmental services? And if we are to authorize a significant category of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">coercive</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> encounters between patrol officers and people found in public places, how do we guard against the abuse of this authority? How do we ensure that the grant of authority to police to serve as a useful support for the common use of public spaces does not become, instead, an instrument for the surveillance and harassment of disfavored individuals or groups? Even the Warren Court, which spoke with significant resolve in articulating the procedures to be followed in the investigation of serious crime, was remarkably tentative in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Terry v Ohio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the principal case in which that Court confronted everyday aspects of police patrol: &quot;We approach the issues in this case mindful of the limitations of the judicial function in controlling the myriad daily situations in which policemen and citizens confront each other on the street.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is increasingly apparent, moreover, that answers to the many questions posed today about the appropriate role of police in communities--questions not only about the proper scope of police patrol authority, but also about the best means for assuring police accountability--are likely to emanate not from national judicial pronouncements, but from the accumulated wisdom deriving from local experimentation. And in this regard, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opinions as a whole are perhaps greater than the sum of their parts. These opinions, read together, do not foreclose, but in an important way expand the opportunity for further experimentation with laws regulating public disorder--even as the Court retains for itself a good deal of room to step in and limit this experimentation, if necessary, at some future point. In this sense, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is quite different from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Papachristou v City of Jacksonville</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --that most dramatic of the facial vagueness cases that collectively remade the law applicable to public order in the 1960s and 1970s--even though in both cases the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*145]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court invalidated a public order law.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The unanimous Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Papachristou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> self-confidently, even eagerly, pronounced Jacksonville, Florida's vagrancy ordinance an archaic law that threatened both fundamental rule-of-law values and central tenets of the American constitutional system.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In contrast, the Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> groped anxiously for narrow grounds. Even the Justices in the majority felt constrained to empathize with the efforts of Chicago communities to deal with the serious gang problems afflicting them, to &quot;characterize . . . clearly the narrow scope&quot; of the Court's holding, and most importantly, to suggest alternative means by which Chicago might constitutionally regulate the loitering of gang members.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, even acknowledging a special need for judicial humility in this fluid area, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Court could at least have begun to define a framework within which future experimentation with new forms of police patrol might be assessed. The Court made precious little progress on this more modest front. Indeed, there is a strong case to be made that the majority in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did more harm than good to the project of placing reasonable constraints on police. The Court invalidated Chicago's ordinance on the ground that the ordinance granted too much discretion to police, thus creating an undue risk that it would be arbitrarily employed;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Court's decision, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*146]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  however, may well point localities in the direction of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">expanding</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the scope of police discretion in subsequent legislation. Similarly, the facial vagueness doctrine that was the basis for the decision addresses the concern that imprecise laws delegate basic policy matters to police officers on patrol, thus promoting ad hoc and capricious police enforcement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not encourage localities and their police departments frankly to acknowledge police discretion and to develop means of using it in an accountable way for the positive good of communities. Instead, the decision is more likely to drive discretion underground and to suppress the open discussion of considerations regarding its appropriate exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was arrived at through the highly technical parsing of nine words in Chicago's gang loitering ordinance.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The majority opinion resulting from this exercise is not only unconvincing on its own terms; it is also disturbingly detached from serious consideration of both the nature of police patrol discretion and the efficacy of the Court's attempts to influence its character. Because no law can be entirely precise and because there is &quot;no yardstick of impermissible indeterminacy&quot; to be used in the review of challenged legislation,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vagueness doctrine as employed by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority confers on courts considerable discretion to second-guess the efforts of localities to regulate public conduct in an effort to enhance the common use of public spaces. At the same time, however, the majority's methodology--its narrow focus on the language of Chicago's gang loitering ordinance--deprives judges employing the doctrine of any real ability to promote the positive use of police discretion for a community's good. Thus, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority may foster an illusion of judicial competence in this arena. But the realities of street-level policing remain unchanged and may even have been influenced for the worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article offers an analysis of the Court's situation and a modest proposal for reform. I argue that the Court will make little &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*147]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  progress on the project of constraining arbitrary police enforcement of newly enacted public order laws until it imports some realism into its doctrinal framework. Realism about police patrol discretion, moreover, points in the direction of a vagueness test that is not focused exclusively on the words of this new generation of public order laws. Rather, the Court should consider more broadly whether the exercise of police discretion contemplated in new legislation will take place under conditions that provide reasonable assurances of police accountability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part I briefly describes both the context in which the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ordinance was enacted and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opinions themselves. Part II then delves into the confusion in the Court's vagueness analysis. This part argues that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Court's approach to vagueness does not meaningfully constrain the opportunity for arbitrary police action because it has no application to many contexts in which this opportunity is present--in the enforcement of traffic laws, for instance, or in the area of stop and frisk. Moreover, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority's narrow focus on the language of Chicago's gang loitering ordinance may encourage legislators searching for precise terms to broaden the enforcement authorization given to police and thus to augment, rather than narrow, the scope of police discretion. The majority thus focused on factors of little importance to the restraint of police arbitrariness. It also ignored aspects of the Chicago law that might actually have promoted the judicious use of discretion by Chicago police. Indeed, the majority's disregard of significant innovations in the Chicago ordinance is likely to retard efforts at promoting police accountability. Part III concludes with a sketch of a more realistic vagueness jurisprudence in the area of public order policing.<BR><BR>I. THE CASE AND ITS CONTEXT<BR><BR>A. THE CHICAGO ORDINANCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chicago's gang loitering ordinance was enacted in 1992, during a period when the number of Chicago homicides deemed to be gang related by the Chicago Police Department was in the midst of a fivefold increase--from approximately fifty-one such homicides in 1987 to around 132 in 1991, and then to a high of about &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*148]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  240 in 1994 (a number representing 26.2 percent of all Chicago homicides for that year).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Street gang homicide tends to increase and decrease in spurts, but the huge spurt in the early 1990s broke all previous records in Chicago and dramatically increased the risk of being killed in a street gang-related homicide for, in particular, African-American males and Latinos aged fifteen to nineteen years.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, because Chicago gangs tend to concentrate in particular geographical areas, neither this risk nor any of the other risks associated with gang activity fell uniformly across Chicago's neighborhoods. Indeed, one prominent study of Chicago gangs found that for the three-year period from 1987 to 1990, the rate of street-gang motivated crime in the two most dangerous parts of Chicago was seventy-six times that of the two safest areas.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, even in high-crime neighborhoods (some of which echoed with gunfire almost nightly during this period), gang-related crime &quot;[was] not monolithic, but rather diverse, affecting different neighborhoods in different ways.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In those neighborhoods where competition among rival street gangs for constricted turf was intense, for example, buildings of all sorts were often covered with multiple layers of graffiti; neighborhoods in other parts of Chicago, however, were remarkably free of graffiti even though inundated with gang members simply because a given gang &quot;was so much in command that [it] did not need many physical markers to identify [its] turf.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The potentially most lethal street gang situations in Chicago at this time involved turf-related violence--violence that researchers found to be primarily &quot;expressive&quot; (meaning that it was undertaken principally for purposes like defense and glorification of the gang) rather than &quot;instrumental&quot; (motivated primarily by the desire to acquire money or property from, for &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*149]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  instance, the possession or sale of drugs).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chicago Police Department estimated in 1992 that more than forty major street gangs were active in Chicago.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most violent gangs tended to be those smaller gangs that controlled only a few fiercely defended blocks.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort to enact a gang loitering law in Chicago can be traced to 1991, when a number of Chicago neighborhood groups concerned about the rising violence associated with street gangs began negotiating with city officials to develop anti-gang legislation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These negotiations led to hearings before the Chicago City Council in the spring of 1992 during which testimony was elicited concerning a proposal for enactment of an ordinance regulating loitering by gang members in public places. Many concerned citizens testified poignantly about the disruption that the latest wave of gang violence had worked in their lives. A mother of four, for instance, attested that in her neighborhood, children no longer played hopscotch or jacks in the street: &quot;I wish you could see the rust that has accumulated because they cannot ride [their] bikes.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eighty-eight-year-old Susan Mary Jackson spoke forcefully of the fear she experienced in public spaces: &quot;'We used to have a nice neighborhood. We don't have it anymore. . . . I am scared to go out in the daytime . . . . you can't pass because they are standing. I am afraid to go to the store.'&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> City Council members, however, also heard warnings that loitering ordinances were both unconstitutional and prone to abuse: &quot;Vague laws . . . based on the concept of loitering . . . have historically been subject to massive abuse by law enforcement, both in this city and other cities.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They heard from a representative of the police department who affirmed &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*150]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that a loitering ordinance would be a viable tool for use in dealing with gang problems, but who also cautioned that no ordinance, standing alone, could substitute for a more comprehensive approach to these problems.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed ordinance &quot;drew both support and opposition from Chicago citizens of all backgrounds.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The City Council debate on the ordinance reflected this division and was described by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Chicago Tribune</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as &quot;one of the most heated and emotional council debates in recent memory.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much of the debate centered on the concern that the proposed ordinance would have a disparate impact on racial minorities--a concern that was most passionately expressed by several of the eight African-American aldermen who ultimately voted against the new law.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These alderman charged that the ordinance was &quot;'drafted to protect the downtown area and the white community' at the expense of innocent blacks.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, however, the ordinance received critical support from aldermen representing over a dozen high-crime, predominantly African-American and Latino wards.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alderman Ed Smith, an African American representing a heavily minority district with severe crime problems, was particularly outspoken in his support: &quot;This doesn't allow the police to go hog wild. But we're tired of seeing the rights of gangbangers get protected when . . . a mother can't send her children outside for fear of them getting shot to death in a drive-by shooting.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 18, 1992, the City Council enacted the proposed ordinance by a wide margin of thirty-one &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*151]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to eleven.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of the debate, six of the city's eighteen African-American aldermen voted in favor of the ordinance; as noted previously, eight African-American aldermen voted against the new law.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City Council issued findings based on the evidence presented at the Council hearings that were included in the text of the ordinance to explain the reasons for its enactment. The council found that Chicago was experiencing an increasing murder rate, as well as an increase in violent and drug-related crime, and that both were largely attributable to criminal street gang activity.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The members determined that in many parts of Chicago, street gangs had, in effect, &quot;taken over&quot; entire neighborhoods by intimidating residents into retreating from parks, sidewalks, and other public spaces that the gangs then occupied as their turf. &quot;One of the methods by which criminal street gangs establish control over identifiable areas,&quot; the council found, &quot;is by loitering in those areas and intimidating others from entering. . . .&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The members determined that loitering in such places by gang members created &quot;a justifiable fear for the safety of persons and property in the area because of the violence, drug-dealing and vandalism often associated with such activity.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aggressive action was necessary, the council determined, &quot;to preserve the City's streets and other public places so that the public [might] use such places without fear.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chicago ordinance accordingly authorized police to order any group of two or more people found loitering in public places to move along on pain of arrest, so long as at least one of the group was reasonably believed to be a member of a criminal street gang. The law specifically provided as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whenever a police officer observes a person whom he reasonably believes to be a criminal street gang member loitering in any public place with one or more other persons, he shall &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*152]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area. Any person who does not promptly obey such an order is in violation of this section.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drafted in a manner analogous to that employed in the federal Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Chicago ordinance was replete with prolix definitions of each of its key terms. Thus the ordinance defined a &quot;criminal street gang&quot; to mean any ongoing organization, association in fact, or group of three or more persons having as one of its substantial activities the commission of certain specified crimes (like murder, drug dealing, and armed violence), and whose members individually or collectively were engaged in or had engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Criminal gang activity&quot; was further defined to mean the commission, attempted commission, or solicitation of a lengthy list of offenses &quot;by two or more persons, or by an individual at the direction of, or in association with, any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A &quot;pattern&quot; of such activity simply denoted two or more acts of criminal gang activity, provided that at least two of these acts must have been committed within five years of each other and at least one such act must have occurred after the effective date of the ordinance.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Loitering&quot; was also a defined term in the Chicago ordinance. It referred to &quot;remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Notably, the law was drafted so that gang members and those loitering with them did not violate the ordinance simply by loitering together, but only by thereafter defying a police order &quot;to disperse and remove themselves from the area.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ordinance further provided as an affirmative defense &quot;that no person who was observed loitering was in fact a member of a criminal street gang.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Violations of the law were punishable by a fine of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*153]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  up to $ 500, imprisonment for not more than six months, and the requirement to perform up to 120 hours of community service.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within two months of the ordinance's enactment, the Chicago Police Department promulgated General Order 92-4, a police regulation which set forth specific guidelines to govern enforcement of the new law for the purpose of ensuring that the ordinance was not enforced in an arbitrary or discriminatory way.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The order required each police district and each area unit of the department's Gang Crime Section to maintain a file for the purpose of identifying those groups and individuals active in a given district who constituted &quot;criminal street gangs&quot; and &quot;criminal street gang members&quot; as defined in the ordinance.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Identification of a gang as a criminal street gang was to be based on factors like the analysis of crime pattern data, interviews with gang members or witnesses, and information from reliable informants.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The order specified that dispersal orders should issue only on probable cause to believe that criminal street gang members were loitering with each other or with other people in a given area. Probable cause of a person's membership in a criminal street gang, the order stated, might be established by evidence such as the individual's admission of membership, his use of signals distinctive of a specific gang, or the wearing of emblems, tattoos, or similar markings that could not reasonably be expected to be displayed by anyone except a member of a particular gang.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The order specifically cautioned that gang membership could not be established solely on the basis of clothing worn by the individual but available for sale to the general public.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On its face, Chicago's gang loitering ordinance applied citywide. In practice, the Chicago Police Department limited its application in General Order 92-4 to public places designated by the department as areas in which the presence of gang members had resulted in &quot;a demonstrable effect on the activities of law abiding persons in the surrounding community.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Examples of areas appropriate &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*154]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for such designation, according to police, included &quot;locations near schools used for criminal street gang recruiting&quot; or &quot;locations near businesses where criminal street gang activity [has] adversely affected the patronage of those businesses.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Designations were to be made by district commanders based on consultations with relevant police personnel, local officials, leaders of community organizations, and other citizens able to provide reliable information.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, General Order 92-4 specified that only specially designated police personnel--like members of the Gang Crime section or the district tactical units--could arrest individuals for violating the gang loitering law.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These police officers were required to familiarize themselves with the information maintained by the department concerning criminal street gangs active in the areas in which the officers worked.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officers making arrests pursuant to the gang loitering law were also required to prepare written reports which, among other things, fully described the circumstances giving rise to probable cause to arrest.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n61</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chicago Police Department began enforcing the new law in August 1992 and stopped enforcing it in December 1995, when it was held invalid by an Illinois appellate court.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During that time, the police issued over 89,000 dispersal orders and arrested over 42,000 people for violating the ordinance.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Enforcement was &quot;overwhelmingly concentrated on the City's high-crime neighborhoods.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the ordinance was first enacted, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley (one of the law's ardent supporters) had sarcastically offered that &quot;the Police Department might not enforce the new law in the wards of those aldermen who voted against it. . . .&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No City &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*155]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Council member attempted to take the mayor up on this proposal during the three years that the law was enforced. In fact, there is little evidence that support for the ordinance among City Council members in any way diminished once the ordinance had actually been employed. In May 1998, the City Council passed a resolution urging the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold the ordinance. The resolution passed by a vote of twenty-five to eight--and now, incidentally, with the support of a majority of those voting aldermen representing predominantly African-American wards.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gang loitering law fared considerably less well in the courts. At the trial level, three judges of the Circuit Court of Cook County upheld the ordinance (and one judge held it constitutional as applied to people whom the police reasonably believed to be gang members), but twelve judges, in separate cases, declared the ordinance invalid on its face.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Appellate Court of Illinois concluded that the ordinance impermissibly impaired the freedom of assembly of non-gang members in violation of the First Amendment, that it was unconstitutionally vague, that it infringed upon Fourth Amendment rights, and that it improperly criminalized status rather than conduct.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Supreme Court of Illinois held that the gang loitering law violated due process because it was &quot;impermissibly vague on its face and an arbitrary restriction on personal liberties.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the Illinois Supreme Court's judgment on the ground that Chicago's gang loitering ordinance was void for vagueness in that the ordinance failed to set sufficiently specific limitations on the enforcement discretion of Chicago police.<BR><BR>B. THE MORALES OPINIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The holding</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The void-for-vagueness doctrine is one of several devices by which judges may avoid making difficult constitutional &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*156]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  decisions while deciding the controversy before them--in the case of the vagueness doctrine, by invalidating a constitutionally suspect law as overly vague while leaving open the possibility that a clearer version of the law might be upheld.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Sunstein has shown that the current Supreme Court has a special fondness for such devices: that this Court not infrequently employs doctrines like void-for-vagueness to &quot;avoid[] clear rules and final resolutions&quot; and to &quot;allow[] continued space for democratic reflection from Congress and the states.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He terms this style of decision making by courts &quot;judicial minimalism.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Knowing that there is much that it does not know&quot; and &quot;intensely aware of its own limitations,&quot; a minimalist court seeks &quot;to decide cases on narrow grounds.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And this Supreme Court, according to Professor Sunstein, &quot;embraces minimalism.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court's holding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be termed an exercise in judicial minimalism. Indeed, even by minimalist standards, the majority's holding would have to be characterized as unusually narrow. Traditionally, penal laws are said to be unconstitutionally vague when they fail to &quot;define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited&quot; and to establish guidelines for enforcement that are sufficiently concrete so as not to &quot;encourage arbitrary and discriminatory [law] enforcement.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority found that Chicago's gang loitering ordinance failed to satisfy the second of these two requirements.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six Justices concluded that the ordinance's definition of loitering (&quot;to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose&quot;) was so vague that it in effect entrusted police with lawmaking authority and thus created a grave risk of capricious enforcement decisions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority's vagueness holding was thus limited to one aspect of the vagueness doctrine--the role of that doctrine in demanding &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*157]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that enforcement discretion be appropriately constrained--and to a single phrase in Chicago's lengthy and complex loitering law. Justice Stevens's analysis for the majority, moreover, was nothing if not succinct. In deciding that the ordinance's loitering definition was impermissibly vague, the majority proceeded on the assumption that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">every</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> person loitering in a public place manifests some purpose--if only the purpose to loiter. Police charged with dispersing gang members and their associates loitering &quot;with no apparent purpose,&quot; then, were in effect tasked with choosing among the purposes manifested by these individuals--purposes which police could legitimate by acquiescing in the behavior or condemn through orders to disperse. In the Court's words:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumably an officer would have discretion to treat some purposes--perhaps a purpose to engage in idle conversation or simply to enjoy a cool breeze on a warm evening--as too frivolous to be apparent if he suspected a different ulterior motive. Moreover, an officer conscious of the city council's reasons for enacting the ordinance might well ignore its text and issue a dispersal order, even though an illicit purpose [was] actually apparent.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority professed to be bound by the Illinois Supreme Court's conclusion that the Chicago ordinance's loitering definition clothed officers with &quot;'absolute discretion . . . to determine what activities constitute loitering.'&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even setting aside any deference to this statement as a construction of local law, however, the majority found &quot;the 'no apparent purpose' standard&quot; to be &quot;inherently subjective.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And such a subjective standard, in the majority's view, impermissibly left lawmaking &quot;'to the moment-to-moment judgment of the policeman on his beat.'&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Other issues</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The majority's holding, then, was decidedly limited. But Justice Stevens addressed several additional issues in those portions of his opinion joined only by Justices Souter and Ginsburg. First, he elaborated on the vagueness doctrine's &quot;fair notice&quot; requirement and its application to the Chicago ordinance. In the view of the plurality, the gang loitering law also violated the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*158]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vagueness prohibition by leaving the public uncertain as to the nature of the conduct the law prohibited:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to imagine how any citizen of the city of Chicago standing in a public place with a group of people would know if he or she had an &quot;apparent purpose.&quot; If she were talking to another person, would she have an apparent purpose? If she were frequently checking her watch and looking expectantly down the street, would she have an apparent purpose?  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plurality rejected the argument that police dispersal orders could serve to inform citizens of the nature of the prohibited conduct for two reasons. First, the plurality concluded that Chicago's citizens were entitled to advance notice regarding the loitering prohibited by the ordinance so that these citizens might avoid ever being ordered to disperse.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, the Justices in the plurality agreed that the dispersal orders contemplated in the new law (requiring gang members and their associates &quot;to disperse and remove themselves from the area&quot;) had the effect of compounding the inadequacy of the notice afforded by the ordinance's definition of loitering.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Justice Stevens's words, &quot;After such an order issues, how long must the loiterers remain apart? How far must they move? If each loiterer walks around the block and they meet again at the same location, are they subject to arrest or merely to being ordered to disperse again?&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plurality also explicitly addressed the issue whether loitering is a constitutionally protected activity and determined that the freedom to loiter for innocent purposes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">is</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an attribute of personal liberty protected by the Due Process Clause: &quot;Indeed, it is apparent that an individual's decision to remain in a public place of his choice is as much a part of his liberty as the freedom of movement inside frontiers that is 'a part of our heritage.'&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Notably, however, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*159]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Justice Stevens did not analyze whether the impact of Chicago's gang loitering ordinance on this liberty interest would itself support a facial challenge to the ordinance: &quot;There is no need . . . to decide whether the impact of the Chicago ordinance on constitutionally protected liberty alone would suffice to support a facial challenge under the overbreadth doctrine. For it is clear that the vagueness of this enactment makes a facial challenge appropriate.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justices O'Connor, Breyer, and Kennedy--the other three Justices in the majority--did not join in those portions of the Stevens opinion dealing with the notice issue,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nor did they address the issue whether loitering for innocent purposes is an activity protected by the Due Process Clause. Each wrote separately. In the most significant of these opinions concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, Justice O'Connor, joined by Justice Breyer, went to some lengths to explain that despite the invalidation of Chicago's gang loitering law, &quot;there remain open to Chicago reasonable alternatives to combat the very real threat posed by gang intimidation and violence.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She underscored the majority's conclusion that an ordinance limited to loitering by gang members that had &quot;an apparently harmful purpose&quot; would no doubt satisfy the vagueness prohibition.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, too, she said, would a loitering ordinance that restricted its criminal penalties to gang members or that defined loitering to mean &quot;'remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose other than to establish control over identifiable areas, to intimidate others from entering those areas, or to conceal illegal activities.'&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Laws incorporating limits on the area and manner in which they might be enforced, she suggested, should also be distinguished from Chicago's gang loitering law.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The dissents</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Justice Scalia dissented in a separate opinion, as &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*160]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  did Justice Thomas, in an opinion joined by both Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia. Justice Scalia's dissent began by questioning whether federal courts even have the power to declare laws void in all their applications rather than as applied.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Acknowledging that the Court has exercised such a power &quot;for some of the present century,&quot; he next argued that except in free-speech cases subject to the overbreadth doctrine, the Court should at least confine this power to those cases where a law is unconstitutional in all its applications.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Scalia relied heavily on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">United States v Salerno</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in which the Court purported to disfavor facial challenges and noted that they are &quot;the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite Justice Scalia's impassioned treatment of this issue, however, the majority in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not address the rationale for entertaining a facial challenge to Chicago's ordinance, while the plurality expressly declined to &quot;resolve the viability of [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Salerno's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] dictum.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plurality asserted simply that when vagueness permeates a law like Chicago's gang loitering ordinance--a criminal law that the plurality characterized as containing no mens rea requirement and infringing on constitutionally protected rights--a facial attack should be entertained: &quot;Since we, like the Illinois Supreme Court, conclude that vagueness permeates the ordinance, a facial challenge is appropriate.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*161]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not surprisingly, both Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas strongly disagreed with the characterization of Chicago's gang loitering ordinance as vague. Justice Scalia argued that even if the appropriate circumstances for a facial challenge extend more broadly than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Salerno</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would suggest, Chicago's gang loitering law would still pass muster because the law is not vague &quot;in most or even a substantial number of applications.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He took issue with the notion that loiterers are always manifesting some apparent purpose for remaining in any one place and argued, instead, that loiterers often display no apparent purpose for their behavior for the simple reason that they have no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">actual</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> purpose in so behaving: &quot;Remaining at rest will be a person's normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Scalia concluded that in the bulk of cases, Chicago police could easily perceive the difference between those remaining in a place for an apparent reason and those remaining there without such a reason: &quot;The criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the Chicago Ordinance could hardly be clearer.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Thomas's dissent was (if possible) even more emphatic: &quot;The Court's conclusion that the ordinance is impermissibly vague because it &quot;'necessarily entrusts law-making to the moment-to-moment judgment of the policeman on his beat,'&quot; cannot be reconciled with common sense, longstanding police practice, or this Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the plurality, the dissenters similarly rejected the argument that a law hinging arrest on the refusal to obey a clear and explicit police order might nevertheless provide inadequate &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*162]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  notice to the citizen as to the nature of the prohibited conduct: in Justice Thomas's words, &quot;there is nothing 'vague' about an order to disperse.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Scalia chided the plurality for perceiving vagueness problems in police orders &quot;to disperse and remove . . . from the area.&quot; He noted that this analysis, if adopted by the Court, &quot;would render unconstitutional for vagueness many . . . Presidential proclamations,&quot; including President Eisen-hower's command that all persons obstructing the court-ordered enrollment of black students in the Little Rock, Arkansas public schools &quot;'cease and desist therefrom, and . . . disperse forthwith.'&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dissenters also cited a lengthy history in which loitering has been criminalized to argue that loitering is not a fundamental right &quot;'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,'&quot; and thus properly characterized as a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the plurality's insistence on a &quot;Fundamental Freedom to Loiter,&quot; Justice Scalia noted, &quot;there is not the slightest evidence for the existence of [such] a genuine constitutional right. . . .&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Thomas's dissent also detailed at some length the human costs exacted in many cities by the presence of criminal street gangs. &quot;Gangs fill the daily lives of many of our poorest and most vulnerable citizens with a terror [to which] the Court does not give sufficient consideration,&quot; he said.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He noted that in 1998, &quot;in an effort to curb plummeting attendance, the Chicago Public Schools hired dozens of adults to escort children to school&quot;--children &quot;too terrified of gang violence to leave their homes alone.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Thomas quoted the testimony of one Chicago resident before the City Council to the effect that &quot;'only about maybe one or two percent of the people in the city [are] causing these problems maybe, but it's keeping 98 percent of us in our houses and off the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*163]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  streets and afraid to shop.'&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a ringing conclusion to his dissent, Justice Thomas noted that &quot;the Court focuses extensively on the 'rights' of gang members and their companions. It can safely do so--the people who will have to live with the consequences of today's opinion do not live in our neighborhoods.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He charged that the Court, by focusing exclusively on the 2 percent, had &quot;denied our most vulnerable citizens the very thing that Justice Stevens elevates above all else--the 'freedom of movement.'&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. SOME CLARITY ABOUT VAGUENESS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opinions explicitly raise numerous significant issues and implicitly touch upon even more. It is with the Court's vagueness analysis, however, that one must begin in assessing the failure of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority to illuminate significant current issues regarding police patrol. The problems in this analysis are not apparent from a superficial reading of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opinions. Such a reading discloses that the Court has reached no agreement as to those circumstances in which the facial vagueness doctrine should apply. This, however, is nothing new.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such a reading demonstrates, as well, that the Justices vehemently disagree among themselves as to whether the &quot;apparent purpose&quot; language in Chicago's gang loitering ordinance is even vague. This fact alone does not constitute an indictment of their work. As Justice Frankfurter noted many years ago, unconstitutional indefiniteness &quot;is itself an indefinite concept.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the recent revival of statutes and ordinances aimed at improving the quality of life in public places, it is &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*164]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not altogether surprising that the Justices might come to different conclusions about whether any one of these newly enacted laws is sufficiently precise so as to reasonably confine the opportunity for abusive enforcement by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking no further than the four corners of the void-for-vagueness doctrine as it has been traditionally understood, then, it is possible to cast the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opinions as instances of reasonable disagreement among the Justices within a framework of overall doctrinal coherence. On closer inspection, however, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> evinces a deeper problem--a real inability on the part of the majority to offer even a facially plausible account of the role that the vagueness doctrine actually plays in constraining the opportunity for arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement by local police. To bring this aspect of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the surface, I first explore the degree to which the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> holding is in tension with other aspects of the legal environment in which public order policing occurs--and in ways that deprive the majority of the ability credibly to maintain that this holding represents a significant constraint on the opportunity for abusive police enforcement. I then argue that the majority focused its attention on matters of little relevance to the constraint of police discretion and ignored aspects of the Chicago law that could have promoted the judicious use of discretion by officers on patrol. Overall, this part contends that the majority's inability to articulate a workable framework for its vagueness doctrine threatens to deprive communities of the ability to enact legitimate laws that might assist in the amelioration of pressing social problems--and in what amounts to an illusory effort to constrain police.<BR><BR>A. THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT FOR PUBLIC ORDER POLICING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judicial invalidation of local public order laws as facially vague transformed the legal regime governing public order that was in place in this country into the 1960s and 1970s--a legal regime characterized by loitering, disorderly conduct, and vagrancy laws that were so vague in terminology and so broad in scope that they had the effect, in practice, of &quot;'legally' authorizing the police to arrest virtually anyone.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vagueness &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*165]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cases from this period, though formally concerned that laws be sufficiently clear both to inform people what conduct is prohibited and to confine the discretion of enforcement authorities, were in fact animated most strongly by the latter concern--that laws should provide adequate guidelines for enforcement so as to limit the opportunity for the arbitrary and discriminatory application of legal prohibitions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the time </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Kolender v Lawson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was decided in 1982, it was explicitly settled that the most important aspect of the vagueness doctrine is its role in requiring that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was also settled (albeit implicitly) that the facial vagueness doctrine has a special application to local public order laws directed at various forms of public nuisance.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the period leading up to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Kolender</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the exercise of police discretion pursuant to such laws was increasingly seen to evade any meaningful review in the criminal courts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decisions facially invalidating public order offenses as void for vagueness, then, were designed in large part to help secure a simple principle--that individuals should not walk public streets, as the Court said, &quot;'only at the whim of . . . police officers.'&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, then, is but the latest in a line of Supreme Court cases in which the Court has employed the facial vagueness prohibition supposedly to constrain the potential for harsh and arbitrary law enforcement by local police. The assumption in all these cases--an assumption expressed quite clearly in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">--is that courts &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*166]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  significantly contribute to the reasonable restraint of capricious police enforcement when they facially invalidate those public order ordinances that afford &quot;too much discretion to the police.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This assumption regarding the street-level efficacy of the facial vagueness doctrine seemed eminently plausible in the 1960s and 1970s, given both the panoply of broad and ill-defined public order laws to be found in the legal codes of many municipalities and the relative lack of empirical knowledge about the nature of police discretion.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because police today are (and are understood to be) vested with a considerable degree of discretion that is beyond the scope of traditional vagueness doctrine, however, this assumption is significantly less plausible as applied to recently enacted laws like the one at stake in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This point can be most easily established by focusing on three characteristics of the current legal regime that, together, create substantial opportunities for police arbitrariness that do not raise traditional vagueness concerns. First is the significant potential for abusive enforcement that exists pursuant to broad but clear laws--such as the juvenile curfews that have become increasingly popular over the last ten years.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most aggressive employment of the facial vagueness doctrine does not constrain the opportunity for police misuse of such laws and, indeed, may even encourage municipalities to enact them. Next, the prevalence in certain domains of numerous narrow and specific, but commonly violated, low-level statutes and ordinances likewise creates opportunities for abusive police enforcement. These opportunities, too, lie beyond the scope of traditional vagueness doctrine and thus challenge the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority's assumption that the void-for-vagueness doctrine represents a meaningful check on police. Finally, the Court's own Fourth Amendment jurisprudence--its endorsement of warrantless police actions premised on admittedly nebulous concepts like probable cause--vests police with a significant degree of street-level discretion that is hard to reconcile with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*167]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  majority's condemnation of the discretion involved in applying Chicago's gang loitering ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Broad, clear laws and the vagueness prohibition</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. A brief hypothetical can demonstrate not only that traditional vagueness doctrine fails to address the opportunity for abusive police enforcement created by broad but clear laws, but that vagueness doctrine may even encourage legislators to expand the reach of legal prohibitions. Consider the finding of the Chicago City Council that in many Chicago neighborhoods in 1992, criminal street gangs loitered in identifiable areas so as to establish control over these areas &quot;and intimidate others from entering&quot; them.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Based on this finding, a council member in 1992 might well have proposed an ordinance authorizing police to order any person reasonably believed to be a gang member to depart from any neighborhood in which he might be found loitering so as to intimidate others from using public spaces. This formulation was essentially endorsed in Justice Stevens's opinion for the majority in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, even as the Court invalidated Chicago's gang loitering ordinance on the ground that the &quot;no apparent purpose&quot; language in that law's loitering definition was unconstitutionally vague, the Court reached out to opine that an ordinance limited to loitering by gang members that &quot;had an apparently harmful . . . effect&quot; would &quot;no doubt be sufficient&quot; to satisfy vagueness concerns.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But could our council member in 1992 have been reasonably confident that such a law would survive facial vagueness review? In an opinion offering only the most summary analysis, the Supreme Court in 1971 facially invalidated a law prohibiting three or more people from assembling on any sidewalk and conducting themselves in a manner annoying to passersby, noting that a city may not enact and enforce an ordinance &quot;whose violation may entirely depend upon whether or not a policeman is annoyed.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our hypothetical legislator, then, would have needed to address the question whether an ordinance authorizing police to move &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*168]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  along loiterers who are acting so as to intimidate others is any less vague than an ordinance directed at conduct that annoys. Even prior to the majority's dicta in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a court might have answered this question in the affirmative. But this answer was certainly not clear-cut in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what would our legislator have done next? He might have suggested a law prohibiting those reasonably believed to be criminal street gang members from loitering in public places with the specific intent of intimidating others from entering these places. He might have pointed out that the Court has on occasion suggested that a specific intent requirement ameliorates vagueness concerns.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But on further consideration, he would probably have concluded that even this revision was inadequate to ensure the constitutionality of the legislation he intended to propose. The Supreme Court's observations about specific intent have not prevented several state supreme courts from invalidating public order laws reasonably read to include such an element as void for vagueness.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such invalidations, moreover, may in fact make sense--at least to the extent that the vagueness doctrine's chief concern is the potential for arbitrary police enforcement. The specific intent element has traditionally been said to address the vagueness doctrine's mandate that penal laws provide adequate notice to the public about the nature of prohibited conduct--not its concern that police might misuse an overly ambiguous law.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is easy to understand, moreover, how including a specific intent element among those facts which must be shown at trial works (at least in theory) to cure notice difficulties. As the Court has said, to hold someone liable for violating a law containing a specific intent element, a fact finder must conclude that the defendant at the time of the alleged offense &quot;[was] aware that what he [did was] precisely that which the statute forbids.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such a conclusion, of course, substantially &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*169]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ameliorates any concern that because of the vagueness in a legal prohibition, the defendant had no notice of what the law required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is less easy to perceive, however, how a specific intent requirement meaningfully constrains the potential for arbitrary police enforcement on the street. In this context, the vagueness doctrine's demand for adequate specificity in statutes and ordinances is designed to ensure that officers do not capriciously employ ambiguous laws to charge people in light of the officers' own &quot;personal predilections.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But our conscientious legislator in 1992 was already worried about the vagueness in a law authorizing police to disperse those gang members loitering in such a way as to intimidate others, objectively speaking. Could he honestly conclude that police receive significantly more guidance from a law directing them to move along those gang members loitering so as to intimidate others--but now from each gang member's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">subjective</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> perspective? In reality, an officer would rely on the very same observable conduct to make judgments about the loiterer's internal mental state that he would have used to determine whether this loiterer was acting in a manner reasonably likely to have harmful effects on others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our legislator could not be blamed at this juncture for taking yet another tack to minimize any vagueness in his proposed ordinance. He might have noticed that most street gang offenses in Chicago have historically been committed by young people between the ages of fifteen and nineteen.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why not enact a law prohibiting at least the juveniles in this group from loitering in public places? Or better yet, from being in public places, except for carefully specified purposes? By removing from police the necessity of distinguishing intimidating or purposefully harmful loitering from harmless loitering, this approach does substantially ameliorate vagueness concerns. But it does so only by broadening the category of people subject to the law to a group defined by age--an attribute offering the advantage that it can be specified (at least comparatively) with a substantial measure of rulelike precision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not what happened in Chicago in 1992. There is evidence, however, that something very much like this hypothetical &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*170]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  happened in many other municipalities in the 1990s. In cities across the country, many legislators concerned with public order issues proposed and then enacted laws very similar to the one just discussed--namely, juvenile curfews.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These legislators, moreover, were not out of the mainstream in any sense. In the 1990s, curfews became &quot;the norm in major American cities.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As of 1995, they existed in 77 percent of those cities with 1992 populations of 200,000 or more; half of all such cities either enacted new curfews or revised existing ones between the years 1990 and 1994.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curfews have also been upheld by several appellate courts. Indeed, within one week of the Court's decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> invalidating Chicago's gang loitering law, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in an en banc decision, upheld the constitutionality of the District of Columbia's juvenile curfew--a law &quot;which bars juveniles 16 and under from being in a public place unaccompanied by a parent or without equivalent adult supervision from 11:00 p.m. on Sunday through Thursday to 6:00 a.m. the following day&quot; and from midnight on Friday and Saturday night to 6:00 a.m. the following morning.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The law was enacted &quot;to protect the welfare of minors by reducing the likelihood that minors will perpetrate or become victims of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*171]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  crime. . . .&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n136</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, the Fourth Circuit easily rejected a vagueness challenge to Charlottesville, Virginia's juvenile curfew, noting that the search for clarity in a criminal code &quot;can be a receding mirage&quot; which cannot be permitted to &quot;'convert into a constitutional dilemma the practical difficulties in drawing [appropriate] criminal statutes. . . .'&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n137</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juvenile curfews have both supporters and detractors.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n138</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But whatever their merits, it is perverse that vagueness decisions supposedly emanating from a concern with the potential for arbitrary police enforcement may well have tilted localities in the direction of enacting curfews as opposed to gang loitering, disorderly conduct, or other similar public order laws. Curfews may or may not be a better way of reducing crime and improving the quality of life in public spaces, but there is little to suggest that curfews are preferable from the standpoint of limiting the opportunity for arbitrary and discriminatory police enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least within the hours of their operation, curfews have the practical effect of authorizing police to approach and detain </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">any</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> person who appears young enough to trigger their prohibitions. This is an extremely broad category of people--and incidentally, the very category of people who are already among the most likely to be approached by police in a public place.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n139</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Curfews, moreover, are often enacted as &quot;quick-fix&quot; solutions to concerns about community violence--and without any consideration of the police resources needed to enforce them evenhandedly.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n140</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such laws may not be vague, but the manner in which they are (or are not) employed &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*172]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  can in practice still subject a large number of people to spotty, erratic--and even arbitrary--enforcement efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this escapes traditional vagueness analysis. In evaluating whether a given law is impermissibly vague, courts do not routinely consider the alternatives to this law. They never consider that the overall effect of a body of decisions invalidating laws in a given subject area as overly vague may be paradoxical: that in future efforts to avoid vagueness and imprecision in defining a law's core concepts (like any ordinance addressed to &quot;gang members&quot; who adopt &quot;turf&quot; and &quot;annoy,&quot; &quot;harass,&quot; or &quot;intimidate&quot; others), legislators searching for precise terms may end up broadening the enforcement authorization given to police and thus adding to, rather than narrowing, the scope of enforcement discretion. The potential correlation between breadth and clarity in public order legislation, however, creates serious analytic difficulties for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority's assumption that traditional vagueness doctrine can be meaningfully employed to limit the potential for arbitrary exercises of police patrol discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Vagueness and the prevalence of frequently violated rules</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Vagueness doctrine is concerned with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">potential</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for arbitrary enforcement posed by a given law. No one in the least familiar with current controversies involving police, however, can be unaware of the principal arena in which police today have been charged with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">actual</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arbitrariness and discrimination in enforcement--namely, traffic stops. The Justice Department and New Jersey officials, for instance, are even now in the process of implementing a consent decree that mandates changes in the operation of the New Jersey State Police to address long-standing charges of racial discrimination against minority motorists by personnel within this law enforcement agency--charges, parenthetically, that the governor of New Jersey has conceded to be true.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n141</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The admittedly small number of empirical studies on this subject, moreover, together with a much more substantial body of anecdotal evidence, strongly indicate that the problem of racial discrimination in traffic enforcement extends well beyond New Jersey. It is clear that minority &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*173]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  motorists around the country &quot;are pulled over far more frequently than whites.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n142</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African Americans, in particular, &quot;almost universally describe[] . . . as an everyday reality . . . the familiar roadside detention for 'Driving While Black.'&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n143</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grievances of minority motorists stopped by police represent an important challenge for law enforcement officials dedicated to overcoming the estrangement that has not infrequently characterized the relationship between police and minority communities. For our purposes here, however, the immediate significance of these grievances lies in the light they shed on the limited ability of the Court materially to influence the opportunity for arbitrariness in police enforcement through the invalidation of vague laws. Traffic rules regulating speed, lane changing, and the like are among the most precise regulations to be found in state and local legal codes. These laws, by traditional standards, are simply not vague. Despite the specificity of such laws, however, no one could deny that the opportunity for their arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is huge--whatever one believes about the frequency with which police actually engage in the capricious exercise of enforcement authority. Low-level traffic offenses (like most laws regulating minor misconduct) are not invariably enforced, even when the evidence of their violation is clear. Because almost everyone violates traffic rules sometimes, moreover, the police, &quot;if they are patient, can eventually pull over anyone they are interested in questioning . . . .&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n144</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In effect, clear and precise traffic laws empower police to pursue their own predilections in targeting people for enforcement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">in precisely the manner condemned by the vagueness prohibition</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this point is obscured in traditional vagueness analysis. Lower courts do not routinely consider the claim that in fields of human endeavor that are heavily and minutely regulated with rules that are invariably broken at least part of the time, the judiciary's demand for specificity does not significantly reduce the opportunity for arbitrary law enforcement. Nor has the Supreme Court &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*174]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ever accepted the argument that the Due Process Clause's demand for reasonable specificity in statutes and ordinances might also require that enforcement policies be adequately precise.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n145</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Court's continued skepticism with regard to such an argument, moreover, can probably be safely inferred from its recent unanimous decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Whren v United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n146</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There, the Court outright rejected the claim that the Fourth Amendment might impose obligations on police to adhere to reasonably well-specified enforcement policies (above and beyond that Amendment's mandate that probable cause exist to support arrest) merely because of the abundance of commonly violated regulations within a given sphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c15">Whren</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was, in fact, a &quot;traffic&quot; case. The incident giving rise to the suppression motion in that case began when plainclothes vicesquad officers in the District of Columbia who were patrolling a &quot;high drug area&quot; in an unmarked vehicle observed a dark Pathfinder truck stopped at an intersection.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n147</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their suspicions somewhat aroused by the behavior of the truck's youthful occupants, the officers observed the Pathfinder turn without signaling and then proceed at an &quot;unreasonable&quot; speed. They stopped the truck--apparently in violation of local police regulations permitting plain-clothes officers in unmarked cars to enforce traffic laws only in the case of violations so grave as to pose an immediate threat to the safety of others.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n148</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An officer testified that he approached the Pathfinder to give the driver a warning about traffic violations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n149</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Drawing up to the driver's window, however, he observed plastic bags of crack cocaine in the hands of the passenger, Whren. Both Whren and Brown, the driver of the Pathfinder, were arrested, and quantities of several types of illegal drugs were retrieved from the truck.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n150</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioners in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Whren</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had a simple argument. They contended that probable cause that a driver has violated a civil traffic &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*175]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  regulation should not without more be adequate to justify a traffic stop for the very reason that &quot;. . . a police officer will almost invariably be able to catch any given motorist in [some] technical violation.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n151</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To guard against racially discriminatory traffic stops, as well as the pretextual use of traffic regulations as a tool for investigating other law violations, the petitioners contended that courts judging the reasonableness of a traffic stop for Fourth Amendment purposes should ask &quot;whether the officer's conduct deviated materially from usual police practices, so that a reasonable officer in the same circumstances would not have made the stop for the reasons given . . . .&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n152</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Court emphatically--and unanimously--rejected this argument:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are aware of no principle that would allow us to decide at what point a code of law becomes so expansive and so commonly violated that infraction itself can no longer be the ordinary measure of the lawfulness of enforcement. And even if we could identify such exorbitant codes, we do not know by what standard (or what right) we would decide, as petitioners would have us do, what particular provisions are sufficiently important to merit enforcement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n153</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider the ramifications of this result. There is no question that police employ the maze of traffic regulations proactively to investigate or to prevent other law violations. Indeed, in many cities plagued by things like &quot;gang activity, illegal guns . . . and drive-by shootings,&quot; police officials have observed that &quot;saturating an area with traffic patrol shuts down these illegal operations.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n154</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The phenomenon of enforcing commonly violated, low-level regulations to pursue broader law enforcement goals, moreover, is not limited to traffic enforcement. In New York City, for example, police enforcing precise but often violated laws regulating public drinking, littering, and the like have admitted that one purpose in stepping up enforcement in such areas is to remove weapons from the street.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n155</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police managers there have even claimed that such &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*176]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  enforcement serves generally to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">deter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> weapons possession in public places. In the words of one New York City police administrator, the vigorous enforcement of low-level offenses is important precisely because it makes people leave their guns at home, &quot;knowing they might get stopped.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n156</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aggressive enforcement of low-level offenses to serve broader law enforcement goals may be broadly supported in a community. It may, in fact, help to address more serious crime. The experiences of many minority motorists, however, attest that police do not always exercise discretion in this area with wisdom--or sometimes with any sensitivity to the communities they serve. Even more important for our purposes, moreover, is the undeniable fact that it is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who make these important discretionary judgments concerning the resources to be put into the enforcement of low-level offenses and the broader goals to which this enforcement should be directed. The vagueness prohibition has never been interpreted to constrain the exercise of such discretion--despite the fact that the opportunity for police arbitrariness in this context is at least as significant as the opportunity created by ordinances like Chicago's gang loitering law.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n157</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The Fourth Amendment and the vagueness principle</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Finally, the Court has repeatedly held that it is consistent with the Fourth Amendment for officers on the street, without prior judicial authorization, to apply concepts like &quot;probable cause&quot; and &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; even as the Court has acknowledged that it is impossible to articulate &quot;precisely what [these concepts] mean.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n158</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tolerance shown in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Whren</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to affording police even extremely &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*177]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  broad street-level discretion, then, is not limited to the exceptional Fourth Amendment case. Indeed, the Court has broadly endorsed the notion in its Fourth Amendment jurisprudence that officers can fairly employ &quot;commonsense, nontechnical conceptions&quot; to deal with the practical realities of street patrol.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n159</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This idea exists in considerable tension, however, with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority's assumption that a substantial degree of technical clarity in the language to be applied by patrol officers is necessary to the effective constraint of police discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few examples can illustrate this point. First, the bulk of felony arrests in this country take place pursuant to the conclusion of an officer that probable cause exists to believe that a crime has been committed by the person being arrested. Such arrests generally do not require prior judicial authorization, nor is such authorization sought in most circumstances.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n160</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, officers may in most cases search automobiles and containers within automobiles based on a street-level assessment that probable cause supports the search.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n161</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They may enter homes to pursue fleeing suspects or to seize evidence in the process of being destroyed--again without a warrant, and based on their on-the-scene determinations regarding the existence of probable cause.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n162</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All these activities have been held to be reasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes despite the Court's acknowledgment that probable cause itself--the central concept that police must accurately employ to act within Fourth Amendment constraints--is a &quot;fluid&quot; legal construct &quot;not readily . . . reduced to a neat set of legal rules.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n163</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c15">Terry v Ohio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, however, may be the Court's single most important Fourth Amendment case in terms of its role in constituting a legal environment broadly supportive of the street-level discretion of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*178]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  officers on patrol.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n164</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police acting under the authority of the Court's decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Terry</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and subsequent cases may generally detain people based on reasonable suspicion to believe that these people may be committing or about to commit a crime.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n165</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Individuals may be frisked when there is reasonable suspicion to believe they may be armed and dangerous.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n166</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once again, these detentions and frisks take place without prior judicial authorization. In the great majority of cases, moreover, there is no subsequent judicial review of the officer's judgment about the propriety of his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one could deny that patrol officers employ significant street-level discretion in this context, nor that the proper exercise of this discretion is of tremendous importance both to communities and to police. Indiscriminate street stops and searches, after all, were blamed by the Kerner Commission for helping to foster the &quot;deep hostility between police and ghetto communities&quot; that contributed to numerous tragic riots between 1964 and 1968.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n167</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And even when properly employed, aggressive use of stop and frisk can alienate and estrange communities in ways that ultimately detract from, rather than contribute to, the maintenance of a vibrant civil order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these considerations have not led the Court to attempt more stringently to regulate the area of stop and frisk. The Court has found both street detentions and frisks based on reasonable suspicion to be consistent with Fourth Amendment principles despite its recognition that such encounters are not trivial, but are often &quot;annoying,&quot; &quot;frightening,&quot; and even &quot;humiliating&quot; to the persons involved.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n168</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Court has upheld the stop-and-frisk authority even though police departments vary widely in the degree to which they train and oversee officers so as to minimize its abuse. It has done so, moreover, irrespective of its recognition that the standard by which officers have to judge the propriety of their actions in detaining and frisking an individual cannot be stated in clear and readily understandable language:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*179]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Courts have used a variety of terms to capture the elusive concept of what cause is sufficient to authorize police to stop a person. Terms like &quot;articulable reasons&quot; and &quot;founded suspicion&quot; are not self-defining; they fall short of providing clear guidance dispositive of the myriad factual situations that arise. But the essence of all that has been written is that the totality of the circumstances--the whole picture--must be taken into account.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n169</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compare the holding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. There, the majority concluded that the loitering definition in Chicago's gang loitering ordinance afforded police an intolerable amount of discretion--so much discretion that the ordinance in effect entrusted police with lawmaking authority.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n170</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chicago law and its implementing regulations, however, at least facially limited the authority granted to officers and carefully defined the circumstances in which this authority might be employed--authorizing only designated officers, for example, in the first instance not to arrest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">or even to detain</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but only to issue &quot;move along&quot; orders to those gang members and their associates remaining in specified public places with no apparent reason. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority made no effort to answer the dissenters' charge that its condemnation of the Chicago ordinance was simply inconsistent with the Court's Fourth Amendment case law and the trust placed in police there to detain, to search, and even to arrest based upon &quot;spur-of-the-moment determinations about amorphous legal standards such as 'probable cause' and 'reasonable suspicion'. . . .&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n171</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, however, substantially undercuts the persuasiveness of the majority's position that the &quot;no apparent purpose&quot; language in Chicago's ordinance conferred on police a &quot;vast discretion&quot; too extravagant to be endured.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n172</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. SHORTCOMINGS IN THE COURT'S VAGUENESS ANALYSIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One response to all this could well be, &quot;So what?&quot; Perhaps the Court has been too willing to tolerate the expansive street-level &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*180]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  discretion conferred on police by broad, clear laws regulating minor misconduct, by the plethora of narrow (and commonly violated) regulations that characterize the legal environment in some spheres of human activity, and even by the Court's own Fourth Amendment case law. This is no reason to abandon whatever limited judicial control over arbitrary and capricious police enforcement that the facial vagueness doctrine represents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, this doctrine may play an important role in disciplining police discretion even if there are contexts in which it has little or no application. The threat of facial invalidation may help prevent outright delegations to police to preserve order in public places in any way they choose. It may condition police and the lawyers who assist them to take administrative steps to monitor or restrain the exercise of discretion--thereby ameliorating the problems posed by laws embodying some degree of vagueness in their terms.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n173</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, even if traditional vagueness doctrine can play at best a limited role in addressing arbitrary police enforcement, this in no way deprives the doctrine of its symbolic or expressive dimensions. It may be important, and very simply so, that the Supreme Court retains the authority to denounce the constitutional vice in laws that say that a person's use of public spaces is subject to the whim of police officers on patrol.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n174</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, these observations speak generally to the existence of the facial vagueness doctrine and not to the question of how frequently it should be invoked--or whether its invocation in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was appropriate. Despite the claims of some advocates opposing Chicago's gang loitering law, the questions it presented to the Supreme Court were neither easy nor clear-cut. Granted, it is an open question whether laws like the one at stake in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will prove to be effective in addressing gang violence and the neighborhood disintegration it can effect.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n175</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many cities like Chicago, however, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*181]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are seriously experimenting with new methods of addressing violence in their communities while at the same time attempting appropriately to limit the power of police. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority's approach to vagueness may frustrate at least some of this experimentation while doing little, in reality, to restrain the discretion of patrol officers. Indeed, this approach may even contribute to police abuse--both by fostering an illusion of judicial competence in this arena that saps energy from other efforts at police reform and by depriving police of lawful authority to deal with community problems they are expected to handle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is important, then, that the Court begin to articulate a framework within which the real issues at stake might be addressed. This framework cannot limit courts assessing the vagueness of new public order laws to consideration of the text of such laws alone; it must be based upon a realistic assessment of the nature of police patrol discretion and the efficacy of the Court's efforts to influence its character. Caught up in the abstract parsing of the Chicago law's text, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority failed to grapple realistically with the issue of police discretion in many different ways. Four principal shortcomings in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority's opinion, in particular, point in the direction of a new framework for facial vagueness review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Hypertextualism</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. First is the Court's hypertextualism. The majority's parsing of the Chicago ordinance's loitering definition at best provides a less than persuasive rationale for the Court's holding. More problematically, this hypertextual approach to vagueness may result in replacing one strategy for addressing gang loitering with others that present greater risks of police abuse. The majority claimed to have no choice in its interpretation of the Chicago ordinance, saying that it was bound by the Illinois Supreme Court's statement that the ordinance's loitering definition &quot;'provides absolute discretion to police officers to determine what activities constitute loitering.'&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n176</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fairly read, however, this single sentence in the Illinois Supreme Court's decision was not a construction of the Chicago ordinance to which the Court was bound. Rather, it was a characterization of what the ordinance's language achieved in light of the Illinois court's refusal to read any limitations into it.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n177</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As both Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas argued in their &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*182]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dissents, such characterizations are not binding on the Court: &quot;[This was] not a construction of the language (to which we are bound) but a legal conclusion (to which we most assuredly are not bound).&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n178</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority's analysis in fact hinged on its own characterization of how the &quot;apparent purpose&quot; language in the Chicago ordinance (as construed by the Illinois court) would be applied by officers on patrol. The majority reached its conclusion that the Chicago ordinance's loitering definition conferred a &quot;vast discretion&quot; on police only by assuming that virtually </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">all</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> loiterers have an apparent purpose for &quot;remaining in any one place&quot;--so that officers applying the law were required in effect to come up with their own definition of prohibited loitering. This assumption, however, is unpersuasive for the simple reason that it renders Chicago's prohibition on remaining in one place with no apparent purpose utterly meaningless. In the Solicitor General's words, such a law &quot;would prohibit nothing at all.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n179</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But once this assumption is set aside, the judgment whether the Chicago ordinance's language is sufficiently definite becomes considerably more difficult--and precisely because the law would seem to have many clear applications. Two women with neither umbrellas nor raincoats who stand in a doorway anxiously observing a downpour do manifest an apparent purpose for remaining in that doorway--namely, the purpose to stay out of the weather. Just as clearly, &quot;a group that is talking or smoking while remaining in one place would not ordinarily have an apparent purpose, since it would rarely be apparent to an observer that the group's purpose for remaining in that place--rather than walking or moving elsewhere--was to talk or smoke.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n180</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conclusion that the Chicago law has a substantial number of clear applications, moreover, is at least implicitly supported by the record in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. There is little in that record to suggest that during the period the Chicago law was enforced, police had any trouble distinguishing between those gang members and their associates who remained in one place with an apparent purpose and those loitering without any discernible reason for doing so. As the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*183]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  petitioner in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pointed out, &quot;after the many thousands of arrests under the ordinance, [the] record reflects not a single instance in which anyone . . . was arrested, or even ordered to move on, while engaged in political canvassing, planning a demonstration, . . . or doing anything else protected by the First Amendment.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n181</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The respondents could not even identify a single case in which clearly harmless loitering (admittedly falling within the statutory language) had been constrained--as, for instance, might have occurred if a social worker, minister, or other responsible adult found talking to gang members for the purpose of advising them to change their ways had been ordered to move along.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n182</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The very difficulty of the judgment demanded in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggests the importance in cases like this of considering not only the text of the law under review, but also alternative ways in which police might deal with the problem to which a given public order law is addressed. Thus, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Court should have considered whether Chicago's gang loitering law might be preferable to alternatives like juvenile curfews precisely because police discretion in the gang loitering law is more clearly restrained. It should not have overlooked the possibility that Chicago's ordinance might pose fewer problems of arbitrary enforcement than another alternative that police have used to address the problems presented by a gang's turf occupation--namely, the employment of a menu of commonly violated (but admittedly clear) rules specifically to target gang members hanging out in public places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court's neglect of these alternatives is troubling because the choice between Chicago's ordinance and these other approaches to gang loitering has serious implications for the core ambition the Court has articulated for its vagueness jurisprudence--namely, limiting the opportunity for arbitrary law enforcement. In the absence of a gang loitering law, patrol officers in a neighborhood afflicted by gang violence might turn to jaywalking, public littering, and juvenile curfew ordinances to suppress gang activity. An enforcement effort employing laws formally applicable to many people but directed narrowly at gang members, however, could well result in complaints about harassment--complaints to which police management would likely respond by citing the police &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*184]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  department's responsibility for enforcing the law.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n183</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such exchanges between police managers and community residents are not uncommon, but they have baleful effects on the project of reasonably restraining the potential for arbitrary enforcement. This is because such exchanges obscure rather than illuminate the issues surrounding the discretionary use of police authority--and in ways simply not possible when, as in the case of Chicago's gang loitering ordinance, a law is the subject of intense public scrutiny and is employed more precisely to deal with the problem for which it was enacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to suggest that the vagueness question in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was simple, nor that Chicago's gang loitering ordinance was clearly preferable to other available approaches for dealing with a gang's occupation of turf. If the Court's vagueness jurisprudence is to have an effect on the realities of street-level policing, however, it is important that the Court move beyond its narrow focus on the text of the public order laws it reviews. The Court must recognize that the facial invalidation of public order laws that are imprecise to some degree can itself promote arbitrary law enforcement--by pushing police to employ admittedly clear laws for purposes other than those for which they were enacted, and in contexts where the exercise of police discretion is concealed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n184</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vagueness doctrine's traditional concern is to avoid the potential for arbitrariness that arises when imprecise laws delegate basic policy matters to police officers on patrol.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n185</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Realism demands an acknowledgment, however, that such delegation can occur even when laws are very precise--and in ways that can make the political control of discretion more difficult than when an admittedly imprecise law is employed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The &quot;move along&quot; provision</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority next erred by neglecting to consider that the risk that Chicago's gang loitering law would be misused was mitigated by the law's limited reach--to gang loitering only when accompanied by the refusal to comply with a police order to move along, and not to gang loitering alone. The majority treated this aspect of the Chicago law dismissively, and as if it was wholly irrelevant to the ordinance's potential &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*185]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be used in an arbitrary and capricious way: &quot;That the ordinance does not permit an arrest until after a dispersal order has been disobeyed,&quot; the majority concluded, &quot;does not provide any guidance to the officer deciding whether such an order should issue.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n186</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In reality, however, this feature of the ordinance was of substantial importance to the question whether Chicago's law reasonably restrained police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is partly because the arrest power threatens individuals with serious consequences--like an arrest record--that are simply not presented by an order to &quot;move along.&quot; Indeed, by not at least commenting favorably on this aspect of the Chicago ordinance, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority missed an opportunity to point municipalities in the direction of less punitive approaches to public order problems. This is unfortunate because such approaches are clearly preferable in many contexts: when the primary interest in enacting a new ordinance is not so much to prohibit an activity entirely, as to aid police in regulating it; when behaviors (like loitering) pose serious problems in communities but do not bear the traditional hallmarks of blameworthiness associated with criminal violations; and when it is difficult for legislators to define in the abstract precisely what behaviors they wish to proscribe.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n187</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Court recognized in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Village of Hoffman Estates v The Flipside</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the need for clarity in a law depends in part on the severity of the penalties that flow from its violation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n188</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, however, the majority overlooked an analogous point--that the potentially harmful effects of legislative imprecision are ameliorated when public order laws limit the arrest authority to cases involving defiance of a police command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The significance of the Chicago ordinance's &quot;move along&quot; feature to the reasonable restraint of police discretion, moreover, is not limited to its role in softening the consequences that flow from the law's enforcement. By hinging the arrest authority on defiance of a police command rather than on simple loitering by gang members &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*186]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and their associates, the Chicago ordinance also severed, to some degree, the connection between the &quot;order maintenance&quot; and &quot;law enforcement&quot; activities of police. This severance lessened the potential for arbitrary enforcement of the gang loitering law in a manner that should also have been considered by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is now well understood, police serve an order maintenance role that is distinct from their law enforcement role in two important ways. First, police invoking a public order law in service of order maintenance ends are often less interested in &quot;enforcing the law&quot; than in &quot;maintaining a pattern of public order&quot;--in putting an end to conditions or behaviors that threaten the public peace.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n189</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, many order maintenance problems are handled on the street and informally, without any need for citation or arrest. Second, order maintenance, properly performed, is generally less adversarial than the ferreting out of serious crime.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n190</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is partly because the maintenance of public order is often negotiated and thus does not place officers in frankly confrontational relations with people on the street. In addition, order maintenance does not feed the competitive, &quot;crime fighting&quot; self-image of many patrol officers.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n191</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potential interaction between the order maintenance and law enforcement roles of police, however, complicates any analysis of the ways in which patrol officers commonly employ discretion in the performance of order maintenance tasks. Police usually request that citizens desist from behaviors threatening the public order against the backdrop of a law criminalizing the underlying conduct that is the subject of the request. Patrol officers invoking such laws, then, are often tempted to employ them in the same way that traffic regulations are frequently employed--not to encourage people to desist from problematic conduct, but to pursue broader law enforcement goals. An officer may elect to make a &quot;public order&quot; arrest, for instance, without attempting to negotiate an end to troublesome conduct. This is because his real motivation is not &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*187]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  order maintenance at all. Instead, the officer wants to arrest so that he can conduct a search incident to arrest in the hope that this search will reveal evidence of more serious crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because police at least generally expect their commands to be followed, however, limiting police authority in the first instance to the issuance of a &quot;move along&quot; order lessens the temptation on the part of police to employ a low-level public order law simply to gain the authority to search.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n192</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a significant advantage. The ferreting out of serious crime is an intensely competitive enterprise that poses a substantial risk of excessive police zeal.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n193</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Order maintenance, properly performed, is altogether different. By partially disentangling police measures that are principally directed at promoting and maintaining public order from the more adversarial business of investigating serious crime, then, the Chicago ordinance's &quot;move along&quot; feature at least reduced the risk of arbitrary and capricious enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Administrative measures</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The next area in which the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority failed to grapple realistically with the subject of police discretion concerns the Court's treatment of the Chicago Police Department's efforts to regulate and to monitor enforcement of the gang loitering law. The Court dismissed the Chicago Police Department's attempt to impose administrative controls on the use of Chicago's gang loitering ordinance, noting simply that the provision in General Order 92-4 limiting enforcement of the ordinance to designated areas in Chicago &quot;would not provide a defense to a loiterer who might be arrested elsewhere.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n194</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This and other provisions in General Order 92-4, however, if implemented carefully, had the capacity substantially to ameliorate potential problems with the discretionary enforcement of Chicago's gang loitering &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*188]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  law--and regardless whether disregard of these provisions constituted a defense at trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, it is important that police managers in Chicago at least limit the group of officers authorized to enforce Chicago's gang loitering ordinance to specially trained police knowledgeable about the gangs and gang members operating in their neighborhoods.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n195</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, to the extent that a police department structures its work to ensure that officers develop significant community-specific knowledge about the problems they are addressing, the exercise of police discretion is likely to be both better informed and more judicious. This reduces the potential for capricious exercises of police discretion to a significant degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider, for example, the position of the roving, citywide tactical team that last year confronted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in his New York City foyer. Those officers approached Diallo, a local street peddler, based on their suspicion that he had committed a serious crime. But the officers had little connection to the neighborhood they were patrolling and little community-specific knowledge to draw upon in making the street-level judgment that Diallo was a likely suspect.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n196</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The results in that case were tragic: Diallo, an immigrant with no connection to the crime the officers were investigating, ended up &quot;dead from a hail of bullets&quot; and perhaps simply because &quot;he acted furtively when confronted . . . by a band of plain-clothed armed men.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n197</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incidents involving officers confronting strange neighborhoods and people they do not know rarely end as tragically as in the Diallo case. Surely it makes a difference, however, that General Order 92-4 did not contemplate sending officers into unfamiliar neighborhoods for the purpose of &quot;rounding up&quot; gang members and their associates. The order limited enforcement of the ordinance to designated police personnel who were required to familiarize themselves with information regarding the criminal street gangs active in the neighborhoods in which these officers worked.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n198</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further, enforcement of Chicago's gang loitering ordinance &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*189]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was limited to areas designated in advance as places where gang loitering had significantly affected the surrounding community. Such designations were to derive at least in part from some measure of community consultation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n199</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The overall thrust of these provisions, then, was to encourage police to analyze a neighborhood's problems and to determine in advance the need to employ the gang loitering law in that neighborhood. Properly implemented, these provisions in General Order 92-4 had the capacity to influence the exercise of police discretion in profound and beneficial ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other provisions of Chicago's police regulations were likewise relevant to the question whether police discretion was reasonably restrained. The requirement that officers making arrests pursuant to the gang loitering law prepare written reports describing the circumstances giving rise to probable cause to arrest, for instance, represented a potentially significant constraint on the opportunity for arbitrary enforcement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n200</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Records of this type facilitate public review of exercises of police discretion and also provide police managers with helpful information about the behavior of their officers.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n201</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Order 92-4 also contemplated that the department's records regarding gang members would be regularly updated in ways designed to help ensure that officers exercising discretion in the enforcement of the gang loitering law would be acting on the basis of accurate information. Thus, these records were to contain &quot;only the names of individuals the Department had concluded that it had probable cause to believe [were] members of criminal street gangs.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n202</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The order provided for regular &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*190]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  deletion of the names of individuals apparently no longer actively involved in gang activity.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n203</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Chicago's police regulations were implemented badly. Perhaps as implemented these regulations were even inadequate to the task of restraining the discretion of Chicago police. For the purpose of the majority's analysis in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, however, it was a matter of no significance whatsoever that Chicago's police managers did much more than simply encourage widespread enforcement of the gang loitering law. This approach to vagueness is simply wrong. As the Court said in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Ward v Rock Against Racism</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the administrative interpretation and implementation of a law are &quot;highly relevant&quot; to facial vagueness analysis.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n204</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> focusing on this aspect of the case, the Court missed an opportunity to provide both legislators and police managers with the incentive to experiment with innovative administrative approaches to the reasonable restraint of police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Proposed changes to Chicago's gang loitering law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Perhaps the shortcomings in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority's approach to vagueness, however, are most evident not upon consideration of what the majority opinion omits, but upon consideration of what the Justices in the majority chose to say. Both Justice Stevens, writing for the majority, and Justice O'Connor, in her concurring opinion, empathized with the efforts of Chicago communities to address the serious gang problems afflicting them. Unusually, they even suggested ways in which Chicago might constitutionally regulate the loitering of gang members. But the very changes to Chicago's gang loitering ordinance that these Justices proposed attest to the failure of the Court to grapple realistically with the issue of police discretion. Indeed, they demonstrate that the majority has failed to fash-ion a framework for its vagueness analysis that represents an effective response to the potential for arbitrary and capricious police enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider first the majority's conclusion that a law prohibiting only loitering having an &quot;apparently harmful purpose or effect&quot; would &quot;no doubt&quot; satisfy vagueness review.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n205</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is impossible to conclude, as the majority blithely does, that officers charged with dispersing loiterers remaining in a place for an &quot;apparently harmful &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*191]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  purpose&quot; are significantly more constrained in the exercise of their discretion than officers acting to disperse those loiterers remaining for &quot;no apparent purpose&quot; whatsoever. Indeed, as the dissenters urged, an ordinance requiring officers to ascertain whether a group of loiterers has &quot;an apparently harmful purpose&quot; would seem to require these officers to exercise more discretion--more judgment in the law's application--than a law directing them to disperse loiterers hanging out for no apparent purpose at all.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n206</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, a mandate to officers to identify those loiterers remaining in any one place with &quot;apparently harmful effects&quot; would seem to require a substantial amount of judgment in its application. At least in the absence of some legislative specification of what these effects might be, such a law seems no better than the law enacted in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the Court ignores significant sociological research showing that patrol officers invoking public order laws in the service of order-maintenance ends do not consider these laws and then apply them to the facts in the manner of a law student taking an exam. Rather, police officers blend legal knowledge, &quot;common sense,&quot; and various behavioral norms in using such laws to deal with problems they are called upon to handle.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n207</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the words of one scholar:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am not aware of any descriptions of police work on the streets that support the view that patrolmen walk around, respond to service demands, or intervene in situations, with the provisions of the penal code in mind, matching what they see with some title or another, and deciding whether a particular infraction is serious enough to warrant being referred to further process.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n208</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If police do not invoke the law in the manner of a law student taking an exam, however, the subtle differences in language discussed by the majority in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are unlikely to make any difference to the behavior of officers on patrol. Such subtle differences are also unlikely to affect the potential for police arbitrariness. The majority's approach to the reform of Chicago's gang loitering law is thus unpersuasive when viewed in light of the available empirical evidence about the behavior of police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*192]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This approach, moreover, is also unpersuasive when examined entirely on its own terms. Consider yet another modification to Chicago's gang loitering law discussed by the Court. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority suggested (without explicitly affirming) that limiting the criminal penalties in Chicago's gang loitering law to gang members alone might well cure the vagueness problem identified in the ordinance.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n209</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice O'Connor, in her concurrence, was definite on this point: &quot;Limitations that restricted the ordinance's criminal penalties to gang members,&quot; she said, &quot;would avoid the vagueness problems of the ordinance as construed by the Illinois Supreme Court.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n210</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This position, however, undercuts entirely the stated rationale for the Court's holding. If the problem with the Chicago ordinance is really the one identified by the majority (namely, that the vagueness permeating the law creates too great an opportunity for its arbitrary enforcement), it makes little sense to argue that limiting the criminal penalties in Chicago's gang loitering law to gang members alone &quot;solves&quot; the problem. In Justice Scalia's words:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If &quot;remaining in one place with no apparent purpose&quot; is so vague as to give the police unbridled discretion in controlling the conduct of non-gang-members, it surpasses understanding how it ceases to be so vague when applied to gang members alone. Surely gang members cannot be decreed to be outlaws, subject to the merest whim of the police as the rest of us are not.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n211</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To a significant degree, then, it is fair to conclude that the majority in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> both failed to consider factors truly relevant to a realistic approach to police discretion and focused on factors of little account. The result is a majority opinion that does not persuade and cannot assist localities in developing meaningful restraints on arbitrary and capricious law enforcement. This is not to say that a more realistic jurisprudence can render judgments like the one called for in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> simple and clear-cut. Such a jurisprudence, however, could encourage localities to experiment with &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*193]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  approaches to the policing of public order that might more meaningfully constrain the opportunity for police arbitrariness.<BR><BR>III. A REALISTIC VAGUENESS JURISPRUDENCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how might a more realistic vagueness jurisprudence look? At the start, such a jurisprudence would be rooted in a recognition of both the breadth of police enforcement discretion and the necessity for such discretion if police are adequately to perform their jobs. Police discretion, especially in the enforcement of lowlevel offenses, is a necessary consequence of limited resources and the need to prioritize. Beyond these factors, moreover, it is also a natural outgrowth of other variables: the recognition that not all problems faced by police are best addressed through law enforcement, and that not all communities can or will tolerate full enforcement of laws specified by the legislature. This may seem obvious to informed observers today. As Justice O'Connor stated in her concurrence, &quot;some degree of police discretion is necessary to allow the police 'to perform their peacekeeping responsibilities satisfactorily.'&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n212</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As recently as forty years ago, however, &quot;the prevalent assumption of both the police and the public was that the police had no discretion--that their job was to function in strict accordance with the law.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n213</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And this notion that police are ministerial officers--an idea that police have sometimes encouraged--still pervades much of the public discourse about law enforcement in ways detrimental to the reasonable restraint of arbitrary and capricious police behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, it is equally important to affirm that police can be held reasonably accountable for the exercise of enforcement discretion. Much of the discussion here has emphasized the degree to which the void-for-vagueness doctrine creates an illusory sense of formal accountability in its command that laws be sufficiently precise so as to reasonably constrain enforcement discretion. Indeed, the doctrine has been cast in the worst of all possible lights: as an ineffective constraint on abusive police conduct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">that may even contribute to such abuse</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by casting officers left without lawful authority &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*194]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to address real community problems in the role of &quot;dirty workers&quot; who furtively bend rules or employ inappropriate laws to deal effectively with the situations they are called upon to handle.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n214</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vagueness doctrine, however, is but one small part of the legal and sociopolitical context in which police operate. Granted, there are police departments in which enforcement discretion, if not explicitly denied by police managers, is still exercised in a sub rosa and ad hoc fashion. There are also police departments, however, in which effective constraints on the opportunity for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement have already emerged--in which a substantial effort is made to acknowledge enforcement discretion, to seek input from communities about its exercise, and to learn from experimentation within the department with different methods or styles of law enforcement. The differences between these two types of police department, moreover, translate into significantly different potentials for the arbitrary and capricious exercise of enforcement authority--and regardless of any differences in the clarity of the laws that they enforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A realistic vagueness jurisprudence, then, should work to stimulate local police departments to experiment with new and promising methods of promoting accountability in the exercise of police discretion. Admittedly, this is no easy task. The objectives behind the rules and procedures set by courts are always at least partially transformed by their interaction with the subcultural rules of police, the police organization's internal structure, and the practical exigencies of policing.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n215</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My colleague Michael Dorf's model of &quot;provisional adjudication,&quot; however, outlines a way in which courts might focus more attention on the likely consequences of their decisions in order to find workable solutions to the problems they must address.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n216</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This form of adjudication is premised on the recognition that courts sometimes need to learn from experimentation with varied approaches to such problems. Professor Dorf's work suggests how courts might import some measure of realism &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*195]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  into their facial vagueness assessments without thereby assuming the impossible burden of providing one-shot, definitive answers to empirical and policy questions concerning the best way in which to restrain police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simply stated, courts addressing difficult vagueness questions should consider whether the exercise of police discretion contemplated in challenged public order legislation will take place under conditions that provide reasonable assurances that the relevant police department will be accountable for the way in which it employs this discretion. Such assurances will not derive solely from the clarity of the statutory text, however, but from a more realistic assessment of the ways in which a public order law will be used. This approach to facial vagueness would both permit and stimulate experimentation with different methods of promoting police accountability. By tolerating some measure of disagreement among state and lower federal courts regarding the reasonableness of such methods, the Supreme Court might further encourage this experimentation. The Court might also maximize its own ability over time to make at least some judgments about the relative efficacy of these various methods of ensuring that the exercise of police discretion is reasonably constrained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This approach to vagueness thus differs sharply from that endorsed by Kenneth Culp Davis, one of the early writers on the void-for-vagueness doctrine and its role in restraining police. Professor Davis recognized the limited effects of the vagueness doctrine on the scope of police enforcement discretion and proposed that the Court should extend the vagueness principle beyond the face of legislation to address vagueness in police enforcement policies:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court [in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Papachristou v City of Jacksonville</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] quite properly responded to the problem before it in asserting that lack of standards in the ordinance is unconstitutional. But I think the fundamental [point] may be broader--that vagueness of law or of enforcement policy is unconstitutional because it permits or encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the law. . . . I do predict that the time will come when courts will generally hold that unnecessary or undue vagueness in an enforcement policy is unconstitutional, because of the reasons the unanimous Supreme Court stated in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Papachristou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opinion.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n217</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*196]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Court never adopted this proposal, for what seem in retrospect to be good and sufficient reasons. As Professor Davis himself admitted, the task for the Court of working out the limits and applications of his idea was truly &quot;enormous.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n218</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would have required courts across the country to determine for thousands of farflung police agencies whether &quot;unnecessary or undue vagueness&quot; in their enforcement policies rendered these policies unconstitutional--a difficult job for generalist courts lacking knowledge about both internal law enforcement practices and the public order problems faced by police.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n219</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even more fundamentally, Davis's work on police discretion did not grapple fully with the difficulties of drafting enforcement rules both sufficiently precise to establish accountability in the terms he contemplated and still flexible enough to achieve tolerably adequate results in terms of the problems with which police must deal.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n220</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nor did Davis fully explore the question whether the mere elaboration of enforcement policies could even meaningfully constrain police in their routine encounters with citizens on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis's insight was important: that courts concerned about reducing the potential for arbitrary and discriminatory police enforcement needed to focus more attention on the ways in which police actually employ laws regulating low-level misconduct. But his proposal demanded too much and too little at the very same time. The inadequacies of Davis's proposal, however, contain lessons that point in the direction of the alternative approach outlined here. This approach does not require courts to take on the task of passing on all enforcement policies. It does not lock police departments into overly rigid administrative rules that frustrate accomplishment of the substantive ends of policing while at the same time failing in their objective to constrain police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the place to specify all the features in a given law or its implementing plan that a more realistic approach to vagueness might take into account. Like all tests premised on reasonableness, the one articulated here will permit many factors to be &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*197]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  considered. We can articulate some principles, however, that might guide the overall analysis of the question whether police enforcement discretion has been reasonably constrained.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n221</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The articulation of these principles, moreover, can serve as prelude to some final consideration of a more realistic approach to vagueness in the area of public order policing.<BR><BR>A. THREE PRINCIPLES OF A REALISTIC VAGUENESS JURISPRUDENCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Openness</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. First is the principle of openness. As I have suggested, the healthy evolution of police organizations has long been stymied by the failure of police departments frankly to acknowledge the broad scope of police discretion and to explain the rationale for its exercise in different ways. Accountability is simply not possible when discretion is exercised furtively and with an air of illegitimacy. There are few reasons, moreover, for the secrecy that has often surrounded the formulation and implementation of enforcement policies involving public order problems. The goal of enforcement in this context is not the detection and punishment of offenders (a goal that may require that enforcement rationales remain unexplained), but compliance with legislated behavioral norms. Indeed, the public discussion of a public order problem and the police department's proposed response may help ameliorate the problem before enforcement ever takes place. And there is much to be gained from openness about enforcement discretion in terms of limiting the opportunity for its abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts evaluating whether the admitted vagueness in a given public order law is tolerable, then, should consider whether the police department implementing this law is participating in a process in which it explains its reasons for employing the law in a given way and also reports on its results in a manner that permits evaluation of the efficacy and propriety of the strategy it has chosen.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n222</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the case of Chicago's gang loitering law, for instance, it is certainly relevant that General Order 92-4, even without public designation of the specific places in which the law would be enforced, did specify the criteria for designating a given area in Chicago &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*198]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for gang loitering enforcement. It is likewise relevant that the law required the preparation of written reports each time an arrest was made. Standing alone, these measures might not be enough to render a given public order law constitutional. Such measures point in the right direction, however--toward the open acknowledgment of enforcement discretion and the provision of adequate information to ensure that exercises of discretion can be appropriately reviewed within a community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Monitoring</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. As a second principle of accountability, courts examining a public order law that might be vulnerable to facial vagueness invalidation should also consider whether this law is being employed in such a way as to provide for effective monitoring of its enforcement. Monitoring mechanisms can take a variety of forms. Monitoring might be performed by a legislative oversight committee armed with the rich information about enforcement that a reasonably constrained police department could be required to provide. Courts might participate in this role through their consideration of &quot;as applied&quot; challenges and their review of the sufficiency of the evidence in individual cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps most promisingly, the monitoring function might also arise from the premises of community policing. In a police department that has implemented the principles of this substantive policing theory, neighborhood residents are involved in identifying local public order problems and prioritizing among them &quot;in a constructive dialogue with one another and with police officers who work in their immediate area.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n223</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Chicago, this effort at police-community partnership occurs at monthly public meetings held in each of the city's 279 small police beats.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n224</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In theory, when police and citizens meet together &quot;to report on what they have accomplished since the last meeting, and what they will work on next,&quot; this form of cooperation can itself play an important role in monitoring police order maintenance activities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n225</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly when the implementation of a challenged public order law is built into such an organizational framework--a framework dedicated to &quot;securing month-in, month-out accountability to residents for &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*199]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  what beat officers are doing&quot;--this is a relevant factor to consider in assessing the likelihood that this law will be employed in an arbitrary and capricious way.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n226</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Limited police authority</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Third and finally, courts evaluating whether the measure of indeterminacy in a given public order law is acceptable should consider whether reasonable efforts have been made to limit police authority. This is simply an extension of traditional vagueness review. In employing the facial vagueness doctrine, courts already purport to limit police authority by forcing legislatures to define prohibited conduct more carefully so that patrol officers cannot arbitrarily employ overly ambiguous laws. The principle at work here is precisely the same--that reasonable constraints on enforcement authority are beneficial because they reduce the opportunity for police abuse. In a more realistic approach to vagueness, however, such constraints need not derive solely from clarity in an ordinance's text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, courts might consider whether a police department, in ways analogous to an administrative agency, has given a law's restrictions &quot;more precise shape&quot; in advance of &quot;subjecting citizens to penalties for unwanted behavior.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n227</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They might take into account both provisions for warnings before arrest and regulations like the one in General Order 92-4 limiting enforcement authority to specially designated officers. Even things like sunset provisions, surprisingly, might count in this fuller analysis--as imposing a time limitation within which a given degree of police enforcement authority will be tolerated and also at least potentially attesting to a good faith effort on the part of the legislative body to ensure a periodic reassessment whether police are implementing a public order law in a fair and equitable way.<BR><BR>B. A REALISTIC VAGUENESS JURISPRUDENCE REASSESSED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constitutional test outlined here does not constitute a radical departure for the vagueness doctrine, even if the adjudication of facial vagueness challenges pursuant to this test might require hearings and the amassing of an evidentiary record in ways not &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*200]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  often deemed necessary in the traditional approach. This is because the test does not reject the central premise of the Court's vagueness jurisprudence--namely, that courts bear some constitutional responsibility for limiting the opportunity for the arbitrary application of legal prohibitions. Instead, the test seeks to transcend the limitations of the doctrine as employed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and in ways that offer the reasonable prospect that courts might actually--as opposed to symbolically--promote the accountability of police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The test has two concrete advantages. First, this test avoids the false choice evident in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opinions. These opinions seem to proffer only two options for courts employing the facial vagueness doctrine. First is the majority's approach: an approach to facial vagueness that authorizes courts to second-guess community preferences about the regulation of public order in what is at best an illusory response to the problems posed by unconstrained police. Second is the dissenters' approach. Admittedly, this approach avoids even the appearance that courts are engaged in the ad hoc review of public order legislation. It avoids this appearance, however, only by so limiting the facial vagueness doctrine as to essentially repudiate any role for this doctrine in contributing to the reasonable constraint of police. The present test, in contrast, focuses courts on a realistic assessment of the ways in which public order laws will be used. This focus guides judicial decision making so that opinions in this area can be both persuasive and effective in the terms in which they are written.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the constitutional test outlined here stimulates those actors best able to devise and then to experiment with new and effective approaches to the reasonable constraint of police--namely, legislatures and police departments. The incentives set by current vagueness doctrine send these actors off on a chimerical quest for ever greater standards of clarity in the public order laws they propose. A realistic approach to vagueness doctrine, in contrast, enlists them in experiments that will have real-world consequences for the ways in which police employ public order laws on the street. This approach thus promotes police accountability. But it does not impose on generalist courts the impossible task of fully defining the conditions pursuant to which accountability can be achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One objection to this analysis might be that it proposes what &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*201]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  amounts to a one-way ratchet. Thus, some public order laws now vulnerable to facial vagueness review might be upheld pursuant to this approach. Relatively clear laws could not be challenged for vagueness, however, despite the opportunity for arbitrary enforcement they present. This &quot;realistic&quot; approach to the void-for-vagueness doctrine, then, in effect expands police power. This objection, however, ignores both the benefits that would accrue from the realistic approach and the detriments that now flow from sometimes denying police legitimate authority to deal with problems they are expected to handle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The benefits of the realistic approach could be considerable. By encouraging police departments to adopt measures that open up police enforcement discretion to monitoring and that reasonably constrain the scope of police authority, courts may generate changes not only in the area of order maintenance, but in other areas of police work as well. Police may come to recognize that they have much to gain from the favorable review of monitoring authorities. They may begin to appreciate the value of openness as a way in which more generally to enlist community support for enforcement efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the realistic approach to vagueness has no ripple effects on other contexts in which police exercise discretion, however, this approach is still preferable to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority's approach. Courts do no service to the project of police reform when they enunciate tests that create an illusion of constraint that does not in fact exist. Nor do they promote police accountability by denying police legitimate authority to address community problems. The realistic approach offers a better way in which to assess whether the vagueness in a public order law truly threatens to promote arbitrariness on the street. Moreover, it brings courts closer to realizing the aspiration that courts themselves have articulated for the facial vagueness doctrine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made little progress in illuminating pressing issues concerning the relationship between police and communities. I should acknowledge in conclusion, however, that the Court's failure to shed light on these issues may be only partly attributable to the way in which the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority approached the subject of police discretion. Indeed, the majority's suggestion that Chicago's gang loitering ordinance might be valid if applied &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*202]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to gang members alone raises the possibility that it was Chicago's regulation of &quot;innocent conduct,&quot; rather than concerns about police discretion, that really drove the result in this case.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"><SUP>n228</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not my purpose in this conclusion to address the substantive dimensions of vagueness review. But a brief observation on the substantive undercurrents to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is in order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facial vagueness doctrine is sometimes employed by courts embracing Professor Sunstein's &quot;judicial minimalism&quot; to avoid difficult substantive issues--as when a potentially suspect law is invalidated for vagueness, leaving open the question whether this law was unconstitutional on other, substantive grounds. Admittedly, there are often good reasons for the judicial reticence that this substantive use of vagueness permits. Such reticence, however, is not always to be applauded. And perhaps it should not be applauded here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the problem whether Chicago's gang loitering ordinance infringed fundamental rights is complex, so too is the problem faced by communities seeking both to restrain their police and to confer on them those reasonable powers that might be of help in dealing with pressing problems of crime and disorder. Granted, realism about police patrol cannot illuminate the question whether activities like public loitering are protected by the Due Process Clause. Such realism, however, can help communities to better regulate their police. This article has suggested that the police need to deal forthrightly with communities in acknowledging their exercise of discretion and in seeking terms of accountability. If this is true for police, however, it may also be true for the Court. To the extent that substantive considerations are important to the outcome of cases like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Court may help communities by at least focusing them on the issues truly at stake in the regulation of public order. Perhaps it is time for the Justices, like police, to speak clearly.</SPAN></P>

First, the ordinance's prohibition on loitering &quot;with no apparent purpose,&quot; the plurality said, did not interfere with the First Amendment rights of those loitering for the apparent purpose of communicating ideas. Second, the ordinance, by not reaching associations for the purpose of engaging in core First Amendment activities or intimate human associations, failed to implicate any right protected by the right of association.

In his opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, Justice Breyer similarly suggested that facial invalidation for vagueness is proper whenever a law delegates so much discretion to police that it can fairly be said that &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">every</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"> application of the ordinance represents an exercise of unlimited discretion.&quot; Id at 1866 (Breyer concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (emphasis added). He argued that in this sense, facial invalidation for vagueness is unlike those cases in which the Court has entertained a facial challenge for overbreadth in the First Amendment context. In the latter cases, &quot;a defendant whose conduct clearly falls within the law and may be constitutionally prohibited can nonetheless have the law declared facially invalid to protect the rights of others (whose protected speech might otherwise be chilled).&quot; A law permeated with vagueness, in contrast, confers so much unchecked discretion on enforcement authorities that it is &quot;invalid in all its applications.&quot; Accordingly, the right that defendants assert in facial vagueness cases--namely, &quot;the right to be free from the officer's exercise of unchecked discretion&quot;--is, in Justice Breyer's view, &quot;more clearly their own.&quot; Id.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father of Ahmed Diallo last night said the cops who gunned his son down should be behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish, I hope, they will be arrested,&quot; Saikou Diallo told a throng of reporters shortly after landing at Kennedy Airport. &quot;I hope, yes, to get justice in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His face set, his jaw clenched, the despondent dad drew comfort from the embrace of several dozen fellow Guineans some wearing the bright blue flowing robes of their West African country after getting off a flight from Vietnam, where he had been on business. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are here to show our support for the family,&quot; said Alhassane Diop, 42, of Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Rev. Al Sharpton on his arm, Saikou Diallo thwarted city officials' attempts to steer him away from reporters and then later headed to the Bronx apartment at 1157 Wheeler Ave., where his 22-year-old son lived and died. Surrounded by grieving friends and relatives, Diallo renewed his call for the cops' arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need justice,&quot; he said, his eyes brimming with tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo learned of the tragedy in a telephone call from a friend in New York, Mohamed Diop. His son died when four cops fired 41 bullets at him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I told him that his son was killed by police officers by accident,&quot; Diop said. &quot;All he said was, 'I'm very sorry. I'm hurt that they killed my son. I am coming.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family and friends of the slain street vendor expressed confidence the accused cops would be held accountable. &quot;We know whether it's now or 10,000 years later, justice will be done,&quot; the victim's aunt, Nama Conde, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning, the Diallo family will seek an independent autopsy to find out if the officers continued to fire after Diallo was down, Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parents may take their son's body back to Guinea as soon as Saturday. Both have refused Mayor Giuliani's offer for financial assistance to transport the remains. A prayer service at a Manhattan mosque is planned for tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo's mother, Kadiadou, remained in seclusion a day after she visited the shooting scene and made a plea for justice in a case that has thrown fresh fuel on smoldering distrust about police treatment of minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other developments, the local community board in Soundview last night called on the community to attend a Feb. 21 march on Bronx Borough Police Headquarters, where a rally and prayer vigil will be held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This incident is not surprising,&quot; Elizabeth Rodriguez, the board's chairwoman, said. &quot;We have had complaints repeatedly from the community of harassment, verbal abuse and physical abuse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also at the meeting, Assemblyman Peter Rivera (D-Parkchester) said he will introduce legislation calling for mandatory drug and alcohol testing of police officers within two hours of discharging their weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, City Council members renewed demands that cops live in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Mayor Ed Koch joined Manhattan Borough President Virginia Fields to accuse Giuliani of being insensitive to allegations of police brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koch said Giuliani had lost his &quot;credibility&quot; on the issue of brutality by ignoring the recommendations of a commission Giuliani had appointed to study the brutal 1997 beating of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani dismissed the criticism from Koch and Fields. &quot;This was not like a serious discussion of a substantive problem, but rather a political press conference,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, one of the victim's cousins said Ahmed Diallo's mother had named her son after her father, who stayed behind in the village of Lelouma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since they told the grandfather what happened, he cannot get out of bed,&quot; said the cousin, who has the same name as the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cousin said he encouraged the mother to permit her son to immigrate to New York three years ago. Once here, the cousin said, Diallo worked hard as a street peddler, but planned to return to school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I was in school, he came to my house to play with the computer,&quot; the cousin said. &quot;His idea was to raise some money and go back to school.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE CAPTION for the story of Ahmed Diallo's death can be found in the police transmissions made on the night he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Member of Service involved in shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One suspect down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect, Mr. Diallo, was suspected of being suspicious. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the firing began, the shell casings that ejected from the guns were hitting the other officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The crux of the matter is that they believed they were being fired on or were in danger of it,&quot; said an attorney who has advised the police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning, the Diallo family will be seeking their own independent autopsy, the Rev. Al Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The autopsy should tell if the officers continued to fire after Diallo collapsed. Once he was on the ground, he could hardly be seen to pose a threat that justified more shots. It is possible that Diallo was not felled by the early rounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hollow-point bullets cannot go right through the body, so he may literally have been kept on his feet by the gunfire,&quot; said an expert consulted by the Diallo family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard the three shots first,&quot; said Wanda Vela, who lives at 1146 Wheeler Ave., across from the scene of the shooting. &quot;It paused for, like, two seconds. Then all the shots were following after that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When medical assistance arrived, the first medics were told to watch their step because of the casings on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You could hardly put your foot down without stepping on shell casings,&quot; said one of the medics. &quot;I was sure that it was a drug assassination that an Uzi or a Tec-9 had been used. I didn't know it was a police shooting. Whoever did it, it looked like they sure wanted him dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details on how Mr. Diallo died will be worked out. Whatever the medical examiner says, the true cause of death is likely to be panic, with contributing factors listed as ignorance and excess aggression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We already know that the city's own records showed that the hyperaggressive tactics of the street crime unit have become increasingly unproductive. Far more people are being subjected to frisks by police, but fewer are being arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Police Commissioner Howard Safir and Mayor Giuliani, the street crime unit stopped and frisked 50% more people in 1998 than it did in 1997, an increase to 27,061 stops from 18,023. Yet the number of people arrested actually dropped declining from 4,899 in 1997 to 4,647 in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So for every alleged criminal arrested, five innocent people were held by the police for searches. Virtually all of those stopped are black and Latino males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last summer and fall, the police in central Brooklyn went on a campaign that involved putting people in jail for such minor offenses as riding bicycles without bells or selling peeled fruit in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, virtually all those subjected to 24 hours or more in custody were black and Latino males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the police commissioner issued a false public statement that the people involved had been committing other crimes. His statement was contradicted by the Brooklyn district attorney's office and the criminal court judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police officers broke down the doors of innocent people, the commissioner basically scoffed at the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the torture of Abner Louima was exposed by the late Mike McAlary of the Daily News, Mayor Giuliani met with Louima and appointed a special task force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Months later, he mocked the 150-page report written by his own allies as &quot;unrealistic&quot; and said they &quot;make very little sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOW, OTHER JOURNALISTS, including Pablo Guzman of WCBS-TV, have raised questions about the shooting of Diallo. The mayor has gone out of his way to show hospitality to the family and to curtail a political trip to be present at the prayer service tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He went to Abner Louima and said he would get to the bottom of it,&quot; said Sharpton. &quot;Then he threw out his own commission's report. Why should we believe him now?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days after Ahmed Diallo was shot by cops, Police Commissioner Howard Safir left New York for a convention in Los Angeles. He came back yesterday, a day early. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If warranted, he would have come back [even earlier],&quot; said Marilyn Mode, Safir's chief spokeswoman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Councilman Sheldon Leffler (D-Queens) said Safir's time could have been better spent in New York, with emotions tense over Diallo's slaying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all know there's a lot of down time at these conventions, there's a lot of shmoozing,&quot; Leffler said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mode said Safir was in contact with his top police aides and Mayor Giuliani. She said his decision to return early was discussed with the mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani said yesterday he canceled a fund-raising trip to Texas &quot;because I wanted to be sensitive to the needs of the [Diallo] family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safir appeared at a City Hall press conference Friday, then met with officials from the African Central Council that night. The next day, he and wife Carol jetted to Los Angeles for the annual International Chiefs of Police convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two large anti-police demonstrations occurred in his absence. First Deputy Commissioner Patrick Kelleher was in charge while Safir was away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Mayor Ed Koch gave Safir a lukewarm defense: &quot;I don't think we should look for opportunities to flail the police commissioner. There are too many legitimate opportunities that we don't have to look for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the four cops who shot an unarmed Ahmed Diallo were in a semi-circle about 10 feet away when they let loose a fierce fusillade that ended his life and started a public outcry, law enforcement sources said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fourth cop involved in the shooting was a little farther away, crouching behind a civilian car at the curb, when he, too, opened fire, eight witnesses have told investigators for the Bronx district attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statements from the witnesses do not answer all key questions about the fatal shooting of Diallo in front of his Bronx building early last Thursday, but their words offer important new details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said that none of the witnesses saw the bullets strike Diallo, 22, a street vendor with no criminal past, or what preceded the shooting. Except for one who was across the street, the eight witnesses reside in the same building in Soundview where Diallo lived with two roommates after coming to New York about three years ago from Guinea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some witnesses said they saw parts of the incident, but none of them could see into the building vestibule where Diallo was standing when the cops left their unmarked car and walked toward the steps leading up to the vestibule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An attorney for the cops, who were part of a special undercover street-crime team searching for a rape suspect, said the officers fired their powerful 9-mm. weapons after one or more of them thought Diallo was reaching for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo was hit by 19 of the 41 bullets; the slugs struck up and down the left side of his body, except for one in the chest that probably killed him, the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No gun was found. On the floor near where Diallo lay crumpled in the shower of bullets, investigators found his wallet and his beeper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The beeper's belt clip was broken, either by a bullet or when it fell. His keys, which his friends said he may have been fishing for to get inside, were found in a pocket of his pants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the witnesses, who are expected to begin telling their stories to a Bronx grand jury next week, heard the police officers say anything. Diallo's roommates were home, but asleep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witnesses' accounts differ in small ways, such as whether there was a pause between volleys of shots. Investigators remain hopeful that additional witnesses will come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean Carroll, one of the cops involved in the shooting, told the Daily News earlier this week that he was &quot;deeply sorry&quot; and would cooperate &quot;100%&quot; with the investigation, which is being conducted by the Bronx district attorney's office and monitored by the FBI and Manhattan U.S. attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other cops Kenneth Boss, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy have not spoken publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four have been represented by a single lawyer, Stephen Worth, but are expected to retain separate counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be improper to represent all four, certainly at the grand jury stage,&quot; said Worth, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association lawyer who has been speaking for the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has said the cops showed Diallo their police badges and identified themselves as police when they confronted the street peddler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Worth has added, the situation grew tense when Diallo, described by friends and family as a shy, stuttering man with limited command of English, began acting agitated and appeared to reach for a gun.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE DEATH last week of an unarmed African immigrant in a fusillade of bullets unleashed by four white police officers has lit a bonfire under simmering racial tension in New York and directed the spotlight on the zero-tolerance law-enforcement policies of the city's Republican mayor, Rudolph Giuliani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Confusion surrounds the circumstances of the incident when the four officers fired 41 shots at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an immigrant from Guinea, West Africa, after apparently confronting him last Thursday in the hallway of the Bronx apartment building where he lived last. He died from 19 bullet wounds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leaders of the black community, including the veteran activist and political firebrand the Rev Al Sharpton, have demanded a federal investigation of the shooting, saying that it exposes a policy of indiscriminate brutality by the city's police against innocent African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Emotions are expected to run high at a memorial service to be held in Harlem tomorrow. Mr Diallo, 22, arrived in New York from Guinea two years ago and worked as a street vendor in Manhattan. He spoke almost no English and was carrying only a wallet and a beeper when he was gunned down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lawyers for the four officers, who are expected to testify shortly before a grand jury, have said they opened fire because they believed Mr Diallo was armed and may have been reaching for a gun when they challenged him.  They were patrolling the area in search of a serial rapist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The affair has ballooned into a crisis for Mr Giuliani, who cancelled a political visit to Texas today to attend the memorial service. The Mayor, who meets the British Opposition Leader, William Hague, here on Saturday, was the object of passionate denouncement at a rally of more than 1,000 people, almost all of them African Americans, outside City Hall on yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If they can shoot anyone 41 times, they can shoot everyone 41 times,&quot; Mr Sharpton told the angry crowd. &quot;It may start with blacks and Latinos but it will spread everywhere&quot;. He led the throng in chanting &quot;No justice, no peace&quot; as many waved banners accusing Mr Giuliani of condoning police brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shooting has become a symbol of the darker side of the zero-tolerance approach adopted under Mr Giuliani's administration, which has otherwise been credited with a drop in violent-crime rates. &quot;This just shows how the police will shoot a black man for no reason,&quot; said Shahir Mack, one of the many children at the City Hall rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The victim's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, flew to New York from Guinea and visited the Bronx apartment house where her son died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Emerging from a black van, she fell to her knees before throngs of reporters and sympathisers wailing &quot;Why? Why? Why?&quot; She then stumbled to the building, repeatedly crying out &quot;Amadou, Amadou, Amadou&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She and her husband, who is due here today, will take the body back to Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York's Police Commissioner, Howard Safir, ordered his department to arrange refresher courses for street-crime units to instruct them on approaching suspects and determining whether or not they are armed and represent a genuine security threat.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in this city's passionate sympathy for his mother, Kadiadou Diallo, while we remember, also lest we forget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we remember the blood on Wheeler Avenue in The Bronx, lest we forget the sound of taps - that eerie trumpet weeping when a slain cop is laid to rest in front of wife, kids and loved ones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not an excuse for Wheeler Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> followed his dream to America from a torn continent. The dream ended in a hail of bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother protested and so did many, of all physical and political colors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their grief, their loss, was not only totally predictable, understandable and emotional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You, I, the mayor, the cops, the police commissioner, the lawyer for the four accused cops, want answers sooner than later, more than less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK, are we going to make private grief, desperate loss, public sympathy, a platform for cop-bashing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You see, the Rev. Al Sharpton, one of the sharpest guys I have ever met, one of the slickest hustlers since Ponzi, one of the best orators I have heard, one of the most honesty-challenged dilettantes I have ever seen, will not go to sleep tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, he will be dreaming awake. How can I turn this into another chance to bash cops? Oh, I know Al.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it be his alleged FBI-informant role on his own people, exposed in Newsday, or his alleged IRS hustle, or his pathological bull dust in the Tawana Brawley trial, oh yeah, he's good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a community leader, why should he be there? If he is anti-cop, OK, that is covered by every centimeter of the constitution. No fight here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK, I have said before that I have never seen him attend the funeral of a murdered cop. His choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I heard little from him when six black detectives got into a problem with a cook in a bar in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Dec. 19, 1997. A shot was fired, allegedly by one of the cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four of those six cops were indicted for assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim, Reginald Bannerman, ended up dead. Now, I am on the side of those black detectives because, first, they haven't been dealt with in court and second, I believe their innocence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But where was Al Sharpton?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen, next to losing your partner or being killed yourself, the worst is to put a gun on a perp,&quot; said Jimmy Higgins, recording secretary of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy knows. He shot a violent madman dead outside Yankee Stadium and it does not sit easy with him today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sharpton just stirs the racial pot - which brings out the worst among us on all sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's too bad, because crime here has dropped through the floor, making New York one of the safest cities in the country, per capita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor and the commissioner deserve credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of all, the cops deserve credit. But Al Sharpton gives speeches that sound like he wants to wipe them from the face of the Earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Mancini of the PBA gave me a list of cops killed protecting places in The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan and Staten Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't have the space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know what to say to the mother of this dead young man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I do know that Al Sharpton should help this tragic family with quiet dignity - not bombastic rabble-rousing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It does them no good, hurts good, heroic cops - and tears us all apart.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Giuliani's attendance at tomorrow's memorial service for police-shooting victim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a big question mark last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an afternoon briefing, the mayor got testy when asked if he was going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think you've asked enough questions on that subject,&quot; he told a reporter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, his spokeswoman, Cristyne Lategano, said the mayor, who canceled a trip to Texas, hadn't yet been invited to the memorial at a Manhattan mosque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mayor cleared his schedule for Friday. He's willing to attend the wake, he's willing to attend the funeral,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, who is advising the Diallo family, said Giuliani is welcome at the service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have no problem with the mayor,&quot; he said. &quot;Anybody can come.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Police Commissioner Howard Safir deflected criticism of his trip to Los Angeles for the Major Cities' Police Chief Conference in the wake of the Diallo shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safir said he decided to keep his long-standing appointment after he met last Friday with leaders of the Central African Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said they needed to go back to their community knowing the case would be fully investigated and the facts handled appropriately,&quot; Safir said as he prepared to fly back to New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've worked with them before and gave them assurances that it would be fully investigated and that it was a top priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They felt confident and accepted my assurance that I would look into the matter fully and the facts would come out, and they said they would calm their community, which they did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he told the African council members he planned to be out of town a few days, and they voiced no concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a bogus issue,&quot; Safir said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioner had scrubbed plans to attend eight previous conferences, but decided to go this time because he was speaking about DNA and its role in fighting crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safir, who left New York last Saturday, planned to be back in time for today's meetings with Giuliani and community leaders and for tomorrow's memorial service.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaving a Manhattan hotel after a brief meeting with the victim's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, Cochran was tight-lipped, refusing to discuss his involvement in the case. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had seen a lot of the world, but it was in New York that he hoped he would make his mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He pressured his mother. He wanted to come to New York,&quot; a cousin who shares the same first and last name said yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He kept talking to her about it and when she came to visit, she asked me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young man's mother feared her son - then a shy and gentle 19-year-old - would not fit in here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His mother was worried he would not be able to handle himself in New York, not protect himself because he was too timid,&quot; the cousin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She wondered if she should send him here. I said, 'Yes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it was that 2 years ago, Diallo left Guinea for New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was well-traveled and well-educated, from a middle-class family. His father was a gold buyer and his mother sold precious gemstones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family - Amadou is the oldest of four children - moved from Guinea to Togo when he was about 4 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, when he was a teen-ager, the Diallos pulled up stakes again and moved to Thailand, where he attended the French International School in Bangkok.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time he graduated, Diallo was fluent in five languages - his native Fulani, English, French, Spanish and Thai - and could read Arabic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A close family friend, Marlyatou Barry-Toure, said he was only interested in studying and prayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was extremely calm,&quot; she said. &quot;I used to be worried because he was like no other teen-ager. He was very caring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He would ask you if you wanted something, and then he would keep quiet all day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father, Saikou, separated from his mother several years earlier and moved to Singapore, then to Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amadou saw him often on holidays, and he traveled widely in Asia during those vacations, visiting Hong Kong, Malaysia and Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What he really dreamed of, though, was moving to America and saving enough money to study computers at a college in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He just wanted to study and be independent,&quot; his cousin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his mother finally convinced that he would be safe, Diallo struck out for New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lived with relatives and then a couple of roommates in The Bronx, working 12-hour days six days a week selling hats and gloves on 14th Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Thursday, the worst fears his mother harbored came true when four cops shot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and family wonder how it could have happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His mother right now doesn't understand,&quot; his cousin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She doesn't understand how somebody so calm, who cannot even kill a rat, could be killed like an animal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forty-one bullets. Nineteen of them hit a West African immigrant named </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 22, who was mowed down -- literally the case -- in the Bronx last week. The killers were four policemen from the storied Street Crimes Unit. When it was all over, it was determined that Diallo was armed only with a black complexion. He apparently had no weapon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost instantly, everyone took their assigned roles. The mayor called the killing &quot;a tragedy,&quot; but pleaded with everyone to await the outcome of the investigation being conducted by the Bronx district attorney. Al Sharpton organized a City Hall demonstration, some civil libertarians voiced concern about &quot;cowboy cops,&quot; but the rest of the city, as is its wont, went on with its business -- which is, as we all know, the business of making money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I should spare New York some of my acrid sarcasm because it is, when you think about it, typical of other cities. It has made a pretty basic decision which goes something like this: In the greater cause of justice, it will put up with some injustice. Specifically, that means it will not too closely inquire how the Street Crimes Unit, with less than 2 percent of the NYPD's officers, makes 40 percent of the department's gun arrests. They have to be awfully aggressive and, occasionally, something goes wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us talk about China and human rights. When we do, someone delivers a lecture about how we and they see things differently. We are concerned with the individual -- &quot;all men are created equal,&quot; etc. -- while they care only about society as a whole. Individuals don't matter, which is why they lock up people for mere political dissent and we, in sincere horror, voice our indignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But think for a moment: Don't we do something similar when it comes to crime? New York City is but one example. Skip to Chicago and something that happened there recently -- the exoneration of a man who had spent 16 years on death row. Anthony Porter was freed after some crackerjack Northwestern University journalism students concluded he could not have been the killer -- and got someone else, Alstory Simon, to confess on videotape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Illinois, Porter was the 10th person released from death row since 1977, when the death penalty was reinstated. Florida leads the nation with 18 such cases since 1973. Common sense -- not to mention the laws of probability -- suggest that innocent people have been executed and will be executed. It cannot be that every mistake is uncovered or every police frame-up revealed. Deep down, we all know that -- and know further that the assertion by death penalty proponents that the system is mistake-proof is wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet this is a price we are willing to pay -- those of us, that is, who delude ourselves into thinking that the death penalty deters crime. We will put up with the inevitable execution of an innocent person so that the rest of us are somehow made to feel safer. Similarly, we will countenance a certain amount of police brutality if (1) it's someone else who's getting bopped on the head and (2) we feel it contributes to making the streets safer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How Chinese of us.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman stood outside the tiny vestibule on Wheeler Avenue in the Bronx where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been killed in an astonishing barrage of gunfire unleashed by four undercover cops. A cold wind was blowing down the quiet street. Candles flickered on the floor of the unlocked vestibule. Flowers had also been placed on the floor. The woman made the sign of the cross and then wiped tears from her face. But she couldn't stop crying. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was standing a few feet away with a notebook and a pen. The woman turned to me, still wiping her eyes, and said, &quot;For the first time in my life I feel hatred.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, at a rally in Foley Square in lower Manhattan, a brokerage house employee named Gordon Andrews said: &quot;They are killing us and nobody is hearing us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawyer from Brooklyn who stood on the steps of the state Supreme Court building to watch the rally told me: &quot;There's a storm brewing, and it's a big one. People are fed up. I'm fed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know if Mayor Rudolph Giuliani realizes it, but there are limits to the amount of abuse that black New Yorkers will accept from violent and racist police officers. And those limits are fast approaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black New Yorkers are in a fury over the cold-blooded killing of Diallo. His death is seen by most blacks as simply the latest tragic manifestation of the ruthless and humiliating treatment of ethnic minorities that is part of the daily routine of so many cops in this city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apologists for the Police Department can try to sugar-coat it if they like. Yes, it's true that crime has dropped precipitously. Yes, it's true that most cops are solid citizens. But it is also true that there is a frightening number of violent, racist, sadistic and in some cases homicidal police officers who spend much of their time terrorizing people. And that behavior is widely seen by black New Yorkers as being tolerated if not condoned by Giuliani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How gruesome has the situation become? Some parents and civic leaders are teaching black and Hispanic children to quickly display their hands during any encounter with police, like little criminals. This is to show that the youngsters are not armed and therefore should not be blown into eternity at age 10 or 15 or 20 by a trigger-happy stranger in a blue uniform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been a long epidemic of outrages -- killings, the torturing of Abner Louima, the invasions by rampaging cops of the apartments of innocent families, the routine beating and harassment of young men and boys, the curses and the racial slurs, the arrests on phony charges of individuals who dare to object to abusive treatment, and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last summer the mayor ordered an entire section of Harlem locked down because he objected to a rally that was being held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a widespread feeling among black New Yorkers that they are living in a police state, and that many of the cops are a threat to the very lives oftheir children. The anger and resentment are growing by the day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's getting to be not much of a stretch to suggest that if the New York City police recreated the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre (thousands of French Protestants killed), Mayor Rudolph Giuliani would point out that most cops do a good job, the Rev. Al Sharpton would lead a demonstration down to City Hall and the vast majority of New Yorkers would, as they have in recent times, yawn in indifference. It is well-known that for crime to remain low, the cops have to be able to do their thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their most recent thing here involved a West African immigrant named </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 22, who was mowed down -- this was literally the case -- in the Bronx last week. Four policemen from the storied Street Crimes Unit fired an incredible 41 bullets at him, of which 19 hit their mark.

Florida leads the nation with 18 such cases since 1973. Common sense -- not to mention the laws of probability -- suggest that innocent people have been executed and will be executed. It cannot be that every mistake is uncovered or every police frame-up revealed. Deep down, we all know that -- and know further that the assertion by death penalty proponents that the system is mistake-proof is either a lie or the blathering of a moron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet this is a price we are willing to pay -- those of us, that is, who delude ourselves into thinking that the death penalty deters crime. We will put up with the inevitable execution of an innocent person so that the rest of us are somehow made to feel safer. Similarly, we will countenance a certain amount of police brutality if (1) it's someone else who's getting bopped on the head, and (2) we feel it contributes to making the streets safer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How Chinese of us! How shortsighted, too. After all, killers need not be executed. They can be kept in jail where they will harm no one and, if eventually exonerated, still be able to enjoy freedom. As for police brutality, it is not only unnecessary. It demeans us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alleged station house torture in Brooklyn of an Abner Louima, the persistent rise in complaints against the NYPD, the excessively high rate of shootings by Washington's Metropolitan Police, the incredible enthusiasm for capital punishment -- all these suggest not that the authorities are out of control but that they are doing precisely what we want. We have reversed Voltaire's venerable dictum: On the streets or on death row, it is better to risk that an innocent man will die than for a single guilty one to walk free.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The people of New York, writes Cameron Stewart, are weighing up the human cost of a safer society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EACH night in New York City, small groups of heavily armed plain-clothes policemen drive through the city's toughest neighbourhoods in old, unmarked cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They call themselves the Street Crimes Unit -men who have spearheaded New York's highly successful assault on violent crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their motto, &quot;We own the night&quot;, reflects the confidence, some say arrogance, of the 422 officers chosen for this special unit on the basis of the high level of arrests early in their careers. New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani credits this group above all others for making New York safer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that was cold comfort for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a 22-year-old West African immigrant, who had no police record and spoke with a stutter, as he stood outside an apartment building in the Bronx late one night last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diallo, who friends describe as a friendly, gentle man, had returned to his home at midnight after finishing work as a street vendor in Manhattan. He was standing outside his apartment building in the Bronx when a car carrying four members of the unit pulled up alongside him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four plainclothes officers, all white, stepped out and approached the black Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What occurred then is unclear. But within seconds all four policemen opened fire on the young man, firing 41 shots at him and killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two of the officers emptied their weapons, firing 16 shots each. It turned out that Diallo was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A rally in the Bronx yesterday highlighted growing concern across the country at the methods of the unit, which aims to seek out or stop crime before it happens. Now the US Justice Department has taken the unusual step of launching an investigation into Diallo's death in an effort to defuse the potentially explosive incident, which is already being compared with the case of Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant tortured in a Brooklyn police station in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diallo's death has sparked outrage in New York, especially among African Americans. It has been condemned by Amnesty International and has renewed debate about the need to curb the aggressive mode of policing in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accusations that New York police -pumped up by their success in combating crime -have become trigger-happy came as it was disclosed that three of the four unit members who killed Diallo had been involved in other shootings, one still under investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(This was) the worst form of police brutality we have ever seen or heard of,&quot; said black activist Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was not a police murder, this was a police slaughter.&quot;&nbsp; A lawyer for the four policemen, Stephen Worth, has suggested the police may have shot Diallo after he failed to respond to their orders. He said Diallo gestured with his hands, leading the police to think he was reaching for a gun. And at the time of the shooting the policemen were searching for a serial rapist in the area and Diallo was acting suspiciously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He is acting strange, he fits the rapist's description in a generic way,&quot; the New York Times quoted Mr Worth as saying. &quot;Despite repeated identifications and orders to this individual to do certain things, he failed to comply.&quot;&nbsp; But one police official told the Times, &quot;It looks like one guy (policeman) may have panicked and the rest followed suit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK: In a matter of seconds, four white police officers from the elite Street Crime Unit fired 41 shots at an unarmed man, a black West African immigrant who had no police record and spoke with a stutter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a street peddler described as religious and hard-working, was hit 19 times and died instantly in the vestibule of his apartment building in the Bronx on Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers' lawyer said Mr Diallo gestured with his hands, leading the police to think he was reaching for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the officers the only witnesses, Amnesty International and the NAACP are demanding explanations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US Attorney Mary Jo White said federal prosecutors are reviewing the case for possible civil rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plainclothes police who shot Mr Diallo had been looking for a rape-murder suspect when they encountered the 22-year-old immigrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are some similarities between this individual and the sketch we have,&quot; the police commissioner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the police fired 16 bullets each, emptying their 9mm, semi-automatic pistols in less than five seconds. The others fired their pistols four and five times.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heartbroken mom of an unarmed immigrant blown away by cops collapsed and cried out for justice yesterday when she saw the bullet-riddled building where he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm hurt! I'm hurt!&quot; Kadiadou Diallo wailed, her knees buckling beneath her outside the brick rowhouse in The Bronx where her son, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, lived and died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice must be done,&quot; she said after a 30-minute visit to his apartment in the Soundview section. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flown to New York from the West African nation of Guinea, the dead man's mother first prayed with friends and family at a Parkchester apartment complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm suffering, I'm in deep sorrow,&quot; she said as she left for the Wheeler Avenue death scene with a police escort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pain was etched on her face and she gasped for air as she slowly stepped from a black van outside the two-story building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Amadou, Amadou,&quot; Mrs. Diallo sobbed after falling to the ground a few feet from the vestibule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends, who also began to weep, pulled her up and helped her through the doorway where her son was killed in a hail of gunfire last Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She passed walls pockmarked by the 41 bullets fired by four plainclothes cops who claim they mistakenly thought Diallo was reaching for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She stepped around a growing mound of flowers left by friends and neighbors shocked that a man with no gun and no criminal record could be shot dead by police in his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the apartment, she went into the room where her 24-year-old son would return after long days of peddling hats and gloves on 14th Street in Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first thing she did when she came into the apartment was to ask where he slept and she lay down on his bed,&quot; said the slain man's roommate, Abdul Diallo, who is not related to the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said she wants to die instead of him,&quot; said a family friend who was also with her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visit was brief, as were the mother's remarks when she left the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her son was &quot;a good boy, well educated, from a good family,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;I'm still crying. I am still in sorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to see justice for my son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family lawyer Kyle Watters pleaded for privacy for Mrs. Diallo, saying she needs time and space to mourn her son, who arrived in the United States two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her husband, who was on a business trip in Vietnam when he got word of his son's death, is expected to arrive in New York tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family, which is considering an independent autopsy, is planning a traditional Muslim ceremony Friday before bringing Amadou's body home for burial in Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Giuliani cancelled his plans to spend tomorrow night and Friday in Texas with Gov. George W. Bush in order to attend the service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before and after Mrs. Diallo's visit to her son's home, neighborhood residents continued to stop by to leave bouquets, candles and letters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't know him, but this just gives me a headache,&quot; said Sharon Brown, who lingered outside the vestibule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was one person. To get shot for no reason ... it's not fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 2,000 protesters converged on lower Manhattan yesterday to call for a federal takeover of the probe into the police shooting of a West African immigrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We come to the federal government to say, 'This must stop,'&quot; the Rev. Al Sharpton thundered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally at Federal Plaza came as the FBI monitored the Bronx district attorney's probe of the slaying, going so far as to sit in on interviews with civilian witnesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feds have not officially opened an investigation of the Feb. 4 shooting, and agents have not been allowed to watch interviews of police personnel, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators - the NYPD estimated a crowd of 1,200 but there appeared to be more than 2,000 - called for the feds to formally intervene in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now there is much ado about the city showing sympathy to the family. That is appropriate,&quot; Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we don't just want sympathy, we want justice. We can't have real peace until there's justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four officers who fired 41 bullets at street vendor </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss Jr. and Richard Murphy - have been placed on desk duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many at the 2-hour demonstration demanded the cops be charged swiftly with Amadou's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I loved my nephew very deeply and I will miss him daily,&quot; said the slain man's uncle, Mamadou Diallo. &quot;My sadness is great with the knowledge that the four people who shot him are still walking freely on the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Bronx grand jury could take up the case this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Worth, the cops' lawyer, said they are willing to testify as long as the feds don't take over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the rally, protesters chanted, &quot;no justice, no peace,&quot; and accused Mayor Giuliani of turning a blind eye to police brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These cops wouldn't have done this if they didn't think they could get away with it,&quot; said Terry Denson of The Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think this is the last time we're going to see this. The police are getting more aggressive, dangerously aggressive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators joined a growing chorus of criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields and former Mayor Ed Koch plan to hold a news conference today to demand that the NYPD emphasize civil rights with the &quot;same passion&quot; as crime-fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koch said he believes cops are entitled to the presumption they acted professionally - unless there are facts to the contrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is inconceivable that 41 bullets would have to be fired at a guy who it turns out doesn't have a gun, doesn't have a criminal record. And at this point we don't know why they did it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this point, I have drawn a conclusion that the burden is on the cops to show they conducted themselves professionally. Common sense tells me at this point that they did not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Black and Hispanic Caucus of the City Council also is planning a news conference on a bill to name a street after cop-chokehold victim Anthony Baez, commemorating all victims of police brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Giuliani has defended the NYPD as being the &quot;most restrained&quot; big-city police department in the nation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE woman named Passion was easy to spot in the crowd protesting the shooting death of an unarmed immigrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She walked faster, more intensely, than the others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was small in stature, but the no-frills placard she carried that read, &quot;Another Isolated Incident,&quot; seemed to stand out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She used both arms to carry the sign as high as she could - as if a young thug had a gun pointed to her back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't even tear up this sign anymore. I just wait for another incident to occur,&quot; said Passion, a 40-year-old Harlem playwright, whose arms remained stuck in place like the Tin Man in &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's happening too much ... and that worries me because I'm a mother of a 19-year-old,&quot; she said, her extended arms refusing to flinch as she pushed the sign skyward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the more than 2,000 protesters gathered in Foley Square to denounce the police shooting of 24-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, hundreds were women - like Passion - who felt compelled to join in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were from different neighborhoods and socio-economic backgrounds. But these black mothers seemed to share one common phobia - their children may accidentally get shot by cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo was gunned down in a hail of bullets because he didn't turn into an ice cube when four cops screamed, &quot;Freeze.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was dead by the time the cops realized he wasn't a criminal - and wasn't carrying anything more threatening than a beeper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some mothers came from home. Others joined in during their lunch break or running an errand in lower Manhattan. Most are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All are scared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm 64 years old and I'm getting tired of being out here,&quot; said Dana, a retired city worker. &quot;But I have to be here because the next one could be my son ... I worry about my son, my nephews - they all fit the profile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol Taylor, 67, of Brooklyn, who was carrying a sign that read, &quot;Oh God Cops Keep Killing Our Children,&quot; is angry and fearful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are all scared stiff,&quot; she said, raising her voice. &quot;Every time my son goes out the door, I worry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this phobia an aberration or do black and Latino mothers have a legitimate reason to be scared?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are white cops - who make up the majority of the police force - likely keep their fingers closer to the trigger when approaching minorities?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked three cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black Cop: &quot;Most cops defer and use more discretion when dealing with a white perp ... You never hear about a cop shooting a unarmed white man by accident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White Cop: &quot;It doesn't make a difference, I approach everyone with apprehension and fear, whether they are black, white or Hispanic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanic Cop: &quot;I don't care what the perp's race is - my main concern is safety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Department records show there were 111 incidents in which cops fired at &quot;offenders&quot; last year. The department said it couldn't provide The Post ethnic breakdowns of the shooters and the citizens being shot at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without the stats, it's hard to say for sure if these black and Latino mothers have a legitimate fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I'm left asking the question: Can anyone remember the last time an unarmed white man in this city was shot by cops because he acted in a &quot;threatening manner&quot;?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theodore Kaczynski, imprisoned as the Unabomber, believes he was unfairly forced to plead guilty last year and plans to seek a new trial, a law professor who has corresponded with him said on Tuesday. Michael Mello of Vermont Law School said in an interview that Kaczynski has objected in letters to the circumstances that led to his guilty plea last January. His lawyers portrayed him as mentally ill, and the judge in the case denied him permission to represent himself. Mello said he had received 58 letters from Kaczynski, who has been in federal prison in Florence, Colo., since he was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole last spring. Kaczynski's desire for a new trial and his correspondence with Mello were described in an article in the Feb. 15 issue of The National Law Journal. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Grounded cargo ship leaks oil onto Oregon beaches</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cracks widened in the steel hull of a grounded cargo ship Tuesday, pouring thousands of gallons of oil and diesel fuel onto environmentally sensitive beaches near Coos Bay, Ore. Streaks of tar-like fuel oil streaked the southern Oregon coastline for six miles around the 639-foot New Carissa. As many as 300 workers were called in to mop up the mess with shovels, squeegees and absorbent pompoms.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Church leader takes stand in his racketeering trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after prosecutors rested their case Tuesday against the Rev. Henry Lyons, the National Baptist Convention USA leader briefly took the witness stand in the Largo, Fla., courtroom. Judge Susan Schaeffer wanted to hear from Lyons about a 1995 letter offering a list of the church organization's purported 8.5 million members to a magazine publisher for $ 50,000. Prosecutors had wanted to admit the letter as evidence in his racketeering trial. When asked by prosecutors whether such a list even existed at that time, he hesitated and then responded: &quot;Just trying to get my dates together. . . . I don't believe so.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>January's tornadoes more than triple month's record</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month was a record-setter for tornadoes in the United States. The 163 twisters on record were the most in any January, the National Weather Service said Tuesday. More tornadoes occurred Jan. 21 - 87 - than on any previous January day on record. &quot;Frankly, we consider this to be a significant number of tornadoes for a March day - the height of tornado season. These numbers in January are unprecedented,&quot; said Joe Schaefer, director of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Okla. In all, 141 tornadoes struck Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee in that outbreak, the agency said. More twisters ripped through six other states earlier in January. The total of 163 is more than three times as many as the previous monthly record for January of 52 tornadoes set in 1975, Schaefer said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Law aims to block Atlanta's suit against gun makers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After heavy lobbying by the National Rifle Association, Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes on Tuesday signed a bill blocking Atlanta's liability lawsuit against gun manufacturers. The law, which takes effect immediately, makes Georgia the first state to prevent a city or county from filing product liability suits against gun makers. The law reserves that right for the state. Barnes, a Democrat, said the state has the right to force Atlanta to avoid the costs of pursuing its lawsuit. Atlanta filed its suit against 17 gun makers last week. As with similar cases in Chicago, New Orleans, Bridgeport, Conn., and Miami, Atlanta accused the industry of negligently designing guns with inadequate safety devices and sought reimbursement for the costs of gun-related violence. The city plans to move forward with its lawsuit and see how the court responds, Mayor Bill Campbell said through a spokesman.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Reagan image can't fit on Mount Rushmore, agency says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Ronald Reagan may have an airport and a federal building named after him, but he will not be immortalized on South Dakota's Mount Rushmore, the National Park Service said Tuesday. The agency, which manages the monument, said there is no place within 100 feet on either side of the massive stone faces to carve another image. &quot;It's not about Reagan,&quot; but about carving more faces, said spokesman David Barna. The rock on the mountain in South Dakota's Black Hills is too fragile to support more blasting for further carvings, he said. Earlier this month, Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said he would introduce legislation to add Reagan's likeness to the shrine alongside other former Presidents G eorge Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Holbrooke will pay ethics fine; nomination moves ahead</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bill Clinton moved ahead with plans to nominate Richard Holbrooke to be ambassador to the United Nations after Holbrooke agreed Tuesday to pay $ 5,000 to settle civil charges that he violated federal ethics laws. Holbrook, 57, denied the Justice Department's allegations that he improperly contacted a U.S. diplomat on behalf of his employer. Instead, Holbrooke said he was acting as a special government employee asked to explain U.S. policy to Asian officials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fourth officer, Sean Carroll - who allegedly fired 16 of the 41 shots - called in sick, a department spokesman said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four had been on leave since Thursday, when they opened fire on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a street peddler they had come to interview about a serial rape case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo, 22, a Guinea native, was gunned down in his Wheeler Avenue doorway - struck by 19 of the bullets fired from the officers' guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers say they opened fire after Amadou disobeyed or misunderstood an order to freeze, and instead reached for his pockets, where he kept only a pager and wallet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward McMellon, 26, Kenneth Boss Jr., 27, Richard Murphy, 26, and Carroll, 35, have been allowed to keep their guns, but they're reassigned to administrative duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Bronx grand jury may begin hearing testimony in the shooting today, to determine if the four will face criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses will include roommates and relatives of Amadou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not clear if the cops will testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, their lawyer said only that he may let them testify without immunity, providing federal prosecutors not intervene until after The Bronx grand jury completes its deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outraged protesters have gathered by the hundreds to decry the brutal shooting, with another rally scheduled for today in front of the federal courthouse in Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting was serious enough to attract the attention of federal prosecutors, who are monitoring the Bronx probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White stressed that she has &quot;complete confidence&quot; in the Bronx effort.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At moments of high passion, facts are often overtaken by feelings. It's a natural human reaction, but it's no excuse for jumping to politicized conclusions. After four NYPD officers shot and killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Thursday, those who have been arguing that the police department is unnecessarily brutal seemed to have the upper hand, and 1,000 people gathered on Sunday to second that emotion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's simply not borne out by the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York, the rate of fatal police shootings - 0.48 per 1,000 cops in 1998 - is the lowest it's been since 1985. That's lower than the rate in Chicago, Dallas, Miami, Philadelphia or Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nineteen civilians were killed by the NYPD in 1998, compared with 20 the year before and 30 in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, police shootings of all kinds have been going down during the Giuliani administration crime crackdown. In 1995, for example, there were 344 police shootings, with an average of five rounds fired per incident. Last year, the incidents dropped to 249, with an average of 3.4 shots fired per incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's happened even as arrests have026 . 0000.00soared from 309,587 in 1995 to 403,659 in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the Street Crime Unit (SCU), the elite group to which the four officers involved in Thursday's incident belonged? Again the numbers don't support the idea of a bunch of out-of-control cowboys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1997 and 1998, for example, the SCU stopped and frisked a remarkable 45,000 people. It captured 2,072 guns, about 40 percent of all the guns seized citywide. In that time, SCU cops fired their own guns in 28 incidents and killed three people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the killings were found to have been justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, the overwhelming bulk of NYPD cops who fire their weapons in The Bronx do so only at paper targets at the police department firing range, not at innocent civilians on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to discount the seriousness of the Diallo killing. If the four officers involved in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> acted criminally, they should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if they genuinely believed their lives to be endangered, and the shooting was the result of a tragic misunderstanding, then they should not be railroaded. 026 . 0000.00 00000</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia has decided to bar Queen Elizabeth from opening the 2000 Sydney Olympics but has yet to inform her. A ''unanimous'' cabinet decision favoured the games being opened by Prime Minister John Howard. However, given the delicate state of the Crown's position in Australia, royal aides are anxious to play down any suggestion of a rift. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States: Octuplets' dad avoids jail for assault</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father of the Houston octuplets pleaded no contest yesterday to assaulting his mother-in-law and avoided jail in a deal that will remove the charge from his record if he stays out of trouble. Iyke Louis Udobi, 41, and his family did not comment after leaving the courtroom. Mr. Udobi received two years deferred adjudication, which is similar to probation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States: 'Mercy' killing unnecessary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An elderly Nebraska man who fatally shot his 74- year-old wife to save her from what he thought was terminal cancer was told in court yesterday that autopsy results found no trace of cancer. Vernal (Bob) Ohlrich, 76, who pleaded no contest yesterday to manslaughter, said doctors told him the cancer had spread from his wife's colon to lymph nodes. ''I was told by doctors that she should call her children home because she's not going to make it overnight,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States: Probe sought in shooting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International and the NAACP are demanding explanations, and federal prosecutors are reviewing the shooting last week of a black street pedlar by four white police officers from New York City's elite ''Street Crime Unit,'' whose motto is ''We Own the Night.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 22, a street pedlar described as religious and hard-working West African immigrant with no criminal record, was hit 19 times and died instantly Thursday in the vestibule of his apartment building in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe: Pressure mounts in Kosovo talks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British and French foreign secretaries return to the Yugoslavia-Kosovo peace talks today to put more pressure on the participants to sign a treaty. Although the talks are being held in private, observers indicate the position of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians is apparently causing difficulties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa: Eritrea claims major victory</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eritrean forces claimed to have dealt the Ethiopian army a heavy blow on a new front yesterday, inflicting casualties and forcing thousands of soldiers to retreat.  Ethiopian officials, meanwhile, admitted jet fighters were being used to support a counter-offensive. Fighting over the weekend ended an eight-month stalemate in the war between the two Horn of Africa countries over their unmarked border.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York City last week, four police officers fired 41 shots<BR>at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in an apartment vestibule, hitting him 19 times<BR>and killing him where he stood. In Riverside, Calif., last December,<BR>four police officers fired 24 shots at Tyisha Miller in a locked<BR>car, hitting her 12 times and killing her where she sat.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is there a pattern in these and similar cases that warrants close<BR>examination? Almost certainly.<BR>&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- In both cases, the victims were black while the officers were<BR>white.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- In both cases, the shots were excessive.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- In both cases, the reservoir of good will between law enforcement<BR>and inner-city residents has been drained lower.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumably, the officers felt threatened. New York police were<BR>interviewing Diallo in the middle of the night in an especially<BR>dangerous section of the Bronx. In Riverside, reports suggest<BR>that Miller had a firearm on her lap and that she reached toward<BR>it when officers tried to break the car window.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's not really good enough. Regardless of what the New<BR>York officers thought, Diallo was unarmed when they killed him.<BR>And Miller was apparently passed out in her locked car. She awakened<BR>to the jolting sounds of someone trying to break in on her.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers should indeed take the steps necessary to keep themselves<BR>safe. But when the confrontation is four to one, it takes a lot<BR>to explain why the incident rises to the level of gunplay in the<BR>first place.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, there's little evidence to support the insinuations by<BR>community activists that the killings have racial motivations.<BR>Yet it almost doesn't matter. The hard truth is that police-community<BR>relations are defined by the worst instances and that the worst<BR>instances are often defined not by the number of shots fired,<BR>but by the decision to fire at all.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe it is inevitable that front-line police officers will react<BR>as a unit to any perceived threat. But it is also inevitable that<BR>as long as their training invites exaggerated fusillades against<BR>even marginal threats, the infectious rupture of public trust<BR>that characterizes so many inner-city and minority neighborhoods<BR>will continue to fester and weep.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A comet-chasing spacecraft named Stardust rocketed away from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Sunday on a seven-year, 3 billion-mile quest to bring back precious comet dust. Stardust began its formidable journey one day late, soaring into a clear afternoon sky aboard a Boeing Delta rocket. A last-minute radar problem Saturday caused the delay. NASA's Stardust mission is the first attempt to gather material from beyond the moon and return it to Earth. It is also the first time NASA has sent a robot on an extraterrestrial pickup-and-delivery mission. The last time the agency went after samples in outer space was with the 1972 Apollo 17 mission, the last of the manned lunar landings. Alleged killer gives up after inmate freed A Milwaukee man surrendered Sunday to Chicago police on charges he killed two people in a slaying for which another man was sentenced to death. The state attorney's office, having reviewed a videotaped of an alleged confession by Alstory Simon, issued warrants for both him and his estranged wife, Inez Jackson. Anthony Porter, originally imprisoned for the slayings, spent his first weekend of freedom in 17 years. Porter had been scheduled to die in September, but his appeal was granted two days before the lethal injection. <BR> Microsoft shake-up may be in the works Microsoft Corp. plans to reorganize the No. 1 software maker into four groups and bring back a top programming wizard, who led the development of Windows 95 and the Internet Explorer browser, according to a report published today and an analyst familiar with the plans. News of the reorganization, one of the most sweeping shake-ups in Microsoft's history, could come as early as this week, the Seattle Times reported. The Times said Brad Silverberg, 44, a former Microsoft executive now on leave, will be invited back to head the newly formed consumer group. Silverberg and Microsoft officials weren't immediately available to comment.<BR> Rally decries killing of immigrant by police About 1,000 people rallied in New York on Sunday outside the home of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a West African immigrant who died when police fired 41 shots at him. The U.S. Attorney's Office has begun investigating the case, and a grand jury convened by the Bronx district attorney is expected to begin reviewing evidence today. Diallo, 22, who immigrated from Guinea two years ago and worked as a street vendor, died in the vestibule of the building where he lived after being hit 19 times by bullets from four officers early Thursday.<BR> Diet alone may cut blood pressure A study indicates that high blood pressure can be lowered significantly with a healthy diet and without the need for hypertension medication, particularly among blacks. &quot;We are talking about a diet with the potential of preventing and treating hypertension and doing it particularly well in people at risk,&quot; said Dr. Laura Svetkey, associate professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., and lead author of the study. The study is published in today's edition of the Archives of Internal Medicine.<BR> Avalanche kills 1 of 4 trapped near Lake Tahoe An avalanche in California caught four friends and buried them for hours, killing one. The entire Lake Tahoe area has been socked by a series of powerful storms that have dumped almost 2 feet of snow and created blizzard conditions with winds gusting to 100 mph. Many ski resorts in the Sierra Nevada had to close down because of the storms. The avalanche occurred Saturday, trapping the four for six hours.<BR> 5 teens found OK after Idaho blizzard Five teenage boys who spent the night lost on a northern Idaho ski resort that was raked by a snowstorm were safe Sunday after three found their way home and two brothers were spotted by snowmobilers. Rescuers said the brothers, ages 13 and 15, appeared to be all right.<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'How many trips down darkened alleys does a young cop need to take, ... how many grotesquely bloodied innocent victims of random crime does he need to pack into ambulances, before he begins to wonder far too much about what fate has in store for him?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PITY the constable, from whom an imperfect city demands perfection. And pity Rudy Giuliani; he needs a friend right now, but he may have used them all up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the cops. They need friends, too. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death last week of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, shot 19 times by police in a dingy Bronx rooming house, shocks the conscience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somewhat less fearsome - but no less worrisome - was the narrow escape last month of a rap singer who came under police fire in Brooklyn for no apparent good reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is the NYPD out of control?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More to the point, does either event rise to the level of a crime?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are not unreasonable questions; so far, the answer seems to be no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, Diallo appears to have been a straight arrow. A legal immigrant, hard-working and with no criminal record or suspect associates, he regularly sent money to relatives in Guinea and was apparently saving to attend college here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Diallo did to attract the attention of four plainclothes street-crime cops remains a mystery. What it was that triggered the 41-shot fusillade that killed him is even less clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somewhat more ambiguous is the case of the Brooklyn rapper. Police say that he was in an erratically driven car in Brooklyn on Jan. 15 - and that when they tried to pull him over, he fired two shots at them. They fired back; happily for the rapper, they missed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem with the police account of events - which was rejected by a grand jury - is that there is no evidence to support it: No gun, no spent shell casings (save their own), no nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except a bit of irony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rap, as a genre, is meant to do explicit violence to civility. And it is no accident that among the more successful rap acts are those which blatantly bait cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mostly, this is harmless stuff. Adolescent suburbanites, usually white, love socially corrosive rap - because it horrifies their parents so - and they're the principal market for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, they're not likely to shoot cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such music is more problematic in the inner city, where the social contract is a fragile document to begin with - and where white, suburban-raised cops harboring profound suspicions of the people they police can be found in all-too-arrogant abundance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This makes for a bitter broth, and it has been simmering far too long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a practical matter, though, the cops' suspicions aren't unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD doesn't often come into contact with upright citizens - elite street-crime cops least of all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They know how bitterly they're resented - which is ironic as well, because as bad as conditions can be in high-crime neighorhoods, they would be intolerable without a strong police presence. (When muggers prowl, folks don't call Calvin Butts, now do they?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too much can be made - and too often is - of the risks attending police work. But there are too many New York City cops in the ground to lightly dismiss the dangers of the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many trips down darkened alleys does a young cop need to take; how many muttered threats does he need to hear; how many hi-tech handguns does he need to strip from criminals; how many grotesquely wounded innocent victims of random acts of violence does he need to pack into ambulances before he begins to wonder - far too much - about what fate has in store for him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some cops can't take it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some cops, there comes a night in a cramped vestibule in The Bronx when the safety slips too easily off his own handgun - and shots are fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murder? A crime of any kind?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a determination to be made by Bronx DA Bob Johnson - a fellow whose antipathy to the death penalty shouldn't obscure the fact that his integrity and competence deserve far more respect than is being accorded by the U.S. Justice Department, in its eagerness to insinuate itself into the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities won't be lacking for advice in the days and weeks just ahead, but they need to maintain perspective. Some cases seem clear-cut - the Abner Louima matter springs to mind - but most aren't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DA, and the feds, must set the bar very high. Should they succeed in criminalizing horrific judgment - or, perhaps, simple panic - they will do more than just compound injustice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will certify the base assertion that city cops - by implication, all city cops - are natural born killers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who prospers with this notion in circulation? Not the cops; but they won't be hurt either - they'll simply go into on-duty hibernation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, the criminals will win - and drug dealers in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As always, law-abiding New Yorkers will be the real losers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani stands to lose, too - particularly if he doesn't move quickly to correct the obvious training and command breakdowns that underlie these shootings. The legitimacy of his splendid mayoralty is at grave risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has few allies these days, and so he may be reluctant to do what has to be done to establish accountability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, just as there is no room for rump justice here, neither is a cover-up of any sort acceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One more thing: New York City is safer today than it has been in more than three decades - and, in the end, the credit for this goes to Giuliani's uncompromising law-and-order sensibilities, and to the NYPD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This counts for a lot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angry protesters led by the Rev. Al Sharpton crowded into a Bronx neighborhood yesterday to decry the fatal police shooting of a West African immigrant and demand the cops face criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1,000 people - chanting, carrying signs and demanding justice - jammed the block in front of 1157 Wheeler Ave., where four officers killed an unarmed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a hail of 41 bullets Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no justification for the slaughter of this young man. We want the world to know that we are going to fight for justice,&quot; Sharpton told the crowd after leading them in an opening chant of &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We call for the immediate arrest of these four policemen,&quot; Sharpton said to cheers and applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two 6-foot-high photos of Diallo - emblazoned with the words, &quot;An innocent man of integrity massacred by police brutality&quot; - hung on buildings behind the speakers, who included Assemblyman Ruben Diaz (D-Bronx) and Iris Baez, mother of cop choke-hold victim Anthony Baez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was murder,&quot; Baez said. &quot;We have to stay together. We have to say, 'No more.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cold, wet snow began to fall at the start of the two-hour afternoon rally, but the crowd - which was diverse but made up primarily of Africans and African-Americans from The Bronx - held fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many carried homemade signs saying, &quot;Stop Killer Police,&quot; &quot;Cops Have Blood on their Hands&quot; and &quot;KKK Rules NYPD.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friction with police erupted at one end of the rally when cops arrived to arrest a neighborhood man on an unrelated dispute. But Sharpton urged the crowd to keep calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters booed loudly every time speakers mentioned Mayor Giuliani or Police Commissioner Howard Safir, and people in the crowd spontaneously called out for the death penalty for the officers who shot Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a damn dirty shame!&quot; one man shouted repeatedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another protest is planned for tomorrow in front of the federal courthouse in downtown Manhattan, and a funeral service for Diallo, 22, will be held Friday at the 96th Street mosque, Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcry over the New York killing of an unarmed West African immigrant in a fusillade of 41 police bullets spread to the national stage on Sunday, as the president of the NAACP condemned the shooting as &quot;excessive force at its worst&quot; and urged U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to reassure Americans that such incidents will not be tolerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kweisi Mfume said he would ask Reno today to make a public statement that &quot;the Justice Department will use every possible vehicle to get to the facts involved in the case and make sure that justice is fair and swift.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mfume's comments were the first indication that national attention is beginning to focus on the death Thursday of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diallo, a 22-year-old street peddler with no criminal record, was hit by 19 of the 41 bullets fired by four police officers in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 1,000 people staged an angry rally Sunday in front of the apartment building, chanting &quot;no justice, no peace&quot; and saying the time may have come to &quot;fight back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening statements are today in the court-martial of Marine Capt.<BR>Richard Ashby, charged in the deaths of 20 people when his jet<BR>snapped a gondola car cable over the Italian village of Cavalese<BR>a year ago.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-two Italians who say they saw Ashby's jet flying too low<BR>and too fast over the village are expected to be the first witnesses<BR>before a jury of officers at Camp Lejeune, N.C.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 21 relatives of victims are coming at the U.S. government's<BR>expense to watch the trial. There are a few seats in the small<BR>courtroom for relatives; a video feed with translators has been<BR>set up in another building.<BR>&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was at the controls of the<BR>EA-6B Prowler jet on Feb. 3, 1998. The North Carolina-based crew<BR>had been assigned to the Aviano, Italy, air base for flights over<BR>Bosnia.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A military investigation blamed the tragedy on reckless flying.<BR>But defense lawyers say Ashby didn't know the cable was strung<BR>across the valley until seconds before hitting it. Ashby faces<BR>a maximum possible sentence of more than 200 years in prison if<BR>convicted on all charges.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOLOCAUST TALKS: The World Jewish Congress was weighing<BR>possible sanctions against Deutsche Bank and preparing for today's<BR>meeting in Washington with the chairman of Germany's biggest bank<BR>to try to resolve Holocaust claims. Last year, Deutsche Bank announced<BR>a $ 10.1 billion takeover of Bankers Trust as part of an ambitious<BR>expansion drive, but the deal was hamstrung by charges Deutsche<BR>Bank's affiliates used slave labor during World War II. Deutsche<BR>Bank denies using slave laborers, though last week its historian<BR>said the bank helped pay for construction of the Auschwitz death<BR>camp. The WJC wants the bank to make &quot;material reparations&quot;<BR>to Holocaust survivors and heirs.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHOOTING PROTEST: About 1,000 people rallied outside the<BR>New York home of a West African immigrant who died when police<BR>fired 41 shots at him. Four officers looking for a rapist shot<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 22, a street peddler from Guinea, Thursday. Officials<BR>say the officers thought Diallo had a gun, but no gun was found.<BR>The U.S. Attorney's office has begun a probe, and a grand jury<BR>convened by the Bronx prosecutor is expected to begin reviewing<BR>evidence today.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NASA launches pursuit of comet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comet-chasing spacecraft Stardust rocketed away from Cape<BR>Canaveral on a seven-year, 3 billion-mile quest for precious comet<BR>dust.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NASA's Stardust mission is the first attempt to gather material<BR>from beyond the moon and return it to Earth. It also is the first<BR>time NASA has sent a robot on an extraterrestrial pickup and delivery<BR>mission. The last time the agency went after samples in outer<BR>space was Apollo 17 in 1972, the last of the manned lunar landings.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The launch, aboard a Boeing Delta rocket, came one day after a<BR>last-minute radar problem forced a delay Saturday. Stardust is<BR>to meet up with Comet Wild-2 in January 2004, passing within about<BR>90 miles of the 2 1/2-mile-diameter iceball.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists hope that tiny comet fragments, no bigger than a grain<BR>of salt, will be trapped by a pop-up collector that's covered<BR>with transparent ultralight glass foam called aerogel. The most<BR>vulnerable parts of the 850-pound spacecraft, about the size of<BR>a large refrigerator, are shielded to protect against the swirl<BR>of particles.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surveying the vestibule of the two-story Bronx apartment building where Diallo, 24, was shot by cops, the public can observe the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*A side wall scarred by about 10 bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Two wooden doors leading into the red brick building marked by about eight bullet holes or dents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*The lower part of the inside door panel shattered to bits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Bullet scars on the hallway ceiling, walls, the first step of the stairs leading to the second floor and the wall just above the door of Diallo's first-floor apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simply put, the hard-working, criminally clean immigrant from West Africa never had a chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The barrage of gunfire appears to have been so concentrated a large cockroach probably would've been caught in the cross-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Diallo's friends, neighbors and probably the general law-abiding public wants to know is: Why did four Street Crime Unit cops need 41 bullets to take down an unarmed man?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I condemn this massacre - I'm sorry, but that's the way it looks,&quot; said George Correia, 45, of the United Force, a political party from Diallo's homeland of Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four cops - Edward McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy - confronted Diallo at 12:43 a.m. just as he was about to walk out of his building at 1157 Wheeler St.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing outside, the cops began shooting through the 3-foot-wide building entrance after Diallo acted in a suspicious manner, their union lawyer has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the cops were justified for using deadly force is debatable and best left up to investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fairness to the cops - who haven't spoken to investigators - I'm told a quick trigger finger could empty a 9mm. semiautomatic handgun, which carries 16 bullets, in four seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What may disturb some folks, however, is that 19 bullets struck Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means 22 bullets went crashing helter-skelter throughout the building's first floor, possibly endangering other lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All I know it could've been anybody,&quot; said Diallo's visibly shaken next- door neighbor, Kemrajie Bassit, thinking about her 24-year-old son getting caught in the crossfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mamadou A. Diallo, 31, a cousin of the dead man, said he trusts the justice system, but in light of the mistake and number of bullets fired he &quot;definitely&quot; wants the officers tested for drugs and alcohol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the department does not test for either after a deadly shooting, said Detective Walter Burnes, an NYPD spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subway motormen involved in fatal incidents are tested for drugs and alcohol. Maybe the Police Department should consider such a policy to allay the concerns of Kathleen Celestine, 47, who also can't understand why so many shots were fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first thing that came to my mind when I heard about it was they [the cops] must've been high.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And like a chorus, five of the eight people standing outside Diallo's bullet-scarred building said, &quot;I thought so, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of chicken burritos made by a division of Tyson Foods Inc., have been recalled because of listeria, a potentially deadly bacteria. The recall affects some 78,000 burritos supplied to American Airlines at the end of last year, according to the Detroit Free Press. The subsidiary supplies food for airlines and makes foods for restaurants. It ships about 50 million meals a year, the paper said Saturday. Listeria was found in burritos sampled in Detroit, the paper said. When ingested, the bacteria c an cause a disease called listeriosis that starts out resembling intestinal flu but can lead to death. Listeriosis primarily affects fetuses, the very young, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. Healthy people are not normally sickened by it. Other recent food product recalls include hot dogs and deli meats made by Bil Mar Foods, a unit of Sara Lee Corp. A nationwide outbreak of listeria was linked to Bil-Mar's Zeeland, Mich., plant. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>GOP vows to save Social Security and not cut benefits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Saturday that Republicans were committed to saving the Social Security system without cutting retirement benefits. In the weekly Republican radio address, Ryan announced that he would introduce legislation next week seeking to guarantee existing benefit levels to all Social Security recipients. &quot;We in Congress are absolutely committed that, no matter what other reforms need to be made to make the program solvent in the future, there will be no change in benefits to current or soon-to-be retirees,&quot; Ryan said. &quot;The House leadership has pledged to move swiftly on this important measure in the next few weeks because we want Americans of all ages to know exactly where we stand.&quot; President Bill Clinton already is seeking to set aside 62 percent of the federal budget surplus - expected to total $ 2.41 trillion over the next decade - to shore up the Social Security system. tt1 Republicans support using most of the surpluses for Social Security. But House and Senate Republican leaders insist that budget surpluses would provide enough cash for Social Security and for income tax cuts of at least 10 percent.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Police shooting of immigrant will be investigated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department and New York prosecutors say they will investigate the death of an immigrant from Guinea. The victim was killed in a police shooting. Four officers fired 41 shots at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 22, who was struck 19 times in the vestibule of his Bronx home, according to the medical examiner's report. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said Friday that her office would investigate the case along with the Bronx district attorney's office. Relatives and friends encouraged federal officials to review the shooting, which they called an execution. &quot;This was not a police murder; it was a police slaughter,&quot; said the Rev. Al Sharpton. &quot;If a man was put in front of a firing squad, he would not expect to be shot at 41 times.&quot; Some have suggested race was a possible factor for the shooting on Thursday. Diallo was black and the four officers are white. ma Police Commissioner Howard Safir said officials still don't know exactly what happened because there were no civilian witnesses and investigators have not talked to the officers yet. The Bronx's district attorney has asked police not to interview the officers until their investigation is completed. &quot;They took what they felt to be, and feel to be, appropriate police action,&quot; said the officers' lawyer, Stephen Worth. lots<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Five are killed when private plane crashes after takeoff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A private plane crashed shortly after takeoff from the Ozona, Texas, airport Saturday, killing all five people aboard, officials reported. Wreckage of the plane, identified as a Cessna 182, was found Saturday morning on a pasture near the airport in southwest Texas. The victims were three adults and two children, said the Department of Public Safety's spokesman, Mike Cox, in Austin. All were dead at the scene. He said the victims were related, but he gave no identities. The plane had been reported missing after it took off about 9 p.m. Friday, according to Cox.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Geologist finds earthquake fault near San Francisco</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A geologist has discovered an earthquake fault in the seaside cliffs just south of San Francisco. The fault, though unknown until recently, has been around for a long time. It's not clear if it is active, geologist Scott Kieffer said last week. Kieffer was mapping the Mussel Rock area of Daly City last fall when he roped down the side of a cliff to examine layers of sedimentary rock and found clear evidence of a quake across a previously unmapped fault. He dated the sedimentary layer around the rupture to 120,000 years ago, which means the state Division of Mines and Geology would classify it as inactive. But the fault would be considered active if it has generated a quake as recently as 11,000 years ago, and would require urgent work to survey its seismic danger.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Overturning of rapist's sentence upsets prosecutor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A prosecutor in Cincinnati said Saturday that he was appalled by an appeals court decision to overturn a prison sentence for a child rapist because the judge had quoted from the Bible when imposing the punishment. In a 2-1 verdict, the Ohio 1st District Court of Appeals reversed on Friday a 51-year sentence for James Arnett, 33. He had pleaded guilty a year ago to 10 counts of rape involving the 8-year-old daughter of his fiancee. Hamilton County Prosecutor Mike Allen said, &quot;For 200 years in this country, judges have been invoking Scripture in the courtroom. I think this reversal of sentence is total nonsense.&quot; In its majority opinion, the appeals court said Judge Melba Marsh clearly was influenced in her sentencing by a passage from the Bible. She, therefore, denied the defendant his right to due process by violating the guarantee of separation of church and state, the ruling said. &quot;By factoring in religion, the court is acting outside of Ohio's sentencing guidelines, as well as violating the offender's due process rights,&quot; Judge Mark Painter wrote in his majority opinion. Marsh said in the courtroom that she had used the Bible as &quot;an additional source of help&quot; in determining the severity of the sentence. Allen said he would try to make sure Arnett stayed in prison until the case goes back to Marsh's court for a new sentence. He likely will appeal the decision to the Ohio Supreme Court, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An alarm scrubbed the launching of NASA's Stardust spacecraft Saturday in Cape Canaveral, Fla., less than two minutes before it was to blast off on a seven-year odyssey to snatch dust from a distant comet. Launch managers had the narrowest of windows - just one second - in which to ignite its rocket and boost the phone-booth size, 848-pound robotic spacecraft on its way to a meeting with Comet Wild-2. The alarm indicated a momentary dip in current to a radar beacon used to track the spacecraft.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE killing of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has hit a raw nerve with New Yorkers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four cops against one man. Forty-one shots fired. He's unarmed. Not a suspect in a crime. No criminal record. Outside his Bronx apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of where you sit on the police spectrum, the shooting by Street Crime Unit cops is as disturbing as allegations cops sodomized Abner Louima with a stick in a precinct bathroom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Honest friends of the NYPD woke up yesterday concerned about how cops could kill a man who had just come home from a day's work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the best of New York's Finest have been jarred by the tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's f---in' horrible,&quot; one of the brightest police officials said of a worst-case scenario that provides a radioactive bomb for critics, wherever they stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks as bad as you can make it look,&quot; another official, a former Street Crime Unit supervisor, sadly acknowledged. &quot;It polarizes people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes the incident &quot;will become one of those critical points in New York policing.&quot; And in a lot of ways, it should.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the rabble-rousers, who are calling the shooting an outright &quot;execution,&quot; are ignoring reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reasonable officials remain open-minded about the real truths that occur during heart-pumping moments when cops, sent out to confront the city's worst criminals, are forced to make split-second decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you've seen the movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; you can understand the tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the NYPD's vaunted Street Crime Unit show up for work willing to risk their lives in neighborhoods with the highest crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherever they are deployed, crime drops precipitously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unit's track record speaks for itself - great restraint, huge arrest numbers, disproportionate seizures of weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are heavily supervised. Rarely fire weapons. And several of their Finest, such as Kevin Gillespie, have made the ultimate sacrifice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they remain human - and the very high-risk nature of their work is ripe for tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's just not supposed to be tragic for some guy standing innocently outside his home after a long day's work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have more questions here than answers,&quot; the ex-SCU boss said. &quot;But questions are easy. It's the answers that are difficult and the solutions even harder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could race have been a factor? The cops are white, Diallo black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think so. We take guns from bad guys, whether they are white, black, green or purple,&quot; the ex-SCU boss said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Were the cops - from a unit that proudly proclaims &quot;We Own the Night&quot; - overly aggressive?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have never seen that,&quot; the boss said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the tragedy expose a flaw in police tactics?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is hard for me to understand what was in their minds until there are answers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of years ago, several anti-crime cops in Brooklyn shot and killed a man in a stolen car who they thought was reaching for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no gun, but the man was wanted for murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton led marches. But the grand jury did not indict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Yorkers also must understand that this is not another Abner Louima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting in The Bronx occurred, tragically, in the course of real police work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one set out to hurt that man that night,&quot; the top cop said. &quot;I do not like what happened Thursday morning, but it is not allegedly brutalizing someone in a bathroom, which was criminality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a tactical problem,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Giuliani struck the right tone yesterday, saying: &quot;I understand the feelings of frustration and fear and anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I also think it shameful that people exploit or implicate the entire Police Department,&quot; Giuliani said, appealing for people to await Bronx DA Robert Johnson's investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line remains that the NYPD has to find out how this happened - and find a way to prevent it from happening again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops who blew away unarmed immigrant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a rain of 41 bullets want his family to know they &quot;feel terrible&quot; about the tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They want to send their personal condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Diallo,&quot; James Savage, acting head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cops feel terrible,&quot; Savage said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers - Sean Carroll, 35; Edward McMellon, 26; Kenneth Boss, 27; and Richard Murphy, 26 - gathered for a meeting with their lawyer in Long Island yesterday before going their separate ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those seen in public were dealing with their shredded emotions in different ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Carroll used his fists to grind the tears from his eyes as he left his Long Island home - a day after emptying his gun into the 24-year-old Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry, but under the circumstances, I can't talk now,&quot; Carroll, 35, sobbed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please leave my family alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savage's account of the four cops' feelings was more direct than the version offered by their lawyer, Stephen Worth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On a human level, these officers are sorry that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> died,&quot; Worth said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, they feel that they took appropriate police action under the circumstances. It may well develop that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had a language barrier which prevented him from following the officers' orders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Murphy said nothing as he hurried away from his Fresh Meadows, Queens home early in the day with his wife and 3-month-old boy in tow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Murphys put their new baby into his car seat in an old sedan parked on the street, then climbed in and sped away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A neighbor who asked not to be named said Murphy moved into the neighborhood 18 months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was so excited about the birth of his baby three months ago,&quot; said the neighbor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a beautiful baby boy and he was very proud of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Murphys' two-story, brick row house on a grassy circle in the planned community sat silent the rest of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbor Joe Rivetti said Murphy is normally a calm and friendly person, respected in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He always stops to say hello to the old people on the block and make sure they're all right,&quot; Rivetti said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My son wants to be a cop and Richard was very helpful giving him pointers about joining the auxiliary police and the cadet force,&quot; Rivetti said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one answered the door at the yellow Kings Park, L.I., home of Officer Boss - but someone called Suffolk County cops to chase away reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The green-shuttered Cape Cod-style home surrounded by a white picket fence gazes out on the waters of Long Island Sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbor Arnold Discorsi, 63, tried to make sense of the tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unbelievable that he would shoot an unarmed man,&quot; Discorsi said, speculating that Diallo, from Guinea in West Africa, might have misunderstood cops' commands or made a sudden move that brought on the gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe they were shooting for a good reason, even if it was an accident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Babylon, L.I., a neighbor said Carroll has lived in the same, two-story, gold-colored house his whole life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a block party every year and he organizes it,&quot; Linda Gugliuzzo said. &quot;I can't tell you anything but nice things about the guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carroll is married with one son and one daughter who attends art classes with Gugliuzzo's granddaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large white and blue boat was up on concrete blocks in the driveway of the Carroll home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean Carroll could not hold back the tears as he apologized to a reporter for not being able to say any more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have an appointment,&quot; he choked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're very nice people,&quot; Lee Levitt said. &quot;They're very fine people. Basically they keep to themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMellon worked in the 75th Precinct prior to his assignment to the Street Crime Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A supervisor at the 75th described McMellon as an active cop who made numerous gun arrests in East New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pending the investigation of the shooting, the four officers have been removed from street patrols and given administrative assignments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 24, was hit by 19 of the 41 bullets fired by four plainclothes police officers early Thursday in the well-lit vestibule of his Bronx apartment building, the city medical examiner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internal affairs investigators working with the Bronx district attorney's office combed the area around 1157 Wheeler St. in what sources said has been a fruitless search for a civilian witness to the shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have found three witnesses to events either before or after the shooting, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said her office will work closely with the office of Bronx D.A. Robert Johnson to look for possible civil-rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four officers who fired the shots are white; Diallo is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A prayer vigil and rally was slated for 2 p.m. tomorrow outside the victim's home and supporters plan to march Tuesday in front of White's office to urge federal involvement in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We just want these people to face the music and pay the price for what they did,&quot; said Diallo's cousin, Modousalieu Jallovv, who flew in from Detroit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He worked hard to take care of his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo's father, a businessman working in Vietnam, plans to accompany his son's body home Feb. 13 to Lelouma, a small village in Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers who shot Diallo, Sean Carroll, 35, Edward McMellon, 26, Kenneth Boss, 27, and Richard Murphy 26, had not yet been questioned by investigators yesterday, but they met with lawyer Stephen Worth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source familiar with their accounts of the shooting said they were patrolling the Soundview section of The Bronx because a livery cab driver had been robbed and murdered there earlier in the week. Earlier reports indicated they were looking for a murderous serial rapist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They spotted Diallo walking in and out of his building, got out of their car and ordered him to freeze, the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo moved his hands toward his belt area, possibly removing something from his pocket and beginning to lift it, the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came the bullets - 41 of them in just a few seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole tragedy - from the time cops got out of their car until the last bullet flew - lasted less than 2 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo was found dead, a wallet and a beeper beside him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Giuliani called the Guinean consul to the United Nations, promising to keep him informed, and dispatched a community-assistance unit to help the dead man's relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're very concerned about the number of shots, but we have no facts yet from which anyone can draw a conclusion,&quot; Giuliani said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators interviewed 13 cops today who worked the neighborhood after the shooting - seven from the Street Crime Unit and six from the 43rd precinct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials and activists sought answers yesterday in the killing Thursday of an unarmed West African immigrant by police, who fired 41 bullets at him as he stood in the narrow vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dead man, Amadou &quot;Ahmed&quot; Diallo, 22, had no criminal record and was widely praised by neighbors, family and friends yesterday as a devout Muslim who neither smoked nor drank, and who peddled hats, gloves and scarves on 14th Street in lower Manhattan so he could send money to his family in Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers have not yet been questioned, but Mayor Rudolph Giuliani asked for patience while an investigation by Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson goes forward. &quot;We all have to wait and react to the facts,&quot; the mayor said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo &quot;was a good man who prayed, worked, and enjoyed the company of his friends,&quot; Alpha Balde, 38, a neighbor who knew him from Africa, said. &quot;He wanted to go to school to learn computers, and he never got the chance. They broke his life. We're all shocked about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Balde spoke outside the now-bullet-scarred door of 1157 Wheeler Ave., a two-story brick rowhouse on a tidy street reminiscent of some of the economically sturdier blocks of Olney or Logan in Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the door and inside the vestibule, marked and labeled, was evidence of more than two dozen bullet holes. A small candle flickered in the corner where Diallo's head had rested; a single red rose had been stuck in the cracks between the exposed brick, where bullets had shattered a plaster wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the apartment house, bullet holes marred the ceiling and staircase in the hall. There were dried drops of blood on the first-floor carpet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An autopsy released yesterday found that Diallo had been hit by 19 bullets: 11 in the legs, 5 in the torso, and 1 each in the back, right arm and chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The key issue here is the number of bullets,&quot; said Norman Siegel of the New York Civil Liberties Association, who served on a police-brutality task force empaneled in 1997 after the alleged beating and torture by police of Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant. &quot;What circumstances would justify 41, even if the suspect had a weapon?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police rules on the use of lethal force are clear: Officers may fire when they or their partners have reason to fear for their lives or the lives of others. They are to hold fire once a target has been disabled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Sidique Wai, who heads an organization of African immigrants to the United States, called for a federal investigation of the New York Police Department. As he spoke in front of the shooting site, he was joined by Inez and Ramon Baez, whose son, Anthony, was choked to death by an officer in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International called the killing of Diallo &quot;distressing.&quot; And black activist Al Sharpton has begun organizing a rally to be held at the site tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four officers involved in the shooting were part of a plainclothes street-crime squad that has been credited citywide with collecting about 40 percent of the illegal handguns seized by police over the past several years. The unit had been assigned to look for a serial rapist in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, critics of the police department, including representatives from a group of African American officers, said the street-crime unit had been allowed to be too aggressive on patrol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm troubled because there appears to be a comfort level on the part of Mayor Giuliani and the police commissioner with very aggressive tactics, all in the name of getting guns off the street, and it makes incidents like this inevitable,&quot; said Lt. Eric Adams, an officer assigned to the 94th Precinct in Brooklyn who is president of One Hundred Blacks in Law Enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams said that he went to the scene of the shooting yesterday to express his outrage. &quot;The entire city should be upset,&quot; he said. &quot;When you look inside this cramped, narrow hallway, you wonder how four cops got in here, and how they could shoot off so many rounds. It's a miracle they didn't kill each other, and others asleep in the building.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers' attorney, Stephen Worth, said that the shooting was explainable and not racist violence. &quot;They took what they felt to be - and feel to be - appropriate police action,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it will likely develop that Mr. Diallo had a language barrier, which prevented him from understanding and complying with the officers' orders, and made him continue to act in an aggressive manner toward the police officers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbors yesterday recalled how they heard what sounded like machine-gun fire coming from the entry of the modest apartment in the middle of the block early Thursday. &quot;It's something we don't ever hear or see,&quot; Jimmy Graham, 48, who has lived there for 24 years, said. &quot;This is a block of hard working, lawful people; we never have problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four officers involved in the shooting - Edward McMellon, 26, Sean Carroll, 35, Kenneth Boss, 27, and Richard Murphy, 26, were equipped with 9-mm semiautomatic pistols, which hold 16 bullets and can be completely emptied within four seconds. They have all been placed on administrative duty while the investigation continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMellon, Carroll and Boss have been involved in other shootings in the past two years. McMellon and Carroll were found to have acted properly, police said. Boss remains under investigation for an Oct. 31, 1997, shooting in Brooklyn. According to the Civilian Complaint Review Board, McMellon was the subject of five complaints, while Carroll and Boss have each received three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of yesterday, none of the four officers had been interviewed, because police-union procedures afford officers a 48-hour &quot;cooling off&quot; period during which they can refuse to be questioned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unarmed West African immigrant with no criminal record was killed early Thursday morning by four New York City police officers who fired 41 shots at him in the doorway of his Bronx apartment building, police said. It was unclear Thursday why the officers had opened fire on the man in the vestibule of his building in the Bronx. The man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 22, who came to America two years ago from Guinea and worked as a street peddler in Manhattan, died at the scene, police said. Pluto will remain in solar big league It's official: Pluto is still a planet, and mere mortals won't change that any time soon. The ruling by the world's leading astronomical organization came amid a brewing cosmic storm among scientists and stargazers, afraid that the smallest planet in the solar system was being demoted. News reports had said Pluto was to be demoted to a Minor Planet, or --- worse --- a Trans-Neptunian Object. That simply isn't so, the Paris-based International Astronomical Union said Thursday.<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four veteran cops from an elite anti-crime unit blasted 41 bullets at an unarmed Bronx man yesterday - insisting later they thought the young African immigrant was reaching for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 12:44 a.m. slaying of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 24, stunned both the tight-knit Guinean community in Soundview and police brass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next to Diallo's bullet-riddled body - which may have been struck as many as 22 times - cops found only a beeper and a wallet with some money inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a tragedy from every perspective,&quot; one police official said. &quot;Maybe the guy made a move. Maybe he thought he was gonna get robbed. Either way, there's a lot of shooting. It's one of those tragedies.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends of the slain man, an immigrant from Guinea who sold gloves and hats on the streets of Manhattan, said they would meet today to begin raising funds to send his body home to Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is so sad, my whole body shakes,&quot; said Saidou Diallo, 33, who is not related but comes from the same village in Guinea in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm trying not to be angry - I can't even be angry, because it's just so sad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Giuliani said it might be two or three days before facts of the case are clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Be patient,&quot; he urged Soundview residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all have to wait and react to facts. We've had terrible mistakes in this city when people have reacted to rumors and intuition and feelings. Let's let the process take its course and react to facts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to investigators, four Street Crime Unit officers - Richard Murphy, 26, Sean Carroll, 35, Edward McMellon, 26, and Kenneth Boss, 27 - were searching for the killer Bronx Rapist, a suspect who has committed 36 rapes, robberies and at least one murder since August 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials concede there was no call to Diallo's apartment building on Wheeler Avenue around midnight yesterday - and that address wasn't the location of any previous attacks by the alleged rapist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened next is unclear, since no witnesses came forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor noted that the officers involved do not have to speak, based on a union provision called the &quot;48-Hour Rule,&quot; which gives cops in a possible brutality case two days before they have to talk to investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Diallo family lawyer, Kyle Watters, said the young immigrant, who came to the United States 2 years ago, had come home after a 12-hour work day and then left to pick something up at a nearby store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he returned, he was confronted by the four cops. But it isn't clear what, if anything, was said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources who know the cops say the four thought Diallo was reaching for a weapon in his waistband - though no gun was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They feel terrible about this,&quot; one source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carroll and McMellon emptied their 9mm semiautomatic pistols - 16 rounds apiece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murphy fired four times, and Boss shot five times, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All you could see was gunsmoke in the air,&quot; said across-the-street neighbor Nilsa Ortiz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had nothing that could be construed as a gun,&quot; Watters said. &quot;He was doing nothing suspicious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roommate Abdo Rahman Diallo, who is not related, said he was awoken by cops who demanded he come and identify Diallo's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't hear anything, but then the police knocked on the door,&quot; he said. &quot;They said, 'Come with us.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police said to me, 'Do you know this guy? I said, 'Yes, we live together.' I was scared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo's body was taken to Jacobi Hospital, and he will be buried in his native country, said his uncle, Mamadou Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He died of multiple gunshot wounds to the torso, said Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office. The medical examiner was still determining how many bullets hit Diallo and the direction they were fired from. The information was expected by today. Sources said they believe the young man was hit 22 times.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends say he died the American Nightmare - wrongly cut down by overzealous cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He came here for a better life,&quot; said Diallo's uncle, Mamadou Diallo, 38. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was so excited to come here. He hoped to help his family get here one day because the life in America here is so good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a 24-year-old native of Leloume, a village in Guinea, West Africa, had been living for the past year with two roommates in a cramped apartment in a tight-knit Bronx community of his countrymen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he worked grueling, 12-hour days as a street vendor, peddling gloves and hats on 14th Street in Manhattan, there were signs Diallo was finding his way in the new culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And loving it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poster of movie star Leonardo DiCaprio adorned one wall of the small three-room apartment on Wheeler Street in the Soundview section that he shared with his roommates. The young men traded tapes of their favorite music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uncle recalled how an ambitious Diallo arrived in the United States 2 years ago, with barely more than his dreams and youthful energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a while, Diallo, a devout Muslim who didn't smoke, drink or take drugs, stayed with his uncle in Soundview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was never a problem, never a problem,&quot; the uncle said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo was quiet, some friends said, because a stammer made speaking difficult at times. He would stamp his foot in exasperation - almost as if the gesture would force the words to come, said a friend, Cellou Diallo, 24, who is no relation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though he didn't talk too much, he'd walk across the street just to say hello,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Amadou wasn't working, he loved to listen to Alpha Blondy, a reggae singer, play soccer or attend a local mosque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a good worker and very law-abiding,&quot; said his uncle, who last spoke to his nephew when both went to their mosque to pray at the end of the holy month of Ramadan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Diallo's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> friends and relatives struggled with the nightmarish end to the young man's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo, who was unarmed, was killed when cops fired 41 bullets at him in the hallway of his apartment building, apparently believing he was reaching for a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need an explanation,&quot; said family friend Demba Sanyang, 39.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like a tragic mistake on the part of the police. I am very angry. The police had no reason to shoot someone [so many times]. It's outrageous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kyle Watters, who will represent the Diallo family and who also represents the Guinean Association of America, said the victim's relatives &quot;want justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not right that he gets sent back to his country in a wooden box,&quot; Watters said. &quot;He was looking for a better life, not a shorter one.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman stood outside the tiny vestibule on Wheeler Avenue in the Bronx where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been killed in an astonishing barrage of gunfire unleashed by four undercover cops. A cold wind was blowing down the quiet street. Candles flickered on the floor of the unlocked vestibule. Flowers had also been placed on the floor. The woman made the sign of the cross and then wiped tears from her face. But she couldn't stop crying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was standing a few feet away with a notebook and a pen. The woman turned to me, still wiping her eyes, and said, &quot;For the first time in my life I feel hatred.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, at a rally in Foley Square in lower Manhattan, a brokerage house employee named Gordon Andrews said: &quot;This expletive has got to stop. They are killing us and nobody is hearing us.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A lawyer from Brooklyn who stood on the steps of the State Supreme Court Building to watch the rally told me: &quot;There's a storm brewing, and it's a big one. People are fed up. I'm fed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know if Mayor Rudolph Giuliani realizes it, but there are limits to the amount of abuse that black New Yorkers will accept from violent and racist police officers. And those limits are fast approaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black New Yorkers are in a fury over the cold-blooded killing of Mr. Diallo. His death is seen by most blacks as simply the latest tragic manifestation of the ruthless and humiliating treatment of ethnic minorities that is part of the daily routine of so many cops in this city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apologists for the Police Department can try to sugar-coat it if they like. Yes, it's true that crime has dropped precipitously. Yes, it's true that most cops are solid citizens. But it is also true that there is a frightening number of violent, racist, sadistic and in some cases homicidal police officers who spend much of their time terrorizing people. And that behavior is widely seen by black New Yorkers as being tolerated if not condoned by Mayor Giuliani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How gruesome has the situation become? Some parents and civic leaders are teaching black and Hispanic children to quickly display their hands during any encounter with the police, like little criminals. This is to show that the youngsters are not armed and therefore should not be blown into eternity at age 10 or 15 or 20 by a trigger-happy stranger in a blue uniform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been a long epidemic of outrages -- killings, the torturing of Abner Louima, the invasions by rampaging cops of the apartments of innocent families, the routine beating and harassment of young men and boys, the curses and the racial slurs, the arrests on phony charges of individuals who dare to object to abusive treatment, and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last summer the Mayor ordered an entire section of Harlem locked down because he objected to a rally that was being held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a widespread feeling among black New Yorkers that they are living in a police state, and that many of the cops are a threat to the very lives of their children. The anger and resentment over this is growing by the day. And increasingly the resentment is being directed not just toward the police and the Mayor but toward white New Yorkers in general, who are not subjected to the same levels of brutality and harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am scared to death,&quot; said a former city official, who asked not to be identified, &quot;that this division between blacks and whites, this schism, is growing so large that it can't be repaired. African-Americans perceive that the white community largely condones Rudy's policies as they relate to the blacks and the police. And therefore the whites are as much to blame as Rudy and the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't believe that most white New Yorkers condone police misconduct, but there have not been nearly enough white voices raised against the atrocities committed by the police. This unfortunate silence is, indeed, a form of encouragement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops who killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have had several days now to craft their story. The Mayor and the Police Commissioner are doing their public-relations thing, offering condolences, ordering meaningless training, waiting for the press to turn its attention elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, black New Yorkers are seething. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As other elected officials criticized the killing of an unarmed immigrant by four police officers, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended the Police Department yesterday with a fresh batch of statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Giuliani used graphs to show that city police officers fired 856 shots in 1998, down from 1,040 shots in 1997. The number of fatal shootings by police officers last year -- 19 -- was the lowest since 1985, a &quot;remarkable&quot; fact given that arrests have risen dramatically, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statistics were part of the Mayor's Management Report, a self-evaluation that the City Charter requires to be published every six months. Its presentation came as public protest persisted about the fatal shooting of the West African immigrant, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mr. Giuliani said little yesterday about the shooting, he spent an unusual amount of time on police statistics before moving on to other parts of the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor said that the police in Boston, Washington and Chicago fire their weapons more frequently than officers in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the impressions that's given by those who have a hard time giving the police credit for anything is that safety in the city is brought about by the Police Department becoming more violent,&quot; he said. &quot;Just the opposite is the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all the news about the Police Department was good: the police are taking longer to respond to calls about crimes in progress, especially in Brooklyn, the report said. The average citywide response time was 10.5 minutes, up from 10 minutes in 1997. In Brooklyn, the average response time rose to 10.9 minutes, from 10.1 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an area where the Police Department has to do more work, to find out why, and how that can be reduced,&quot; Mr. Giuliani said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, prepared by Mr. Giuliani's staff, trumpets an increase in city bus ridership, a decrease in potholes, an increase in graffiti-related arrests and a decrease in reported cases of tuberculosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 107 civilians died in fires last year, the smallest number in 52 years, according to the report. From July through October, the average response time for the Fire Department was 4 minutes and 16 seconds, down from 4 minutes and 20 seconds for those same months in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a less auspicious note, the city paid its employees $205 million in overtime from July through October, compared with $170 million during that period in 1997. Caseloads for probation officers increased to an average of 239, from 209. And the number of children waiting for subsidized day care slots increased to 13,261, from 12,031.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important not to lose sight of the fact that there still remains plenty of work to be done,&quot; said Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of the City Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report suggested that Mr. Giuliani's civility campaign had not necessarily rubbed off on taxi drivers, who were the target of one of his quality-of-life crackdowns last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taxi and Limousine Commission received 4,247 complaints about drivers from July through October, up from 3,608 during those months in 1997. Complaints almost doubled in the category of &quot;abusive behavior by driver,&quot; to 643 from 319. Complaints in the category of &quot;physical abuse by driver&quot; also increased, as did complaints about traffic infractions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Giuliani said the increase in complaints might be due to his highly publicized crackdown on reckless cabbies, suggesting that it had made riders more aware that cabdrivers must be held accountable. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the greatest accomplishment of the Giuliani administration is the precipitous drop in the city's crime rate, its most glaring shortcoming may be the failure to cultivate a trusting relationship with most of the city's black leaders. Now, the best and the worst have melded into the Diallo case, presenting Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani again with a delicate matter of race relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anger persists over last week's shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an unarmed African immigrant, by four white police officers who riddled his body and apartment-building vestibule with 41 bullets. On Monday, the president of the N.A.A.C.P. attracted national notice by condemning the shooting. On Tuesday, more than 1,000 people staged a heated demonstration in lower Manhattan, with many suggesting that Mr. Giuliani's crackdown on crime had made targets out of all young black men. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And yesterday, Mr. Diallo's mother heeded the advice of the Rev. Al Sharpton and curtly rejected any assistance from the Mayor while in the city to retrieve her son's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With every passing day, Mr. Giuliani struggles to bring a calmer perspective to the tragedy, to convey convincingly the pain he says he feels over this loss of life and compassion for the victim's family. Several times he has imparted heartfelt thoughts, then felt the need to defensively recite statistics showing that fatal police shootings are less frequent in New York than in other large cities. His recitation of statistics seems to linger longer than his words of sympathy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are several reasons for the Mayor's predicament, including his decision to reserve most comment during the investigation of the shooting. But the overriding factor, critics say, is rooted in the earliest days of Mr. Giuliani's tenure: unlike his predecessors, the Mayor never established a lasting rapport with many of the city's black leaders, either personally or through emissaries. That failure, coupled with various slights and arguments along the way, now leaves him with no capital of trust from which to draw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the clear message at a news conference convened yesterday by C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan Borough President, and attended by, among others, former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who had troubles of his own with many black political and civic leaders. But rather than score the Mayor, most of the speakers pleaded with him to open the lines of communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being Mayor &quot;requires a willingness to hear,&quot; Mr. Koch said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we're saying to the Mayor: 'Listen.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Fields agreed. &quot;I certainly am not blaming Mayor Giuliani or Commissioner Safir for the tragedy that took place,&quot; she said, referring to Police Commissioner Howard Safir. Nevertheless, she said that the city &quot;must change the tone and move in a different direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Giuliani responded last night by impeaching the event's credibility, noting that Mr. Koch is a persistent critic and saying that Ms. Fields failed to acknowledge the Police Department's accomplishments, including reduced crime in black neighborhoods. He maintained that he has working relationships with other black leaders -- citing Congressman Charles B. Rangel and former Congressman Floyd Flake -- and tends not to deal with &quot;highly partisan Democrats&quot; who he said strive for headlines rather than for substance. &quot;If you hold a press conference and attack me, attack the Police Department and completely discredit everything that's been done, and if you have somebody who is a persistent critic sitting next to you,&quot; the Mayor said, it suggests &quot;no real willingness to work out a real solution. That happens in politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, the Mayor said that he understood the frustration. &quot;I can understand the anger,&quot; he said. &quot;I can understand all of it and I feel terrible that this happened as I have expressed on numerous occasions.&quot; But he said &quot;that there's a tendency of some people in our society to blame the police in broad strokes that is just as vicious a prejudice as any other prejudice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, from a purely political perspective, the Mayor -- who harbors hopes of seeking higher office -- may take comfort in remembering that the electorate has twice validated his management style. In fact, he received more votes from black residents in 1997 than he did when first elected in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discussing Mr. Giuliani's relations with minority communities, his aides rattle off a series of accomplishments -- from crime reduction to job growth -- that they say have improved the lives of everyone in the city, and offered a familiar and short roster of ministers, business owners and neighborhood leaders who are both black and willing to talk of their admiration for the Mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this gambit backfired. One of them, the Rev. Michel Faulkner, said yesterday that he met with Mr. Giuliani this week to convey the emotion that the Diallo case has sparked in black neighborhoods, and to suggest that the administration more emphatically display empathy for communities jarred by the shooting. But the minister said he left that meeting feeling frustrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In terms of where we go from here, I really would hope the Mayor would understand the amount of tremendous pain that communities of color are in over this incident,&quot; Mr. Faulkner said. &quot;If he does not, I really think this will be a permanent blight on his administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the moment he took office in 1994, Mr. Giuliani's relationship with various black leaders has been complicated, even dysfunctional..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Mayor's first actions was to end the practice of his predecessors of having liaisons to the many constituencies in the city, from gay men and lesbians to Hispanics and blacks. &quot;He didn't want to balkanize the city,&quot; said his press secretary, Colleen Roche. State Senator David Paterson and City Councilman Bill Perkins, among others, contend that the decision, in fact, balkanized neighborhoods like Harlem, leaving them with no access to City Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the center of the tension is the Police Department, whose members have given the Mayor something to brag about -- crime reduction -- even as they resent him for blocking their requests for pay increases. There is the perception that the department's get-tough policy has been largely directed at young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the very ones who are being singled out are the ones who are being saved&quot; by the crackdown on crime,&quot; said Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia University. &quot;If you look at just who's alive and who's dead, it's saving the lives of black men. The people who were getting killed were never white women or old white guys or even black women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a very complicated issue,&quot; he added. &quot;It's a terrible situation when people fear government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Symbolizing that fear of government was the Louima case of 1997, in which a Haitian immigrant was brutalized inside the station house of a Brooklyn precinct. Mr. Giuliani immediately called for a task force to explore community-police relations. But months after his re-election, he ridiculed some of that task force's recommendations with sarcasm that overshadowed the fact that he had set aside $15 million for sensitivity training for officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sarcasm, along with memories of the administration's aggressive handling of the Million Youth March in Harlem last summer, returned to haunt Mr. Giuliani when Mr. Diallo, who was unarmed, was killed. His private meetings with African emissaries, his offers of assistance to the Diallo family, his words of solace -- even his statistical representation of having improved black neighborhoods as much as any other in the city -- wind up appearing to some as insincere somehow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor's challenge, according to Dr. James Forbes, the pastor of Riverside Church in Harlem, is to better convey a universal message: &quot;Guess what -- you all count.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mother of an African street peddler, whose killing by four police officers has led to angry protests over the human cost of aggressive police behavior, has refused an offer of financial help from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton said yesterday that Kadiadou Diallo, whose son Amadou was killed last week, while unarmed, in a barrage of 41 bullets in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building, declined the Mayor's offer because she and her husband preferred to accept aid from relatives and other African immigrants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I hate to blow the Mayor's bubble here, but they are not preoccupied with the Mayor,&quot; said Mr. Sharpton, who has taken a highly visible role in protests over the shooting. &quot;They are preoccupied with how they are going to deal with political injustice and how they are going to bury someone who shouldn't be being buried.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the victim's mother turned down the city's help in transporting her son's body home to Guinea, a number of prominent current and former city officials criticized the Mayor and the Police Department for what they termed an inadequate and insensitive response to a shooting that remains unexplained. The four police officers, part of an elite street crime unit that patrols at night, have not yet been questioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manhattan Borough President, C. Virginia Fields, convened a news conference that was attended by Edward I. Koch, the former Mayor, and several other community leaders. Calling for a change of tone by the Mayor and the Police Department, Ms. Fields said city officials should create an atmosphere of respect after explosive incidents like the Diallo shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, David N. Dinkins, Mr. Giuliani's predecessor as Mayor, said the Mayor's reaction to the shooting was &quot;woefully inadequate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This business of, the police always are entitled to the benefit of the doubt, should not operate in every circumstance,&quot; Mr. Dinkins said. &quot;Clearly, the facts of this put the burden on the cops to come forward and explain. The Mayor should be asking that question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, Kweisi Mfume, president of the N.A.A.C.P., joined those who said the Federal Government had been too passive in letting the Bronx District Attorney direct the investigation. Mr. Mfume spoke of his &quot;utter dismay&quot; at the Justice Department's decision to monitor the investigation, rather than initiate one of its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor told reporters yesterday that while he understood the anger and frustration in the city and felt &quot;terrible&quot; about the shooting, he felt that it would not be fair to draw any &quot;systemic conclusions&quot; from the incident. He also said that &quot;there is a tendency of some people in our society to blame the police in broad strokes that is just as vicious a prejudice as any other prejudice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saikou Diallo, the victim's father, said last night after arriving at Kennedy International Airport from Hong Kong that he hoped the four policemen who shot his son would be arrested and &quot;judged fairly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope, yes, to get justice in America,&quot; said Mr. Diallo, who was in Vietnam on business when his son was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor's office sent people to pick up Mr. Diallo at the airport, but he chose to leave there with Mr. Sharpton and Kyle Watters, a lawyer representing the family. Later, after stopping at a friend's apartment, Mr. Diallo visited the building at 1157 Wheeler Avenue where his son was killed, and spent about 10 minutes inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early yesterday, Mrs. Diallo moved out of the Stanhope Hotel, where the city had offered to pay her hotel bill, and checked into the Rihga Royal Hotel in midtown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four officers involved in the 12:45 A.M. shooting last Thursday are Edward McMellon, 26, Sean Carroll, 35, Kenneth Boss, 27, and Richard Murphy, 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after the shooting, Police Commissioner Howard Safir ordered the commander of the street crime unit to have daily discussions with his officers about the use of firearms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we are doing is taking a close look at our training procedures, both tactical procedures and ways police officers communicate among each other in enforcement situations,&quot; Patrick E. Kelleher, first deputy commissioner, said at a news conference. Mr. Kelleher said, however, that he did not think there was a problem in the way the department handled encounters with suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Safir has praised the street crime unit, which patrols at night looking for crimes about to occur, as a major reason for a sharp reduction of shootings. But prosecutors have said the unit's aggressive tactics, including searches and chases without probable cause, have sometimes led judges to throw out cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Mayor canceled a political trip to Texas this week to deal with the shooting, Commissioner Safir traveled on Saturday with his wife to a law enforcement conference in Los Angeles. Asked in Los Angeles yesterday why he left the city in the aftermath of the shooting, Commissioner Safir said only, &quot;I'm going back this afternoon.&quot; The Police Department said yesterday that the Commissioner had been in &quot;constant contact&quot; from the time he left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor said he saw nothing wrong with the Police Commissioner's attending the conference. &quot;Frankly, you know, there is no crisis or emergency going on and things have been proceeding quite normally,&quot; Mr. Giuliani said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators have not found any witnesses other than the four officers who can explain why the police confronted Mr. Diallo in the doorway of his apartment building or why they fired. The officers' lawyer has said that they flashed badges and that Mr. Diallo, instead of responding to their commands, made gestures they mistook for pulling a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime scene investigators, however, have found some evidence that might help explain why the officers, armed with 9-millimeter semiautomatic handguns, fired so many bullets, a police official said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said investigators found that at least three of the bullets ended up on the street and sidewalk behind the officers, suggesting that they had ricocheted off the door or walls of the building. Perhaps, the official said, the officers had the impression during the fusillade that they were being fired at. &quot;It does not explain why they fired, but it might explain why there was an additional number of rounds,&quot; the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators are also exploring what role, if any, Officer McMellon's fall outside Mr. Diallo's building may have played in the shooting. Officer McMellon somehow fell backward, suffering a slight fracture to his tailbone. But investigators say they have yet to learn if the fall created a false impression among the other officers that he had been shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the police shell casings were found on the stairs and sidewalk in front of the building, at 1157 Wheeler Avenue. One casing, though, was found in the vestibule, not far from Mr. Diallo's body, investigators said. But officials said that did not necessarily mean that any shots had been fired at close range. The Medical Examiner's office declined comment on whether Mr. Diallo's body showed powder burns, which could indicate a shooting at close range.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the shooting, the officers did not tell any commanders at the scene what happened, according to investigators, who have interviewed at least 12 officers who arrived at the scene minutes after the shooting.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has provoked many emotions among New York City's officers. Some who spoke yesterday expressed pity for Mr. Diallo and his family. Others said they were surprised by the number of bullets fired and concerned over what the political fallout will be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most of all, they said they identified with the four officers who fired 41 shots at Mr. Diallo, a 22-year-old street vendor from Guinea, as he stood in the early hours of Feb. 4 in front of his two-story apartment building in the Bronx with a pager and some keys. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At night, you see a black shadow coming up, and you might think it's a gun,&quot; said Officer Howard Kurz, who was standing outside the Midtown North Precinct station house on West 54th Street yesterday. &quot;I've been a cop for 19 years, worked all over the city, and I'd never arm-chair quarterback what happens at 1 in the morning on a Bronx street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In interviews with 17 officers in precincts from Harlem to Brooklyn, officers said that they could imagine themselves right there in that vestibule, making a mistake that could cost them their jobs or lead to the death of an innocent civilian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel sorry for them,&quot; said Sgt. Robert Reehil, a plainclothes officer also at Midtown North. &quot;Every day, their names are in the paper. Their addresses are in the paper. Their careers are in the paper.&quot; And every day on television, he said, there is file footage of the officers walking out of their lawyer's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he heard the news, Officer Kurz said, he thought: &quot;Those guys are in for a bad ride. They're in the Bronx. They're white cops. Their families are going to be torn up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers who were interviewed yesterday struggled to describe the uncertain world they confront at the beginning of each shift, and the self-doubt that lingers long after the shift ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One officer spoke of beginning to squeeze the trigger when he mistook a portable music player for a gun. Another spoke of her fear about whether the commands &quot;freeze&quot; or &quot;don't move&quot; were even comprehensible to many people on the city streets, given the array of languages spoken there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are the questions that come from officers' spouses, parents and children. Sergeant Reehil said that after the shooting, his wife asked, &quot;How could someone shoot 41 rounds at one guy?&quot; Standing outside the station house yesterday, dressed in khakis and a sweatshirt, he shrugged. &quot;I can't explain it. I wasn't there.&quot; But he said his views have been shaped by the fact that his brother, also a police officer, had been shot and wounded in the line of duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yvette Matthews, also an officer at Midtown North, agreed with Sergeant Reehil. &quot;They ask us questions, as though we're supposed to know the answers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers said any of the 30 to 40 calls on a typical shift could explode into catastrophe. Such rapid-fire crises can leave officers stricken by headaches, taut with fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You ever see those kaleidoscopes when you were a kid?&quot; asked Officer Ronald Fagan at the 84th Precinct station house on Tillary Street in Brooklyn. &quot;That's what happens in your brain after a shift and everything you saw and everything you didn't do flashes through your mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there are the career-ending mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some white officers at the 84th Precinct in Brooklyn said they often feel isolated and up against a wall as politicians exploit the racial aspect of such cases and the news media pile on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's more or less like we're political pawns for the public and politicians,&quot; said one officer there with 17 years experience, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. &quot;In Nassau and Suffolk, they back you up. Here, you're suspended for 30 days before you even go to trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A minority officer at the precinct, who joined the conversation, did not question the role of politicians but rather the number of bullets fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Fagan said that he thought the police brass were tough on members of the force. &quot;I don't think that anyone will deny that police officers have a profound lack of due process,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the treacherous waters they navigate, some officers said that they feel that vigilance, even fear, can be their closest ally. &quot;Fear is survival,&quot; said Officer Matthews of Midtown North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it can also lead to rash actions -- or no action at all. Officer Kurz recalled the time he was at the Lefrak City apartment complex in Queens and shots were being fired at him. He stood there, terrified, and didn't even take out his gun, he said, because he knew that the shots could have been coming from any one of &quot;10,000 windows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reflections of these officers came the day after Mr. Diallo's mother arrived from Guinea to reclaim her son's body and swooned before the house where he was killed. There was little disagreement among officers that the shooting was a tragedy -- a life lost, four careers potentially ended and a police force placed under public scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether they were right or wrong,&quot; Sergeant Reehil said, &quot;they killed an unarmed man and they have to live with that for the rest of their lives.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As more than 1,000 people gathered yesterday in the second angry demonstration in three days to protest the killing of an unarmed African street vendor by four police officers, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani canceled a political trip to Texas so he could meet with the victim's parents and perhaps attend a memorial service on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor's announcement came as the mother of the victim arrived in New York from Guinea and visited the Bronx building where her son, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 22, died in a barrage of 41 bullets at 12:45 A.M. last Thursday, for reasons still unexplained. Protesters have denounced the shooting and called for the Federal Government to take over the inquiry, but there were indications yesterday that Federal prosecutors would defer to the Bronx District Attorney for now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Diallo's mother, Kadiadou, stepped out of a dark police van at the site of the shooting, fell to the street, was helped to her feet, then cried out &quot;Amadou, Amadou.&quot; She was lifted by both arms up the stairs to the building's vestibule, which was filled with flowers and candles and pockmarked with bullet holes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she emerged half an hour later from the building at 1157 Wheeler Avenue, she said softly in English that &quot;justice must be done&quot; and that she wanted to take her son and bury him at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstration over the killing took place at lunchtime outside the Federal Courthouse in Foley Square, where protesters chanted for more than two hours, denouncing the Giuliani administration and demanding that Federal officials take charge of the investigation into Mr. Diallo's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they can shoot anyone 41 times,&quot; said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who led the protest, &quot;they can shoot everyone 41 times. It may start with blacks and Latinos, but it can go everywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although many in the crowd were apparently veterans of similar protests, others said they were demonstrating for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I take some of the responsibility for what happened,&quot; said Roger Bobb, a 31-year-old lawyer from Crown Heights, who said he had never participated in a protest. &quot;I've sat back too long while this kind of thing happens time and time again. I feel that as black people, we have not done enough to show Mayor Giuliani that we will not tolerate this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Giuliani has expressed concern and sympathy about Mr. Diallo's death, he continued to deny yesterday that the shooting was any indication of a pattern of excessive force by the Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The use of force by the department, the use of weapons is down, over the last four or five years, dramatically,&quot; he said, although accusations against the police for misconduct have risen sharply in New York in the past four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Diallo's death has become a major issue for the administration as it draws national attention to what critics contend is the dark side of Mr. Giuliani's achievements in bringing down crime -- the sense that aggressive police enforcement has created a climate that can breed brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Giuliani's trip to Texas would have been one of the most prominent in a series of political trips he has been making around the country as a potential candidate for higher office. He was to have made a speech on Thursday in Dallas and then fly to Austin to stay overnight at the Governor's Mansion with Gov. George W. Bush, a leading contender for the Republican Presidential nomination in 2000. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Bush had plans for a joint news conference on Friday. Aides to the Mayor said that the trip would be rescheduled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Giuliani said yesterday at City Hall that a final decision by a grand jury on whether the officers' actions were criminal is likely to take weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't make sense for me to comment on it every day because I'm not conducting the investigation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials have been unable to say why the four white officers thought their lives were in jeopardy or why they fired so many times at Mr. Diallo, who came to America more than two years ago from Guinea and had no criminal record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony of the four police officers is important because they are apparently the only witnesses to the encounter. They are all members of an aggressive street crimes unit, and three of them have been involved in previous shootings. The officers believed that Mr. Diallo had a gun, their lawyer has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Police Department has not yet interviewed the officers because police officials are deferring to the Bronx District Attorney. The four have also not been questioned by the District Attorney's investigators, because their lawyer has been negotiating the terms under which they would appear before a grand jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police official said that detectives have yet to find other witnesses who saw what happened at the outset of the incident, when the police officers first encountered Mr. Diallo in the vestibule. But one man, Francis Riva, 38, who lives across Wheeler Avenue from the shooting scene, said he told investigators on Monday that he heard three shots at first. &quot;There was a pause between shots,&quot; he said. &quot;Then it sounded like they all started firing at once.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers were patrolling the neighborhood in an unmarked car looking for a serial rapist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the four officers, Edward McMellon, fell during the encounter with Mr. Diallo, injuring his tailbone. But investigators said they had yet to determine whether that fall played any role in the incident, such as giving his fellow officers the false impression that he had been hit by a gunshot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday at the protest, Mr. Diallo's uncle, Mamadou Diallo, spoke to the crowd. &quot;I love my nephew deeply, and I will miss him daily,&quot; he said. &quot;And my sadness is made greater knowing that the four people who took his life are still walking free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd's demand that the case be taken over by Federal investigators will apparently not be met, at least for now. Yesterday the lawyer for the four officers, Stephen Worth, said that lawyers in the United States Attorney's office had assured him that they would monitor the case but not take it from the Bronx District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In return, Mr. Worth said his clients would &quot;most likely&quot; testify before a state grand jury, which is expected to begin hearing evidence later this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's rally was similar to one held on Sunday in front of Mr. Diallo's apartment building, and Mr. Sharpton said there would be another one next week in front of the Bronx Courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd at the protest was largely African-Americans and African immigrants. They shouted for justice and pumped their fists in the air. Many said that Mr. Diallo was shot only because of the color of his skin. Others shouted obscenities at the police officers gathered around the perimeter of the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man, Leslie Stewart, a 50-year-old employee of Bell Atlantic, said that Mr. Giuliani should take responsibility for the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he can't control his employees, he should quit,&quot; Mr. Stewart said. &quot;It's clear he cannot control this beast.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the many calls for Federal involvement in the police shooting of a Bronx immigrant last Thursday is the concern that state prosecutors may have a tough time bringing a case against the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is some history that may help to explain the concerns: in 1996, the Bronx District Attorney's office failed to win a conviction in a major police brutality prosecution, when Francis X. Livoti was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide in the death of Anthony Baez. Mr. Baez died in 1994 after a confrontation with the officer that began over a street football game. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After that state acquittal, Federal prosecutors opened a Federal civil rights investigation; Mr. Livoti was convicted and sentenced to seven and a half years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any state attempt to prosecute the officers for last week's shooting could be also fraught with legal complications and challenges. Under state law, police officers can use deadly force if they reasonably believe they face the threat or imminent threat of deadly force themselves. In the case last week, the lawyers for the police have argued that the officers had reason to believe that the victim, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might have been pulling a weapon on them. He was killed in a barrage of 41 bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They shot him, The killed him -- they feel very bad about that,&quot; Stephen Worth, their lawyer, said of the officers. &quot;That doesn't mean they committed a crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In several cases involving officers who said they felt they were in danger and shot unarmed civilians, state prosecutors failed to bring charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Christmas Day in 1997, for instance, Officer Michael J. Davitt shot an unarmed man, William J. Whitfield, in a confrontation at a Canarsie, Brooklyn, grocery store. Police officials said that the officers on the scene believed that Mr. Whitfield was behaving suspiciously, ordered him to halt and then, guns drawn, followed him when he dashed into a grocery store and seemed to hide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said Officer Davitt fired the fatal shot when Mr. Whitfield suddenly emerged, rising from a crouch. A state grand jury refused to bring charges, finding the shooting justified under the laws governing use of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal prosecutors looked into the case, but did not bring charges. Michael A. Hardy, a lawyer for the Whitfield family, said that although no Federal charges were filed, the review had been useful. &quot;One thing about the Federal Government is that they don't have the conflict of interest with the New York City police,&quot; Mr. Hardy said. &quot;They have demonstrated some commitment to bringing police up on charges and prosecuting them if necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal prosecutors often have more leeway in pursuing civil rights charges in such shootings. Federal rules of evidence are more liberal in some cases than in the state courts. Under the Federal civil rights laws, the Government does not have to prove that an officer caused a victim's death, only that the officer's acts resulted in bodily injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One argument for having Federal officials prosecute last week's shooting is that state prosecutors are not as well equipped to handle such cases. During the Federal trial of Mr. Livoti, Federal prosecutors raised some questions about how the Bronx District Attorney's office handled some witness interviews: for instance, when it allowed police officers to meet in a group and discuss the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, who is a former member of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's commission on police-citizen relations, said yesterday that many critics were underestimating Mr. Johnson's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited the 1997 conviction of Paolo Colecchia, who was found guilty of second-degree manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a fleeing unarmed man on a Bronx subway platform in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Johnson lawyers up there successfully prosecuted this cop,&quot; said Mr. Siegel, whose organization represented the victim's family. &quot;What they didn't successfully prosecute was Livoti. So the Livoti case sticks in everyone's mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer who defended Mr. Livoti, Stuart London, is working with Mr. Worth on behalf of the officers in the current investigation. Mr. London said that he believed that the fairest result would be for the grand jury investigating Mr. Diallo's death to conclude that the four officers reasonably believed that they were in fear for their lives, based on the suspicious behavior they perceived, and to spare them from criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, he suggested, the grand jury could issue a report questioning more generally the police tactics in the case, and suggest procedures that could be followed in the future. &quot;That would be a very viable and constructive option,&quot; he contended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal officials have already taken an active role in the latest inquiry. When the Bronx District Attorney's office began interviewing potential witnesses this week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there was a problem that suggested the jockeying that is likely to continue throughout the investigation. Several police officers who were to be interviewed objected to the F.B.I.'s presence, and the officers started talking only when assured that Federal agents would not listen in. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours of arriving from her homeland, Guinea, yesterday, the mother of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stepped from a dark police van a few yards from where her unarmed son was killed last Thursday, and instantly crumpled to the street. &quot;Wait, wait, wait,&quot; she moaned, clutching her stomach as though in pain, while police officers held back a crowd of reporters and grieving and angry bystanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadiadou Diallo cried, &quot;Amadou, Amadou,&quot; and was half-carried by police officials in business suits and Guinean diplomats in traditional robes into the modest apartment house at 1157 Wheeler Avenue in the Bronx where the police had fired 41 times at her son. The bullet holes riddling the doorframe and hallway had been marked and numbered with a black pen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Diallo, wearing a blue raincoat and with a pale green scarf draped over her head, wailed as she was escorted up the steps where a spray of blood was still faintly visible. &quot;I'm hurt,&quot; she said. &quot;I lost my son -- now he's gone.&quot; Mr. Diallo's father, a businessman, is expected to arrive today or tomorrow, and the family will then meet with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once Mrs. Diallo entered the vestibule, which was heaped with flowers and votive candles placed there by neighbors, her wails turned to screams that were audible from the street. She was followed inside by a representative from the Senegalese Embassy, Abid Denj; the President of the Guinean Association of America, Mohamed Jalloh, and several of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> friends and roommates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 45 minutes later, Mrs. Diallo emerged and, speaking softly in careful English, said, &quot;I want to bring him home to bury him.&quot; Her son was from a &quot;good family,&quot; she added. Just before climbing back into the police van, she was asked by a reporter whether she had a message for New Yorkers. She did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice,&quot; she said, &quot; must be done.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the movies, a fusillade of 41 bullets is nothing, a Schwarzenegger second. In real life, the storm of police gunfire that killed an unarmed West African immigrant last week was a brutal human tragedy that has left a Bronx neighborhood shaken and angry about the aggressive Street Crimes Unit that is supposed to be making the community a safer place to live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting occurred shortly after midnight last Thursday when four plainclothes officers from the Street Crimes Unit saw a man in the vestibule of a Bronx apartment building. For reasons that are still unclear, they suddenly emptied their guns at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a 22-year-old street merchant from Guinea. Mr. Diallo, who spoke halting English and had no police record, died at the scene. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A lawyer for the policemen told journalists that &quot;fair-minded people&quot; would recognize that &quot;this shooting, although tragic, was proper.&quot; He said that the four had been seeking a serial rapist who resembled Mr. Diallo, and that they thought he was acting suspiciously and was reaching for a weapon. They found only a wallet and a beeper in his pockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States Attorney's office is reviewing the case, which is under investigation by the Bronx District Attorney. One police official told The Times that &quot;it looks as though one guy may have panicked and the rest followed suit.&quot; What makes that disturbing is that while the city says that more than 90 percent of New York's police officers never fire their guns, three of the four officers in this case have been involved in shootings before, with two found to have acted properly and one incident still under review by the Brooklyn District Attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has wisely counseled New Yorkers not to rush to judgment, and he has offered aid to Mr. Diallo's family through the city's Community Assistance Unit. The Mayor has also assured African diplomats including the Guinean Ambassador that the case is being investigated properly. That is a good start, but the Mayor must find a way to assure the city's immigrants and minorities that policemen from outside their neighborhoods do not reflexively suspect a person of color and resort to force too readily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite efforts by the Mayor and the Police Commissioner to encourage community relations and hold precinct commanders responsible for complaints, there is a long history of suspicion that makes it difficult for many to forgive the fusillade as a simple mistake. It is critically important that city and Federal investigators find answers as quickly as possible to the troubling questions raised by this case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As friends and family made funeral arrangements yesterday for an unarmed street peddler shot dead by the New York City police, a diplomat from the victim's homeland of Guinea in West Africa said his countrymen were concerned that the four officers involved have not been arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aboubacar Dione, the first consul of Guinea's permanent mission to the United Nations, said the police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 22, who was killed Thursday in a barrage of 41 bullets, has drawn considerable attention in his country, a nation beset by desperate poverty and convulsed by eight months of civil war. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People back home -- the entire African continent -- is following this case. They don't understand why these four are still free,&quot; Mr. Dione said at the mission on East 39th Street. As he spoke, he received a call from Guinea's minister of foreign affairs, one of many he said he gets about the case each morning from officials in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the police have said that there were no witnesses to the shooting, WCBS-TV news broadcast an interview last night with a man who said he lived across the street from Mr. Diallo and had seen part of the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, whose identity was not revealed, said he heard shots and went to his window. There was a brief pause, he said, and then the shooting resumed. &quot;By the time I got to the window, now they're shooting again,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man said that after the shooting stopped, he went down to the street and tried to give information to investigators at the scene, but that he and several other witnesses were told to leave and some were cursed at by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WCBS-TV also said that the man had told his story to the Bronx District Attorney's office, but a spokesman for the District Attorney would not comment last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials declined to comment last night on the man's claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday afternoon, the Bronx District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson, met for 30 minutes with six of the dead man's relatives and friends, including his uncle, Mamadou Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a very good meeting,&quot; said Kyle B. Watters, a lawyer for the Diallo family. &quot;The District Attorney assured us he was doing everything he can to see that justice is done. He told us that an investigation was going forward and that they were interviewing potential witnesses today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Johnson's office is expected to begin presenting evidence and witnesses to a grand jury later this week. Prosecutors are likely to begin any presentation with a series of witnesses who would establish the broad circumstances of Mr. Diallo's death, such as the fact that he was hit by 19 of the bullets fired at him as he stood unarmed in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers, who were searching for a rape suspect, have not spoken to investigators. But their lawyer, Stephen Worth, has said they thought Mr. Diallo had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Worth has said that he would probably allow the officers -- Edward McMellon, 26, Sean Carroll, 35, Kenneth Boss, 27, and Richard Murphy, 26 -- to testify without immunity before a grand jury if certain conditions were met. Three of the officers returned to work on administrative assignments yesterday, and the fourth called in sick, Mr. Worth said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Diallo's father and mother are scheduled to arrive in New York today, and the family is planning to hold a memorial service on Friday at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York on East 96th Street. The family is then expected to fly the body of Mr. Diallo home to Guinea, which he left for New York two years ago. Before leaving, the family is expected to meet with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, city officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one wants to lose a child,&quot; Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference yesterday, &quot;and the idea of even talking to the father and talking to him about his losing his son in a foreign country is a terrible, terrible thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preparations were also being made for a rally at noon today outside United States District Court in Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor spent two hours at City Hall yesterday with members of the United African Congress, his second meeting in as many days with representatives of New York's West Africans. Mr. Giuliani told reporters later that he had tried to explain the slow pace of careful justice. &quot;Investigations, as you know, take longer than anybody expects,&quot; he said. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chanting &quot;no justice, no peace&quot; and saying the time may have come to &quot;fight back,&quot; almost 1,000 people staged an angry rally yesterday on a snowy street in front of the Bronx home of a 22-year-old merchant gunned down in a storm of 41 bullets by four New York City police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While community leaders and politicians spoke to the crowd through a microphone muffled by static, the voices and the outrage of the demonstrators -- some of whom had traveled from Connecticut and New Jersey -- came through loud and clear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soaked and shivering, they said they had been moved to action by the brutality of the killing last Thursday. The victim, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who came to the United States more than two years ago from Guinea, West Africa, was unarmed when he died and had never been in trouble with the law. Like an echo, almost everyone interviewed said the words, &quot;41 bullets,&quot; &quot;four officers,&quot; and &quot;one man dead.&quot; The number of shots, as much as the shots themselves, defied understanding, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, in a sign that the killing could inflame racial tension in the city, almost everyone interviewed said they believed that the police officers had judged Mr. Diallo as a criminal because of the color of his skin. The only white speaker, Kyle Waters, the lawyer for the relatives of Mr. Diallo, was shouted off the podium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd stood shoulder to shoulder and nearly filled the block around 1157 Wheeler Avenue, where Mr. Diallo lived and died as police followed him through his front door. It is a worn, but well-kept block of houses and low-rise apartment buildings that neighbors had bragged about as a quiet, peaceful place -- until the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, at least two dozen police officers patrolled the area, posted at the corners of the block and on the subway bridge overhead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions were high, and most people's voices were filled with contempt. But the rally remained largely peaceful -- with several dozen Muslims offering prayers to Allah and a group of Guineans dancing around a drummer -- except for a flash of tension when half a dozen police officers gathered around the perimeter of the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the demonstrators rushed over and shouted at the officers. A wall of protesters with calmer heads formed between the angry mob and the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just let me over there, and I'll kill a police officer,&quot; growled one man, trying to push through the line. The police, only a few feet away, glared back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Enough is enough!&quot; the crowd of mostly young men began to chant. Behind them, an older man stood wailing: &quot;We're dying. We're dying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One demonstrator stood in the snow with a bright-yellow banner bearing the words &quot;41 Bullets.&quot; He said his first name was Tony and that he was a 31-year-old accountant, but added that he did not think his name was an important identifier. He called himself simply an African-American man -- an identity, he said, that in New York was enough to get you killed by the people who are ordered to protect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a decent, moral-minded American,&quot; he said, looking at the small red-brick apartment building in front of him. &quot;But it seems like that doesn't matter. What happened here, could have happened to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers who shot Mr. Diallo have not yet spoken with investigators. But their lawyer, Stephen Worth, has said that the officers believed they were in danger because they thought Mr. Diallo had a gun. &quot;They recognize the tragedy that a man died, and was not armed at the time,&quot; Mr. Worth said on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of those in the crowd were African-Americans or immigrants from countries in West Africa, who said they felt as if they had lost a brother. Professionals stood with blue-collar workers who carried homemade posters of skeletons wearing police uniforms. Retirees and college graduates pumped their fists into the air and shouted &quot;Black power!&quot; And parents coaxed their children to pay attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators demanded that Federal investigators take over the investigation. They attacked Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as callous for failing to issue a strong condemnation of the crime; for failing to visit Mr. Diallo's relatives and for failing to order the arrest of the officers involved with the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mamadou Ka, who came to New York five years ago from Senegal, said of Mr. Giuliani, &quot;When people shoot cops, he is there, but when cops shoot people he doesn't show up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making it clear that they do not believe all police officers are bad, the demonstrators expressed deep anger at the officers involved with the shooting. Some people called the officers &quot;renegades,&quot; and a &quot;quartet of bandits,&quot; and they urged that the officers be immediately arrested and prosecuted for murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am more afraid of the police than I am of a criminal,&quot; said Gloria Jackson, a union organizer, wearing an African scarf over her long, brown braids. &quot;Police look at me and see a black woman, and the first thing they think is that I might cause trouble. They see me as a threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers' lawyer, Mr. Worth, defended his clients yesterday, saying it was far too early to judge their actions. &quot;In this day and age, it is unfortunate and somewhat predictable that every incident involving the police is used by different groups for their own agenda,&quot; Mr. Worth said in a telephone interview. &quot;I hope that all fair-minded people will await the conclusion of the investigation. If they do they will see that the police conduct, although tragic, was justified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Bryant, 43, who came to yesterday's rally from Bloomfield, N.J., urged that the New York Police Department assign officers to patrol the neighborhoods they live in. &quot;We have police officers who have never been to a black neighborhood out here,&quot; he said. &quot;All they see is a black man and a black face and they see trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to Mr. Diallo, he added, &quot;If the officers had come from this neighborhood, they would have known this man wasn't no criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Joyce Pinckney, 60, who performs background checks for prospective New York City police officers, said she felt there needed to be more sensitivity training for officers, and stronger messages from the top of the department that abuse of authority would not be tolerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally, organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton, was attended by the relatives of several people who had been killed in police shootings. And Michael Jones, who was shot 17 times by two police officers in August in Brooklyn, attended the rally in a wheelchair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It opened up all the wounds again of all the mothers that are here,&quot; said Iris Baez, whose son Anthony was killed in a confrontation with police officers in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sharpton told the crowd he would continue to call on city officials to place the officers involved in the shooting on trial, and he urged them to attend another rally scheduled for Tuesday at Foley Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not anti-police,&quot; Mr. Sharpton said. &quot;We are anti-police brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A criminal is a criminal, whether he is wearing a blue uniform or blue jeans,&quot; he said.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcry over the killing of an unarmed West African immigrant in a fusillade of 41 police bullets spread to the national stage yesterday, as the president of the N.A.A.C.P. condemned the shooting as &quot;excessive force at its worst&quot; and urged the United States Attorney General, Janet Reno, to reassure Americans that such incidents will not be tolerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president, Kweisi Mfume, said he would ask Ms. Reno today to make a public statement that &quot;the Justice Department will use every possible vehicle to get to the facts involved in the case and make sure that justice is fair and swift.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Mfume's comments were the first indication that national attention is beginning to focus on the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Thursday. Mr. Diallo, a 22-year-old street peddler with no criminal record, was hit by 19 of the bullets fired by four police officers in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mfume said he did not think it necessary for the Justice Department in Washington to take over the criminal investigation, which is being directed by the Bronx District Attorney's office and being monitored by the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan. But he said Federal officials needed to do more now than just review the incident in anticipation of a possible civil rights case down the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saying you are monitoring it does not assure Americans enough that there is going to be a quick attempt to get to the facts of the case,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Ms. Reno, Myron Marlin, said, &quot;The Civil Rights Division in Washington is already working together with the local U.S. Attorney's office, but we will consider any request by Mr. Mfume and will determine what additional action will be needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials have been unable to explain why the four officers, all members of an aggressive Street Crimes Unit with five to seven years' experience on the force, thought their lives had been in jeopardy, or why they had fired so many times. The officers, who were searching for a rape suspect when they encountered Mr. Diallo, have yet to speak to investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But their lawyer, Stephen Worth, has said the officers had believed Mr. Diallo had a gun. According to a person close to the officers, the four said Mr. Diallo did not respond to their spoken commands and made motions with his hands and arms that the officers interpreted as threatening. When the barrage of bullets had ceased, however, only a wallet and a pager were found next to Mr. Diallo's body in the doorway of 1157 Wheeler Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A state grand jury is scheduled to begin hearing testimony this week as it evaluates whether the officers should be charged criminally. Mr. Worth has said he will probably allow the officers to testify at that proceeding without immunity as long as he is assured that the Federal authorities will not intervene in the criminal case until the state grand jury has completed its deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement yesterday, the office of the United States Attorney in Manhattan, Mary Jo White, hinted strongly that it intended to let the state case go forward before deciding whether to proceed with a Federal civil rights case of its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have complete confidence in the ability of the Bronx District Attorney to determine whether the shooting violated any state laws,&quot; Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the office, said in a statement. &quot;We will coordinate closely with Mr. Johnson's office as his investigation proceeds.&quot; He referred to Robert Johnson, the District Attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the testimony of officers in shooting incidents is always important, the accounts of the officers in this case -- Sean Carroll, 35, Edward McMellon, 26, Kenneth Boss, 27, and Richard Murphy, 26 -- are particularly so because there were apparently no other witnesses. Detectives have been scouring Mr. Diallo's neighborhood, the Soundview section of the Bronx, for witnesses, without success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to clarify whether Federal prosecutors were committed to letting the state case proceed first, Mr. Smilon said he could not elaborate. But he did offer a more detailed explanation of why Federal prosecutors decided to enter the case so early, saying it was based not on a particular request from anyone, but on &quot;the public importance of the matter and the possibility that Federal civil rights laws might be implicated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer for the officers, Mr. Worth, said he would call prosecutors today in hopes of settling terms under which his clients would testify. But he said the Federal authorities, so far, had made no promises to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll have to hear from the horse's mouth before making a decision as to whether they will testify,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers have been removed from patrol and given administrative assignments pending the investigation, which is routine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting is one in a series of police incidents that have led some New Yorkers to complain that the same aggressive police work credited in part for the decline in crime has also led to an increase in police brutality, particularly against minority residents. Mr. Diallo was black; the officers are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mfume alluded to that context while announcing the decision by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to join a chorus of voices in New York expressing outrage at the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The N.A.A.C.P. will be joining with other concerned citizens in an attempt to underscore the absolute foolishness of excessive police brutality that has reared its ugly head again in New York, and again involving a person of color,&quot; he said. &quot;The N.A.A.C.P. simply does not believe there is any legitimate excuse or explanation for what took place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Worth said Mr. Mfume was too quick to judge the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How anyone on the outside can know that this was an unjustifiable shooting mystifies me,&quot; he said. &quot;Both the Police Commissioner and the Mayor recognized that the mere number of shots alone does not make this a crime on the part of the police officers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mfume, who spent 10 years in Congress as a Democratic Representative from Maryland, said he also planned to ask Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to quickly and forcefully criticize the police behavior as he did in the case of Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant whom police officers have been accused of torturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was quick to denounce it, and I would like him to use his bully pulpit to let New Yorkers know he denounces this as well,&quot; Mr. Mfume said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani, said the Mayor had already expressed his support for Federal involvement in the investigation and his sympathy about the death of Mr. Diallo, who immigrated from Guinea two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is he concerned about the fact that 41 shots were fired? Absolutely,&quot; she said. &quot;But he would like to wait until all the facts are in before making that kind of judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor spent part of yesterday afternoon in a 45-minute meeting at City Hall, where he briefed the Guinean Ambassador to the United Nations, Mahawa Bangoura Kamara, and the Guinean Ambassador to the United States and Brazil, Mohammad Thiam, on the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They talked about keeping lines of communication open and told them we would apprise them of new facts as they develop,&quot; Ms. Roche said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Ms. Roche said, the Mayor spoke by telephone with Mr. Diallo's father, who is in transit to New York from Vietnam, where he was on business. But Ms. Roche said she could not discuss what the two men had said, calling it a private conversation.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The type of gun used by four New York City police officers last week in the fatal shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant is the weapon of choice among law enforcement agencies across the country in the continually escalating arms race between the police and criminals, experts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The barrage of 41 bullets sprayed at 22-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the vestibule of his Bronx building early Thursday has revived questions about the safety of 9-millimeter semiautomatic handguns, which fire faster and carry more bullets than the .38-caliber revolvers they replaced in the New York City Police Department six years ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended the use of 9-millimeters and praised the New York force for &quot;being just about the most restrained Police Department in the country,&quot; even as he described the shooting as a &quot;terrible tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say that there is no clear link between semiautomatics and the number of shootings by the police, and that officers are likely to get higher-powered weapons rather than go back to traditional handguns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 99 percent of the nation's municipal police forces with more than 100 officers now authorize the use of semiautomatic weapons, with 74 percent of the agencies allowing 9-millimeter handguns like the ones involved in the New York incident, according to a forthcoming study by the Federal Justice Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York was among the last to switch to semiautomatics; most cities opted for more firepower in the mid-1980's, many prompted by a 1986 shootout in Miami in which F.B.I. agents ran out of bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The threats nowadays are a lot more than they were years ago,&quot; said Robert DelCore of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. &quot;If you go back 30 years, you'd have a guy who might have pulled a gun at you but who wouldn't fire. Go back 20 years, maybe they'd fire at you, a little Saturday Night Special. Now it's escalated to where they carry little machine guns. You've got to be prepared to meet the threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminologists said there had been no studies comparing the number and severity of police shootings with semiautomatics versus revolvers, and a spokesman for the New York City Police Department said he could not separate statistics based on the type of weapon used. While several experts said anecdotal evidence indicates that the number of shots fired per incident increases when guns such as the 9-millimeter are used, they also noted that the number of police shootings -- in New York and across the nation -- has declined sharply even as the semiautomatic weapons have become standard issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York, the rate of fatal police shootings per 1,000 officers was 0.48 last year, the lowest since 1985, and lower than the rates in Chicago, Dallas, Miami, Philadelphia or Washington. The number of shootings, and the shots fired per incident, have fallen with the crime rate during the last four years: There were 344 shootings with an average of 5 rounds fired in 1995, and 249 incidents with an average of 3.4 shots fired last year, according to Inspector Michael Collins, an N.Y.P.D. spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The critical question in analyzing police shootings, law enforcement experts said, is why officers pulled the trigger, not which guns they were using.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever the gun is, because they can all kill, the bigger problem is the quick trigger,&quot; said David Lerner, a spokesman for the Center for Constitutional Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's much more about training, accountability and protocol than it is about the weapon,&quot; said Paul Chevigny, a law professor at New York University. &quot;I don't want to sound cold-hearted; Mr. Diallo might be alive if they hadn't had automatic weapons. But I don't think it makes that much difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a practical matter, the difference would likely have been in the number of shots fired. Two of the four officers emptied their 16-bullet magazines in the incident: Had they been carrying revolvers, they would have had just 6 bullets each before needing to reload. The Medical Examiner says 19 bullets hit Mr. Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another difference is in the impact of the bullets hitting their target.  Unlike the .38, experts said, several bullets fired from a 9-millimeter could hit a man without knocking him down, which could lead officers to continue shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These bullets would be passing through him so fast that he could still be standing,&quot; explained Steven M. Edwards, who oversees police research for the Federal Government's National Institute of Justice. &quot;You have to remember this is happening in nanoseconds. There's fright and flight that are operating here as well. It's not something as rational as it may sound.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police favor the 9-millimeter handguns not only because they discharge quickly, unloading up to 18 bullets in about four seconds, but because they carry more rounds and can be reloaded simply and fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a semiautomatic, the 9-millimeter, like the .38-caliber revolver it replaced, fires only one round each time the trigger is pulled. But it recocks itself after each shot, placing another bullet in the chamber, and thus can release a succession of bullets quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lighter than the .38, the &quot;9,&quot; as it is known, rests more naturally in a shooter's palm, and often increases accuracy. But the real attraction is the magazine, which holds up to three times as many bullets as a revolver, and the ease of reloading. A 9 is refilled in a two-step process that takes about four seconds, can be done in the dark, and has been compared to popping a disk into a computer; reloading a revolver takes two hands, eight separate movements, and about 12 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York originally allowed magazines of just 10 bullets, and now uses clips of 16. The city also commissioned a special device that increases the amount of pressure needed to pull the trigger, from about 5.5 pounds to about 12 pounds. Most patrol officers use semiautomatics, though a handful of veterans have kept their .38's, officials said. All four of the officers in the Bronx shootings had 9-millimeters; two were Sig Sauer models, one was a Glock and one was manufactured by Smith &amp; Wesson, the police said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the potential for increased number of rounds fired, critics question the reliability of the 9-millimeters. &quot;In a way, it's like saying Porsches are faster and more powerful than Chevys, so we should equip the cops with Porsches,&quot; said James T. Fyfe, a criminologist at Temple University who questioned the shift to nines. &quot;Chevys start every morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the public does not like seeing the police outgunned. Police shootings with large numbers of shots fired cause little outrage compared with incidents like the Los Angeles bank robbery in 1997 in which officers had to borrow weapons from a gun shop to battle suspects with machine guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than reconsider the move toward 9's, police departments are looking at even more powerful guns: 15 percent of the municipal departments currently authorize 10-millimeter semiautomatics, according to the upcoming Justice Department study, 41 percent use .45-calibers and 50 percent use .40-calibers, both more powerful guns than the 9-millimeter. Some departments, experts say, are now allowing officers to carry fully automatic rifles in their cars rather than shotguns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lingering concern would be whether there is adequate policy and enforcement and training having to do with how many shots you fire and when to stop shooting,&quot; Mr. Edwards said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Walsh, vice president of New York's Police Benevolent Association, said the semiautomatic handgun &quot;is a tool of necessity today,&quot; and noted that New York police officers are &quot;trained to shoot to stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If an incident is stopped in one round, then we shoot one round,&quot; he said. &quot;If it's stopped in five, it'll be that many.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it remains a mystery why all four officers fired, and fired so many times, in the Bronx shooting, Mr. Fyfe said that, in general, he is more troubled by incidents in which only one officer out of a group fires.  &quot;You have to wonder what he saw that no one else saw,&quot; Mr. Fyfe said, speaking hypothetically. &quot;If you think about the options here, you either have four homicidal maniacs who happen to be working together, or you have four rational guys who all saw the same thing. The chances are, you don't have four homicidal maniacs.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four police officers who killed an unarmed West African immigrant in a fusillade of 41 gunshots will waive immunity and testify before a Bronx grand jury this week if they receive assurances that a Federal inquiry will not intervene and expose them to whipsawing between Federal and state prosecutors, a person close to the officers said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day after Federal officials announced that they were joining the Bronx District Attorney in investigating the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 22, on Thursday, there were no major developments in the investigation of a case that has raised a storm of protest from community and religious leaders, African-American groups, politicians and acquaintances of the slain man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the intervention of the Federal officials, who said only that they would be working closely with District Attorney Robert T. Johnson, appeared to be subtly affecting the behind-the-scenes legal maneuvering to obtain firsthand accounts of a shooting whose only witnesses appear to be the officers who fired the fatal bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What worries the officers' lawyer, Stephen Worth, is that Federal officials could pre-empt the state grand jury after they testify, and summon them before a Federal grand jury, said the person close to the officers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the officers told substantially the same story before the state and Federal grand juries, this person said, they might be caught in contradictions, however minor, that might cast doubt on their accounts. Because the officers will have waived immunity, he said, such contradictions might expose them to criminal prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision of the United States Attorney in Manhattan, Mary Jo White, to join the investigation did not signal a Federal takeover of the case, officials have said. Instead, the Federal officials will consider possible civil rights violations, while the District Attorney examines criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Normally, Federal officials do not enter a case until later, especially if state prosecutors fail to win a conviction. The early Federal intervention in this case did not suggest a lack of confidence in the District Attorney, some officials said, but may have been intended to reassure the public in a case with potentially explosive political implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Worth, a lawyer hired by the officers through the auspices of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, declined to comment yesterday on whether his clients would be willing to waive immunity and testify, or to say whether they would insist upon any conditions in exchange for their testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are not afraid of talking,&quot; Mr. Worth said. &quot;But it is my advice that they not do so until we see which agency is going to handle this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Worth said the officers did not intend to speak publicly about what happened, but he noted that they were aware of the public outcry over the case and felt sorrow over the death of a man said to be a devout Muslim and a hard-working street peddler who had never been in trouble with the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These men are human beings,&quot; Mr. Worth said of the officers. &quot;They have a job to do, and they try to do it well. They did not wake up and say, 'Let's shoot a street peddler today.' They recognize the tragedy that a man died, and was not armed at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, detectives continued to search for witnesses on the Wheeler Avenue block, in the Soundview section, where the shooting occurred. But, as on Thursday and Friday, they found no one who acknowledged having seen the shooting in the vestibule at No. 1157.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests over the shooting continued yesterday. At Wheeler and Westchester Avenues, a half-block from Mr. Diallo's door, about 30 people, rallying under the banners of the Progressive Labor Party, marched in a circle with signs that read: &quot;Smash Police Brutality&quot; and &quot;Destroy Police Terror With Communist Revolution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A prayer vigil and rally was scheduled for 2 P.M. today at the scene of the shooting by the Rev. Al Sharpton. Mr. Diallo's father, a businessman currently working in Vietnam, was on his way to New York, but it was not clear whether he would be present for the rally. He is to take the body home to Guinea, West Africa, later this week for burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani continued yesterday to urge the public and political leaders to exercise restraint in judging the case, which he called &quot;a terrible tragedy.&quot; The Mayor said his community assistance unit would aid Mr. Diallo's family, including providing transportation expenses for his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor said any criticism of the police had to be balanced against what he called a record of restraint and respect for the public that the department had demonstrated in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This individual incident is of great concern, and it is one that should be investigated very thoroughly,&quot; he said. &quot;But it would be very unfair to jump from this incident to accuse an entire Police Department and to take away from the credit they deserve for being just about the most restrained Police Department in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Giuliani praised the Bronx District Attorney for what he said was a cautious approach, calling it &quot;absolutely sound and justifiable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also defended the Police Department's use of rapid-firing 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistols, a policy that has been criticized by some political leaders. &quot;The fact is, since police officers have had 9-millimeter weapons, they have actually discharged less than before that,&quot; the Mayor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he defended the department's Street Crimes Unit, to which all four of the officers belong. The unit is made up of plainclothes officers who roam the city in unmarked cars on the lookout for crimes in progress and suspects in rape, robbery and weapons cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four officers involved in the shooting -- Edward McMellon, 26; Sean Carroll, 35; Kenneth Boss, 27, and Richard Murphy, 26 -- have been on the force for only five to seven years, but together have made 279 felony arrests. All but Officer Murphy have been involved in previous shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an unofficial account provided by the person close to the officers, they were said to have approached Mr. Diallo as he arrived at the vestibule of his building about 12:35 A.M. on Thursday. They had seen him acting in some &quot;suspicious&quot; way, and thought he resembled the sketch of a rapist they were seeking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He failed to comply when the officers asked him to do something, which was not specified in this account. There may have been a language problem. Mr. Diallo spoke English, but slowly and with a stutter. The officers opened fire when they thought he reached for a gun, a person familiar with their account said, although Mr. Diallo carried only a wallet and a beeper. It was unclear which officer fired first, but all joined in firing once it started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 14th Street, between Second and Third Avenues, where Mr. Diallo had worked for a year and a half selling videos, hats, gloves and scarves from a table on the sidewalk, a makeshift memorial had been set up on the table yesterday: candles, flowers, signs and newspaper articles about his slaying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Amadou, we love you and will miss you very much,&quot; one sign read. Another said: &quot;May you rest in the hands of Allah.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violent death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an unarmed Guinean immigrant who was killed by four New York City police officers on Thursday, has profoundly disturbed the small but growing West African community in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the West Africans have fled civil wars and repression in the past decade, and some said yesterday that the shooting made them question the often difficult decision to emigrate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It makes you wonder whether leaving your troubled home was a mistake,&quot; said Peter Wennah, a Liberian who runs a small grocery. &quot;America was supposed to be a safe haven, but if you get shot by the police, who else can you turn to?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Diallo was not fleeing war. Rather, friends said, he was seeking opportunity. Guinea is a desperately poor country, where illiteracy hovers at 80 percent and avenues for advancement are few. Mr. Diallo was determined to get some education and help his family back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West Africans have come to New York in growing numbers in recent years, pushed by strife and poverty, lured by opportunity and an expansion in the number of visas available to Africans. In 1990, there were about 44,000 Africans in New York City; in 1996, there were around 84,000. There are no exact figures on how many are from West Africa. City planning officials estimated that as of 1996, there were fewer than 1,000 Guineans in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans are spread throughout the five boroughs, with about 30 percent in Manhattan. About one-fourth are in the Bronx, where they live in small clusters, often in the neighborhoods that fan out along the Grand Concourse. Sidique Abubakarr Wai, the president of the United African Congress, said he thought new immigrants were increasingly settling in the Bronx, leading his organization to hold its African Pride Day Parade there last May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Mr. Diallo was mourned not as a Guinean, but as an African. And just as the allegations that Brooklyn police officers brutalized Abner Louima politicized the Haitian community, Mr. Diallo's death may do the same for the African community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not here to say we declare war on New York City's Finest,&quot; Mr. Wai said before delivering an angry demand for justice, including a Federal investigation and a jury trial. But, he said, &quot;the life of a black person is as valuable as the life of another person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he condemned the police for firing 41 bullets at Mr. Diallo, Mr. Wai also condemned them for failing to vigorously seek the murderers of several dozen Senegalese cabdrivers who have been killed over the past decade or so. &quot;When crimes are committed in other communities, you could see an avalanche of activity leading to the arrest and conviction of those people -- very speedy thing,&quot; he said. &quot;What we are saying here is let there be a universal application of the rule of law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anger about Mr. Diallo's death was not confined to the city's Africans. Mr. Diallo's neighbors, many of whom are not African, said they were outraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Forty-one shots -- forty-one shots,&quot; said Nilsa Ortiz, who lives across the street. &quot;Even if he was a criminal, that's crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighborhood that Mr. Diallo and some of his compatriots settled in is well worn, but well kept. Surrounding streets have multistory apartment buildings, but Mr. Diallo's block, on Wheeler Avenue, consists mostly of two-story brick duplexes, many of which have been turned into apartments. Arches over narrow alleys connect many of the buildings, and the neighbors -- Hispanic, African-American and African -- say they feel connected as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody knows everybody,&quot; Ms. Ortiz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just one block over, on Elder Avenue, the drug dealing was so bad that the police made it a so-called Model Block, which means a constant police presence on the street. The police have the right to cordon off the block and bar nonresidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Elder is only a block away, residents say it might as well be a world.  There is no drug dealing on Wheeler, they say, and they had not heard shots fired in two or three years. Until the night of Mr. Diallo's death, when the blizzard of shots brought the officers stationed on Elder Street running.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For nearly three decades, members of the New York City Police Department's street crimes unit have patrolled the city at night in search of crimes about to occur, sometimes making their appearance scruffy to blend in and driving battered cars as camouflage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been known as an elite force, and became even more so two years ago when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced that the city would nearly quadruple the force and expand its focus from taking illegal guns off the street to fighting a number of crimes, from rape to thefts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, the unit has become a hallmark of the aggressive policing championed by the Giuliani administration and has offered one avenue for active beat officers to advance through the ranks and gain a detective shield. But its tactics have also been criticized by community leaders and other police officers who say the department should rein in the unit's members, who like to say they &quot;own the night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting on Thursday of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an apparently unarmed black peddler who lived in the Bronx, by four white officers in the unit who were looking for a rape suspect, brought harsh complaints not only from Amnesty International but also from associations of minority officers in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are dealing with a critical issue of race in the United States,&quot; said a retired police detective, Graham Weatherspoon, who spoke at a news conference yesterday held by a local officers' group, 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care. &quot;Three years ago, a man with a rifle was arrested in midtown Manhattan without a shot being fired. The man arrested was a male white.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the same news conference, Sidique Abubakarr Wai, the president of the United African Congress, added: &quot;Africans are murdered in this town every month and we are sick and tired of burying our own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The street crimes unit has been called upon through the years to pinpoint and tackle many problems. They have saturated midtown Manhattan to quell crimes of opportunity during New Year's Eve celebrations and have been sent to precincts troubled by rashes of murders, rapes or assaults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, when the unit had only about 100 officers, it was responsible for 20 percent of all arrests of people carrying illegal guns in the city, according to police statistics. Since 1997, when the Mayor increased its ranks to more than 400 -- still less than 2 percent of the entire police force -- the unit has been responsible for nearly 40 percent of all gun arrests annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Commissioner Safir singled out the work of the unit, saying that it had been instrumental in reducing the number of reported shootings to fewer than 1,000 during the first half of 1998, compared with 2,500 in the first half of 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But prosecutors, speaking on the condition of anonymity, have noted that the unit's mission of searching out crimes instead of responding to them had left some of their arrests vulnerable to complaints of unlawful search and seizure. Cases have been thrown out because officers chased suspects without probable cause, only then finding a gun or other illegal item. &quot;They have a reputation as cowboys,&quot; one prosecutor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days ago, a Brooklyn grand jury declined to indict the rapper Russell Jones, known as Ol' Dirty Bastard in the rap group Wu-Tang Clan, on charges that he attempted to murder street crime officers who had stopped his car on a Bedford-Stuyvesant street last month. The officers, who fired on Mr. Jones and another passenger, claimed that the rap performer had fired first, according to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jones said that the officers had merely been frightened by a cell phone he was holding when he was stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury found no evidence that Mr. Jones had fired at the police, and he said on Thursday that he planned to file a lawsuit against the city. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal officials joined a widening city investigation yesterday into the killing of an unarmed West African immigrant by four police officers who fired 41 shots in a ferocious barrage that remained officially unexplained even as controversy over the case spread from City Hall to the streets of the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States Attorney in Manhattan, Mary Jo White, said her office would work closely with the Bronx District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson, in the inquiry into the shooting early Thursday of 22-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by officers who confronted him at the vestibule of his Bronx building. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Ms. White offered no elaboration, legal experts said the early Federal intervention was highly unusual, perhaps intended as public reassurance in an explosive case already drawing comparisons to those of Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant tortured in a Brooklyn station house in 1997, and Anthony Baez, who died in the Bronx after a struggle with Officer Francis X. Livoti in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators were keeping an official silence, and the officers themselves have not yet been questioned.  There were few facts to go on in a case that seemed to crystallize the apprehensions of New York's minority groups over the aggressive police policies of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration. The victim was black and the four officers involved are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an unofficial account was provided in an interview by Stephen Worth, a lawyer who was hired through the auspices of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association to represent the four officers, all members of the Bronx street crimes unit, who were searching for a rapist when the fatal encounter occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Worth quoted the officers as saying they were driving along Wheeler Avenue in an unmarked car when they first saw Mr. Diallo in the vestibule of his building. He was acting suspiciously, they said, and they thought he resembled the sketch of a rapist they were seeking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer did not elaborate on the suspicious behavior, but another person familiar with the officers' account -- all four gave roughly the same story -- said Mr. Diallo appeared to be fumbling with something as he entered the vestibule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is acting strange, he fits the rapist's description in a generic way,&quot; Mr. Worth said. The plainclothes officers got out of their car, he said, approached Mr. Diallo and identified themselves. &quot;Despite repeated identifications and orders to this individual to do certain things, he failed to comply,&quot; Mr. Worth said. He declined to say what the orders were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to his refusal to comply, Mr. Diallo exhibited &quot;aggressive behavior,&quot; which Mr. Worth refused to define. &quot;There may have been a language problem in terms of his understanding their directions,&quot; Mr. Worth acknowledged. Mr. Diallo's roommates said he spoke English well, but slowly and with a stutter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, the officers drew their guns -- each had a 16-shot 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol -- and Mr. Diallo may have made some movement or gesture they took to be threatening, Mr. Worth said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other person familiar with the officers' account quoted them as saying Mr. Diallo, who was carrying only a wallet and a beeper, moved his hands and arms in a way that made the officers think he was going for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Worth said the officers then opened fire because they thought he had a gun. &quot;The reason they are shooting him is they think he has the gun,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the large number of shots fired, Mr. Worth said: &quot;The reason they are given this kind of fire power is to neutralize what they perceive as a threat. While it may seem to a layman to be excessive, it was the number required before this man stopped. All 41 shots did not hit this individual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An autopsy yesterday found that Mr. Diallo suffered 19 gunshot wounds: 1 to the front of the chest, 5 to the left side, 1 to the left back, 1 to the right arm and 11 in the legs. Internal injuries -- ruptures of the aorta, spinal cord, lungs, liver, spleen, kidney and intestines -- caused his death, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the Medical Examiner's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day after the shooting, as the victim's body was taken to a Harlem funeral home to be washed and wrapped to be sent home to Guinea, West Africa, for burial, there were waves of protest and expressions of outrage by relatives and friends of Mr. Diallo, civil rights advocates and human rights organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want justice,&quot; Kyle B. Watters, a lawyer for the victim's family, said outside 1157 Wheeler Avenue, in the Soundview section, where Mr. Diallo was slain. &quot;Ultimately, we want to have these officers prosecuted and convicted and spend the rest of their lives in jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing beside him, the victim's uncle, Mamadou Diallo, wept and said, &quot;I'm too sad to speak.&quot; But the Rev. Al Sharpton, called the killing &quot;the worst form of police brutality we have ever seen or heard of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was not a police murder, this was a police slaughter,&quot; Mr. Sharpton said. He called for a Federal inquiry and spoke of plans for a protest rally tomorrow outside the victim's building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International U.S.A., in a statement, said the slaying &quot;raises deeply troubling questions about the use of excessive force and police brutality,&quot; and called for an independent commission to investigate. The Center for Constitutional Rights urged the appointment of a special prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of an organization called 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care called for a Federal investigation, and contended that the street crimes unit, to which the involved officers belong, was a danger to New Yorkers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is the unit that's been given carte blanche to do as it will to the people of the City of New York, especially the African-American community,&quot; Eric Adams, a city police lieutenant who heads the organization, said. While the unit has existed for years, he said &quot;it has taken a more aggressive stance under this administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mayor Giuliani, who said he welcomed Federal involvement, appealed for calm and patience until the facts were in. He said that the police officers all had good records and that the victim, a street peddler who worked on 14th Street in Manhattan, had no police record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing with Police Commissioner Howard Safir at a City Hall news briefing, the Mayor said, &quot;It obviously troubles both the Police Commissioner and me that 41 shots were fired. We don't know the reason for it at this point, but that is what the investigation is all about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Safir said there were no eyewitnesses to the shooting, other than the four officers. Asked why Mr. Diallo had been approached by the police, he said, &quot;There are some similarities between the individual and the sketch we have,&quot; a reference to a rapist being sought, &quot;but beyond that, what was in their mind, whether they thought this was that individual, is unfair to speculate at this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers -- Edward McMellon, 26, Sean Carroll, 35, Kenneth Boss, 27, and Richard Murphy, 26, all members of a street crimes unit composed of some of the city's most aggressive and decorated officers -- were on administrative leave, and had not been questioned by investigators for their department or the Bronx District Attorney's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, no comment was the official response to the unanswered questions: why an unarmed man with no police record was shot at all, and why so many times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some law enforcement officials said the phenomenon of several officers' firing many shots is sometimes called contagious shooting. In the heat of what one officer believes is a deadly confrontation, the first shots may be justified, but others join in as a kind of contagion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Diallo was, by all accounts, a pious Muslim who had never been in trouble with the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Savage, president of the P.B.A., called the shooting a &quot;terrible tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, &quot;We do not have enough of the facts yet to be able to comment in substance about how it occurred.&quot; He said the officers had not invoked the 48-hour rule, an often misunderstood contract provision that allows those facing departmental charges two business days before talking to investigators. Departmental charges usually are not pursued until after criminal charges are adjudicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding criminal charges, officers, like other citizens, may invoke constitutional rights against self-incrimination. The four officers in this case have not been questioned by police investigators at the behest of the Bronx District Attorney, who appeared to be proceeding cautiously to avoid legal errors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The involvement by the United States Attorney does not mean that Federal officials will take over the investigation, officials said. Rather, Federal officials will consider possible violations of Mr. Diallo's civil rights, while the District Attorney examines criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typically, the Federal Government does not enter a case until later, often only after state prosecutors fail to win a conviction. That is what happened in the case of Officer Livoti, who was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide in 1996, but was convicted last year by Ms. White's office of violating the civil rights of Mr. Baez by killing him with a choke hold banned by the police.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the four plainclothes officers who shot a Bronx man to death early yesterday had been involved in other shootings, one of which is still under investigation, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four officers -- Edward McMellon, 26, Sean Carroll, 35, Kenneth Boss, 27, and Richard Murphy, 26 -- have been placed on administrative duty, a standard department procedure, while the police investigate the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 22, in the vestibule of his Soundview apartment building. The officers, all assigned to the Bronx Street Crimes Unit, an elite and often dangerous assignment, had been looking for a suspect in a series of rapes, the police said. It remained unclear last night why the officers shot at Mr. Diallo, who died in a fusillade of 41 bullets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officer Boss, who has been on the police force for seven years, is under investigation in the October 1997 fatal shooting of a man who the police said was menacing people with a shotgun in front of an apartment building on Sheffield Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the police, Officer Boss shot the man, Pat Baily, after Mr. Baily fled into a nearby apartment building. Although it remains unclear whether Mr. Baily was holding a weapon when he was shot, a shotgun was found next to his body, the police said. Mr. Baily died of his injuries at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting is under investigation by the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, which is trying to &quot;determine whether there are issues that need to be resolved by a grand jury,&quot; said Patrick B. Clark, the spokesman for the office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer McMellon, a five-year police veteran, was cleared after shooting and wounding a man in East New York, Brooklyn, last June. The police said the man had a loaded 9-millimeter handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Carroll, who has also been on the force for five years, was found to have been justified in firing his gun last August on Wilson Avenue in the Bronx. He said that he had fired at a suspect after hearing a bullet pass over his head. Neither a suspect nor any weapons were recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Murphy, like more than 90 percent of all officers on the force, has not been involved in any shootings. In his four years as a police officer, he has never had a complaint against him lodged with the Civilian Complaint Review Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer McMellon has received five complaints, while Officers Boss and Carroll each have received three, said a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official said that none of the complaints, which ranged from accusations of excessive force to abuse of authority and racial insensitivity, had been substantiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Carroll was the only one of the group to have two years experience in the Street Crimes unit, whose members are often asked to search out crimes in progress and to get guns off the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since they joined the unit in October, Officer Murphy has made eight felony arrests, seven of them for gun possession, and Officer Boss has made five gun-possession arrests, one for auto theft and one for narcotics possession. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photographs of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> show a slight, smiling man. In one picture, he is shirtless, flexing his muscles; in another, he wears sunglasses, and jauntily props up a foot on a stoop. Always, the gentle grin is there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those pictures, his family, friends and neighbors said, captured Mr. Diallo's personality. &quot;To say he was nice is not an exaggeration,&quot; his roommate Momodou Kujabi, said. &quot;I would rather it had been me&quot; who was shot, he said. &quot;This guy was better than me.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, in the hours after Mr. Diallo was killed by police gunfire, Mr. Kujabi and other men from Mr. Diallo's native country, Guinea, gathered outside his apartment building in the Soundview section of the Bronx to express quiet outrage and make grim preparations to collect his body, have it washed in the Islamic tradition and send it home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Diallo, 22, emigrated two and half years ago from Guinea, in West Africa. A member of the Fulani ethnic group, he left the village of Lelouma, where much of his family, including his mother, still lives. She was notified yesterday, relatives said. His father was out of the country and could not be reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed Diallo, the president of the Guinean Association of America, said most Guineans were emigrating because of instability in parts of West Africa. Mr. Diallo, who is not related to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said: &quot;A lot of things are happening in Africa, some bad things. Fighting is going on in my country, Sierra Leone, and Guinea Bissau.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was thus following a well-worn path, and he quickly landed in a community of Guineans who had settled in and around the Soundview section. First he lived with his uncle, Mamadou Diallo, on Wheeler Avenue. A year ago, he moved down the street to share an apartment with two cousins, Modousalieu Diallo and Abdou Rahman Diallo, and Mr. Kujabi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five or six months ago, Modousalieu Diallo moved to Detroit, and he returned yesterday, his face grim, to the cramped apartment stuffed with sofas, a large television, a display case for dishware and a poster of Leonardo DiCaprio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three roommates rarely saw each other, because they all worked so many hours, striving to make their way in a new country. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who peddled socks, gloves, videotapes and other goods on 14th Street in Manhattan, usually left each day by noon, and did not return until midnight. &quot;All he did was go to work and come home,&quot; said Abdou, his cousin and roommate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and relatives said that Mr. Diallo had no reason to fear the police and that he was in the country legally. They said he was shy and soft-spoken, that his English was good but he spoke slowly, with a stutter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mamadou Diallo said he thought his nephew also wanted to bring more family members here. &quot;You have a good life here, you need to bring your family,&quot; the uncle said. &quot;I know he had that in mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr. Diallo was not working, he often sat, alone or with friends, out on his stoop; it made him something of a fixture on the block. Each morning, he greeted Barry Jenkins, a neighbor, with a smile. Mr. Jenkins said he had never learned the young man's name, yet he was devastated when he learned it was he who had been killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I ain't never seen him bother nobody,&quot; Mr. Jenkins, 53, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kujabi described his roommate as an avid sports fan who loved soccer and basketball, and had recently decided to support the Knicks instead of the Chicago Bulls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Diallo, a Muslim, always prayed five times a day, Mr. Kujabi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's pious,&quot; he said. Then he added, &quot;It's just an innocent life taken by mistake, or by will.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unarmed West African immigrant with no criminal record was killed early yesterday by four New York City police officers who fired 41 shots at him in the doorway of his Bronx apartment building, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear yesterday why the police officers had opened fire on the man at 12:44 A.M. in the vestibule of his building at 1157 Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview section. The man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Amadou Diallo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 22, who came to America more than two years ago from Guinea and worked as a street peddler in Manhattan, died at the scene, the police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bronx District Attorney's office is investigating the shooting, whose details were still murky last night because there were apparently no civilian witnesses and none of the police officers involved had given statements to investigators. But Inspector Michael Collins, a police spokesman, said that investigators who went to the scene of the shooting did not find a weapon on or near Mr. Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives and neighbors described Mr. Diallo as a shy, hard-working man with a ready smile, a devout Muslim who did not smoke or drink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am very angry,&quot; said his uncle, Mamadou Diallo. &quot;He was a skinny guy. Why would the police shoot somebody of that nature 30 or 40 times? We see the police and we give them all the respect we have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A friend, Demba Sanyang, 39, said: &quot;We have a very undemocratic society back home, and then we come here. We don't expect to be killed by law enforcement officers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four officers involved in the shooting were assigned to the aggressive Street Crimes Unit, which focuses largely on taking illegal guns off the street. All four officers, who were in plainclothes, used their 9-millimeter semiautomatic service pistols, which hold 16 bullets and can discharge all of them in seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the officers, Sean Carroll, 35, and Edward McMellon, 26, emptied their weapons, firing 16 shots each, the police said. Officer Kenneth Boss, 27, fired his gun five times and Officer Richard Murphy, 26, fired four times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four have been put on administrative leave, which is standard practice after a police shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the officers -- Officers Carroll, McMellon and Boss -- have been involved in shootings before, which is unusual in a department where more than 90 percent of all officers never fire their weapons in the line of duty. In those previous incidents, Officers Carroll and McMellon were found to have acted properly, the police said; the case of Officer Boss -- he shot and killed a man said to be armed with a shotgun on Oct. 31, 1997, in Brooklyn -- is still being reviewed by the Brooklyn District Attorney's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police rules on when officers can fire their guns are explicit: deadly force can be used only when officers fear for their lives or the lives of others. But once they decide to shoot, officers are trained to fire until they &quot;stop&quot; the target from causing harm. They are told not to fire warning shots, and to aim for the center of the body, not arms or legs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials said it was unclear whether the circumstances of the confrontation between Mr. Diallo and the officers justified such a shooting. What the police say is known is that the four officers were patrolling Mr. Diallo's neighborhood yesterday morning in an unmarked car in the hope that they would make arrests and in the process turn up information about a serial rapist in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a quarter to one, the officers encountered Mr. Diallo. All four got out of the car and approached him as he stood in the vestibule of his building, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that a neighbor reported after the shooting that he had noticed a man, who the police believe was Mr. Diallo, loitering in the vestibule. The man described him as &quot;acting suspicious,&quot; said the official, who did not elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers did not communicate over their radios before they approached Mr. Diallo, the police said, so investigators said they did not know what prompted their initial interest in him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is it known why the officers began firing. A second police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said, &quot;We don't know what happened, because we haven't spoken to them, but it looks like one guy may have panicked and the rest followed suit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the shooting the officers called in on their radios, the police said, and neighbors telephoned 911. Soon other officers arrived on the scene, followed by detectives and the ranking officers who are required to respond to all police shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An investigation began, and no weapon was found on Mr. Diallo, Inspector Collins said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pager and a wallet were found lying next to the body, a police official said, adding that it was unclear whether the officers could have mistaken the pager for a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Diallo had lived in New York for two and a half years. A member of the Fulani ethnic group, he came from a village called Lelouma and followed relatives who had moved here. He worked as a street peddler, selling socks, gloves and videos on 14th Street in Manhattan. He sent much of the money he earned to his parents back home, friends said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Mr. Diallo arrived home from work around midnight, said his roommate, Momodou Kujabi. The two men discussed who was going to pay the Con Edison bill, and then Mr. Diallo turned on the television and Mr. Kujabi went to bed.  Another roommate, Mr. Diallo's cousin, Abdou Rahman Diallo, was already asleep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kujabi said he thought Mr. Diallo might have gone out for something to eat, as he often did after coming home from work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came the shots, and a knock on the door, he said. It was the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kujabi said that the officers brought him down to the vestibule to identify his friend's body. &quot;I said, 'How can this happen?' &quot; Mr. Kujabi recalled telling the officers. &quot; 'I left this guy less than 30 minutes ago.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An autopsy found that Mr. Diallo died of multiple gunshot wounds to the torso, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the Chief Medical Examiner's Office. Further tests are required to learn how many wounds there were and where the bullets entered his body, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx District Attorney's office, said the shooting was being investigated would probably be taken up by a grand jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stuart London, a lawyer representing the officers, said that he was still trying to determine the facts of the case. &quot;It would be premature to comment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani urged people to withhold judgment on the case. &quot;We've had terrible mistakes in this city when people have reacted to rumors and intuitions and feelings,&quot; he said. &quot;Let's let the situation run its course and then let's react to the facts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kyle Waters, a lawyer representing Mr. Diallo's family, said he was concerned that the police officers may have overreacted to Mr. Diallo. &quot;There was nothing to indicate that he was a criminal, nothing to indicate that he had a weapon,&quot; he said. &quot;For him to be sent back to his homeland in Guinea in a box is a horrible tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Assemblyman Ruben Diaz, who represents the area, called the shooting &quot;outrageous,&quot; adding that it was clear that excessive force was used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Giuliani said the circumstances of the shooting were unclear because the officers involved had invoked what is known as the 48-hour rule, which gives police officers two business days to consult with their union lawyers before they speak to investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But police officials said that was not the case; instead, they said, they have not spoken to the officers because the Bronx District Attorney's office asked them not to. That is common practice in police shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When prosecutors pursue possible criminal charges, police officers, like other citizens, can invoke their right against self-incrimination and decline to talk. The 48-hour rule comes into play when the Police Department pursues possible administrative charges. Officers in such an investigation are required to answer questions after the 48-hour respite, or face dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, relatives began making plans to return the body of Mr. Diallo to his parents in the village of Lelouma. &quot;I think there is no reason to shoot someone more than 30 times,&quot; said Mamadou Diallo.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
