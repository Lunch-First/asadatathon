<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am writing to express an opinion concerning the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was born in the Hill District on Webster Avenue in 1942 and raised among whites, blacks, Italians, Jews, Lebanese and many other nationalities and colors of skin. Everyone seemed to get along with everyone else in those days. I don't remember the vast racial divide I see today. This divide seems to influence everybody's feelings about any court case involving people of different races. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the jury of the Zimmerman case was overwhelmingly white, it brings to mind another famous case in which the jury at that time was primarily black. I'm speaking of the O.J. Simpson murder trial. I can't help but think that the makeup of the jury had something to do with both outcomes. This is just food for thought.</SPAN></P>
