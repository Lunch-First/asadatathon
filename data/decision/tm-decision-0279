<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If nothing else, the vocal talent showcased in &quot;20 Feet From Stardom,&quot; a documentary about backup singers, affords the viewer/listener with a 90-minute Auto-Tune-free zone. For fans of the musical instrument that is the unaltered human voice, it's a rare treat. But it's not just that. The film also is an engaging look at the nexus of art and commerce, talent and hard work. It's a story of standing out and blending in, sometimes at the same time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several musical superstars are interviewed throughout the film by Morgan Neville, a producer and director of music documentaries. Still, Mick Jagger, Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Stevie Wonder and others do more talking here than performing. Oddly, Bette Midler is practically the only woman of their stature to be interviewed by the director, which may say more about the music industry's sexism than Neville. That reading is suggested by another statistic. All of the background singers who are profiled in depth - and who are the movie's real stars - are women: Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer, Judith Hill, Claudia Lennear, Darlene Love and Tata Vega. The distance alluded to in the title, which is taken from a comment made by Springsteen near the beginning of the film, is both literal and metaphorical. The journey from anonymous edge of the stage to the spotlight, he says, &quot;can be a pretty long walk.&quot; As one commentator notes, whenever you sing along with the radio, you're probably singing along with the background vocalist. (PG-13, 90 minutes)  Contains some obscenity and sexual material. At area theaters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Michael O'Sullivan<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rrr THE ATTACK</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Attack&quot; opens like a love story, with a woman telling her husband that every time they separate, &quot;a part of me dies.&quot; In light of what happens next, those words take on another, more ominous meaning. Set in Tel Aviv and the West Bank town of Nablus, the taut but messily honest tale is the story of Amin (Ali Suliman), a prominent Israeli surgeon of secular Palestinian background who wakes up one morning to discover that his beautiful wife, Siham (Reymond Amsalem), has become a suicide bomber, responsible for blowing herself up in a restaurant, along with 17 other victims, including 11 children celebrating a birthday. It's 3 a.m. when Amin gets the call to identify his wife's body, or what's left of it. The grisly fact that there's not much left of Siham from the rib cage down is pretty much all the incriminating evidence that the police need. That doesn't stop Amin from believing that there must be some mistake. As it becomes increasingly obvious that the mistake was his - in overlooking whatever clues there may have been to Siham's secret life as a Palestinian terrorist - he sets out to find answers to a difficult question, as he frames it: &quot;How do you make a fundamentalist monster out of a woman who wouldn't hurt a fly?&quot; The search takes Amin briefly to Nazareth, where his wife was from, and then to Nablus, where she spent the last night of her life. What he ends up finding along the way are more questions. (R, 102 minutes) Contains some grisly images, obscenity, brief nudity and sensuality. In Hebrew and Arabic with subtitles.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Linklater made his name in 1991 with &quot;Slacker,&quot; a low-key, discursive ramble through Austin that introduced a new generation and a spontaneous form of filmmaking that concealed surprising intelligence and artfulness beneath its laid-back style. Linklater has gone on to pursue a wonderfully eclectic career, hopping from sci-fi animation (&quot;Waking Life&quot;) to family-friendly comedies (&quot;School of Rock&quot;) with easygoing finesse. But now and then he returns to the talky, elliptical movie he started out making: In 1995, he made &quot;Before Sunrise,&quot; starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as Jesse and Celine, two people in their 20s who meet on a train and spend a romantic night having one long conversation while strolling through Vienna; in 2004 he caught up with the couple in &quot;Before Sunset,&quot; when they meet again a decade later. With luck, Linklater isn't bringing the couple's story to an end with &quot;Before Midnight&quot; - I, for one, can't wait to see Jesse and Celine confront their later years in &quot;Before I Have to Get Up and Pee Again.&quot; But there's no doubt that &quot;Before Midnight,&quot; which finds the young lovers of yore firmly ensconced within the regret and compromise of middle age, also finds them grappling with intimations of aging and mortality. Jesse and Celine still tease, seduce, wind each other up and prattle on with the same verve, but there's an autumnal whiff to even their sunniest repartee. (R, 108 minutes) Contains sexual content, nudity and profanity. At area theaters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Ann Hornaday<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rr BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A biopic gets the Bollywood treatment in &quot;Bhaag Milkha Bhaag&quot; (&quot;Run Milkha Run&quot;), which dramatizes the life of record-breaking Indian sprinter Milkha Singh, played by the talented Farhan Akhtar. The movie begins in 1960 with Milkha's failed attempt at securing a medal during the Rome Olympics. Despondent, he tries to withdraw from a government-orchestrated race in Pakistan. One of the organizers can't comprehend why Milkha would quit, but the runner's coach explains (complete with sorrowful music) that the young man has personal reasons. Naturally, the government official asks for further explanation. And, boy, does he get an answer. There is a short version: As a child, Milkha's family was killed in front of him after the 1947 partition landed his Sikh village on the Pakistani side of the border. But the coach weaves an epic tale instead, and his hyper-detoured response, full of tales of first love and youthful troublemaking, lasts about twice as long as it should. Some of the stories offer a bit of comedy, a chance to stage a requisite Bollywood musical number or offer some insight into Milkha's personality. There is a sweet subplot involving the beloved sister that raised him and some lively comic relief from his early days in the military (amusingly, the setting for the film's most memorable song-and-dance number). The movie also spotlights the exuberant moment Milkha first discovered competitive running. Like most Bollywood films, Milkha's story is supposed to be a saga. But aside from a horrifying experience in childhood and some major triumphs on the track, much of the rest of his history feels like filler held together by a faulty framing device. (Unrated, 188 minutes) Contains sexual situations and violence. In Hindi with English subtitles. At Regal Countryside 20. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Stephanie Merry<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rrr THE CONJURING</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Conjuring&quot; is one heck of a ghost story. Based on the highly scientific DLPG scale - measured by the number of times I looked over my shoulder as I hurried through a Dimly Lit Parking Garage after the movie - it's a well-above-average thriller. If it isn't quite up there with such classics of the genre as &quot;The Haunting&quot; (1963 version, please) or &quot;The Others,&quot; it isn't far behind. Set in 1971, the story is said to have been inspired by the files of Ed and Lorraine Warren, a husband-and-wife team of paranormal investigators. The action takes place in a 150-year-old Rhode Island farmhouse, where, almost immediately upon moving in, Roger and Carolyn Perron (Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor) and their five daughters start to experience disturbing events. First the dog won't come inside. Then there's a foul odor, followed by unexplained cold spots, clocks that stop at 3:07 a.m. and miscellaneous visits by things that go bump in the night. Thankfully, there are no bleeding walls, though the movie does bear an obvious debt of gratitude to &quot;The Amityville Horror,&quot; the real-life setting of which was also, coincidentally, investigated by the Warrens. When things get out of control one night - about the time a female poltergeist tries to body slam one of the daughters from the top of a haunted antique wardrobe - the Perrons invite the Warrens over to have a look-see. As played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, the Warrens bring a sort of deadpan credibility to the admittedly far-fetched goings-on. (R, 112 minutes) Contains intense scenes of terror and violence. At area theaters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-M.O.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rrr DESPICABLE ME 2</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minions are back. The little yellow torpedoes warmed hearts when they shuffled into 2010's animated hit &quot;Despicable Me&quot; with the bounciness of a beach ball, the elasticity of a rubber band and a vernacular composed mostly of giggles. Once again, they manage to tickle moviegoers big and small in the way only cat videos usually do, and they very nearly run off with the sequel, &quot;Despicable Me 2.&quot; But the sweet story holds its own. The Russian-accented Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is a very different villain than when we last saw him. He has traded in a life of crime, including moon thievery and other high jinks, for a more sedate occupation. Gru, his accomplice Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) and the minions spend their days making jam, and Gru passes his evenings taking care of his adopted trio of daughters, Margo, Edith and Agnes. His biggest stressors are planning Agnes's birthday party and coming to grips with Margo's interest in boys. But this homey existence is shaken when agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig) of the Anti-Villain League drops in with a lipstick taser and a plan to recruit the reformed bad guy. It seems that an under-the-radar supervillain has used a giant magnet to make off with an entire laboratory that housed a gooey substance capable of transforming people, animals and minions into purple snaggletoothed monsters that eat everything in sight. The league has tracked the supervillain to a mall, and they need Gru to embed himself deep within the concrete jungle to discern which of the store owners is responsible. Gru agrees to take on the gig, although he's hardly thrilled to be joined by Lucy as his new partner. (PG, 98 minutes) Contains rude humor and mild action. 98 minutes. At area theaters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- S.M.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rr &Acirc;&frac12; EPIC</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In calling itself &quot;Epic,&quot; the new CGI adventure based on children's author and illustrator William Joyce's &quot;The Leaf Men&quot; might be guilty of overselling itself, just a bit. Yes, the movie is certainly more swollen in scope and tone than Joyce's eco-themed picture book on which it's (very loosely) based. That 2001 story of the secret, teeming life of a garden had a charm similar to the author's earlier &quot;George Shrinks,&quot; in that both books derived much of their enchantment from imagining what the world looks like if you're only an inch tall. Yet this film, on which Joyce worked as producer, writer and production designer, retains enough of the magic of the original to make it enormously visually appealing, even if the story itself is almost unrecognizably bloated. As in the book, the Leafmen are a race of bug-size soldiers who maintain the order and balance of the natural world. Riding saddled hummingbirds, they keep the forces of decay and rot - embodied by creatures known as the Boggans - at bay. But when Mandrake (voice of Christoph Waltz), the evil leader of the Boggans, attacks the Leafmen's queen (Beyonc Knowles) and steals the magical flower bud containing the soul of her replacement, the Leafmen must fight to get it back before its power is perverted into poisoning all life. (PG, 110 minutes) Contains cartoon violence, peril and death. At University Mall Theatre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-M.O.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rrrr FRANCES HA</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If &quot;Frances Ha&quot; is what nepotism looks like, let's hear it for family trees. Consider: The writer-director of this small, gemlike coming-of-age comedy is Noah Baumbach, son of former Village Voice film critic Georgia Brown and author Jonathan Baumbach. Three of its most arresting supporting players - Mickey Sumner, Grace Gummer and Charlotte D'Amboise - are the daughters of Sting, Meryl Streep and ballet superstar Jacques D'Amboise, respectively. Not to be outdone, the incandescent star of &quot;Frances Ha,&quot; Greta Gerwig, casts her own parents as her character's mom and dad, roles they play with a bracing lack of self-consciousness or patronizing irony in a movie set squarely in that fraught nether-region between arrested adolescence and adulthood. Who knows what other showbiz skeletons are hiding in the closets of the superior ensemble cast? And who cares? Writing with Gerwig, Baumbach has created a fey, sneakily charming generational touchstone on a par with &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and his own Gen Y comedy &quot;Kicking and Screaming.&quot; And he has created a spectacular showcase for Gerwig, a creaturely, almost feral sprite whose instincts and born-ready camera presence have long been staples of hand-made indie productions, but have yet to find their rightful purchase in mainstream Hollywood. (R, 86 minutes) Contains sexual references and profanity. At AMC Loews Shirlington 7 and Landmark Bethesda Row Cinema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A.H.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rrrr FRUITVALE STATION</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; the astonishing directorial debut of 27-year-old Ryan Coogler, arrives in Washington with considerable wind at its back: Not only did this somber, meticulously constructed urban drama win big awards at the Sundance and Cannes film festivals, but its story - about an unarmed young man who was shot and killed in Oakland in the early hours of New Year's Day 2009 - has uncannily intersected with the recent verdict regarding the death of Trayvon Martin. The cable crawl-ready provenance of &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; makes it a topical film, no doubt. But what makes it a must-see is its timelessness: Coogler, who began writing the script as a film student at USC, brings not just classical aesthetic sensibilities to the tale of Oscar Grant but an unerring ethical stance, as well. In this absorbing, finally devastating portrait of a 22-year-old man struggling with a troubled past and cut down before he can build a future, Coogler never lets emotion be overpowered by emotionalism: In naturalistic and unforced strokes, he allows Grant to exist as a complex, even contradictory human, inviting the audience simply to sit with his life, his loss and what they both meant.&quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; begins with images many viewers will be familiar with: shaky cellphone footage of Grant's encounter with Oakland transit police who had detained him and some friends after an altercation on a train. Coogler then cuts to several hours earlier, when Grant - portrayed in an impressively mercurial performance by &quot;The Wire's&quot; Michael B. Jordan - is making New Year's resolutions with his girlfriend, Sophina (Melonie Diaz), and vowing to do better. (R, 84 minutes) Contains some violence, profanity throughout and some drug use.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A.H.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rr GIRL MOST LIKELY</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kristen Wiig delivers another spaced-out star turn in &quot;Girl Most Likely,&quot; a picaresque romance of self-discovery that delivers a near-constant flow of small delights until veering too far into screwball preposterousness. Wiig plays Imogene, who's introduced in a prologue as a precocious young actress who, when she's uttering the line &quot;There's no place like home&quot; in &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; turns to the director to say, &quot;This just isn't working for me.&quot; Flash forward 20 years and the grown-up Imogene is an aspiring playwright whose early ambition has been thwarted by the comfort and distraction offered by her wealthy boyfriend. In its bravura opening sequence - filmed entirely from Imogene's point of view - we hear only Wiig's voice as her character leaves a series of voicemails for her errant beau as she makes her way into a snooty Manhattan fundraiser. By the time the camera finally reveals Wiig's face in a powder room mirror, her carefully made-up expression of self-deception and defeat speaks volumes. Eventually, events transpire to send Imogene back home to Ocean City, N.J., a place she has been running from all her adult life and where she's now forced to live with her mother, Zelda (Annette Bening), a compulsive gambler; her troubled but sweet brother, Ralph (Christopher Fitzgerald); and her mom's boyfriend, George (Matt Dillon), who insists he's in the CIA and has a coffee mug to prove it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A.H.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">r &Acirc;&frac12;  GROWN UPS 2</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly every Adam Sandler movie seems to provoke handwringing over whether he's living up to his potential. He's capable of portraying nuanced characters, as he did in &quot;Funny People&quot; and &quot;Punch-Drunk Love,&quot; but he's clearly happy to settle for his go-to routine of acting like a child and spewing lazy jokes that include his comic holy trinity: bodily fluids, flatulence and ogling scantily-clad women. The shtick must be rote by now, and, indeed, &quot;Grown Ups 2&quot; appears to have been made while engaging as few brain cells as possible. The movie revisits the group of longtime friends that made &quot;Grown Ups&quot; a hit in 2010, bringing in $162 million at the domestic box office. That impressive, if depressing, sum shows the hunger for senseless summer comedies. But &quot;Grown Ups 2&quot; isn't merely mindless. At times it seems to actually drain IQ points from its viewers while wasting a talented cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alums, all of whom are capable of being much smarter and so much funnier.The film follows four men (Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock and David Spade) over a single day as the quartet plans a 1980s-themed summer kickoff party. But every man also gets his own story line, each of which seems plucked from a bad sitcom. Sandler's Lenny is dealing with the fact that Roxanne (Salma Hayek) wants another baby; Kurt (Rock) gets to lord over Deanne (Maya Rudolph) that he remembered their anniversary and she didn't; Eric (James) has to hide frequent trips to his mom's house from Sally (Maria Bello); and Spade's Marcus finds out he fathered a son, who happens to be a tattooed teenage thug. All these threads, plus many more involving the younger generation's love lives, math deficiencies, sports aspirations, broken bones, dirty diapers and bullying, vie for attention over the course of the relatively short run time. (PG-13,101 minutes) Contains crude material, language and bare backsides. At area theaters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- S.M.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">r &Acirc;&frac12; THE HEAT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team of Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy looks on paper to be a sure-fire formula for comic gold; both gifted comediennes, they possess temperaments and physical packages diametrically opposed enough to recreate the kind of comedy made famous by such duos as Abbott and Costello or Jackie Gleason and Art Carney. In &quot;The Heat,&quot; they play mismatched law enforcement officers who bicker and bumble their way into solving a crime and finding a friend. The conceit of the film, which was written by Katie Dippold and directed by Paul Feig - who directed McCarthy to sudden stardom in &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; - is that for all their differences, both share an essential loneliness that has kept them isolated and miserable. That sad subtext gives much of the humor in &quot;The Heat&quot; a melancholy edge, especially when it comes to McCarthy, who once again is forced into a role that asks little more of her than swearing like a stevedore and subjecting herself to undignified slapstick centered around her generous figure. Bullock plays McCarthy's opposite number: uptight, put-together and prim, so you know going in that &quot;The Heat&quot; will feature at least one drunken girl-bonding montage, which in this case arrives almost as a random, perfunctory insert. Seen through one lens, &quot;The Heat&quot; is the product of a cheering trend in female-centered comedies, a feminist sister under the skin to &quot;Bridesmaids.&quot; Seen through another, it revolves around the retrograde novelty of watching women swagger, spout vulgarities, brandish guns and toss around references to their vaginas (not to mention the odd areola and cervix). (R, 117 minutes)  Contains pervasive profanity, strong crude content and some violence. At area theaters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A.H.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">&Acirc;&frac12; star  I'M SO EXCITED</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm So Excited,&quot; Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar's strange and confounding new sex farce, plays like a recruitment video for the Mile High Club produced by the team behind &quot;Airplane!,&quot; but with all the jokes removed. Despite its plentiful and playful sexuality, this dose of Spanish fly is anything but exciting. The director should have stuck with the original Spanish title: &quot;Los Amantes Pasajeros.&quot; At least that phrase, which can be translated either as &quot;The Passenger Lovers&quot; or &quot;The Temporary Lovers,&quot; is a more accurate plot synopsis. Set mostly in the first-class section of an airliner en route from Spain to Mexico, the film consists of an alternating series of random conversations and random sexual couplings among a rogue's gallery of would-be colorful characters. Unfortunately, none of them is the least bit interesting. Almodovar's failure to arouse even perfunctory engagement with the story is almost incomprehensible, considering that, on paper at least, the film sounds totally wild. Let's start with the married, bisexual airplane captain, Alex (Antonio de la Torre). He and his boyfriend, head steward Joserra (Javier Camara), are having sex in the restroom when Joserra is not tossing back shots of tequila or leading the other two gay flight attendants in a campy, lip-synced dance number choreographed to the titular Pointer Sisters hit. The word &quot;marecon&quot; (a Spanish slur for homosexual) gets tossed around with great frequency in the unfunny script by Almodovar, who is gay. The most charitable interpretation of &quot;I'm So Excited&quot; is that it's meant as an expansive celebration of human sexuality in the face of our own mortality. Instead, the airplane it takes place on feels like a flying sardine can stuffed with cold, dead fish. (R, 95 minutes) Contains sex, obscenity and crude humor. In Spanish with subtitles.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain&quot; essentially repackages one of the comedian's sold-out stand-up sets at Madison Square Garden, so there's an understandable compulsion to want to dislike the movie. It feels like a shameless cash grab, especially in light of the fact that, as the film helpfully relays, Hart greeted capacity crowds at huge concert halls everywhere from Oslo to Vancouver during his 2012 tour. What's next? A Kevin Hart action figure - a tiny plastic doppelganger holding a microphone and shouting obscenities at the push of a button? And yet, there's a reason for all the ticket sales (not to mention the movie roles, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; hosting duties and &quot;Real Husbands of Hollywood&quot; gig): Hart is difficult to dislike. Diminutive and energetic, he exudes comedy with every spirited step and elaborate gesture. He's hilarious, but almost as important, he's self-aware enough to joke about his own shortcomings, which makes appreciating &quot;Let Me Explain&quot; so much easier. As an appetizer to his stand-up set, the movie starts with a fictional scene in which Hart throws a big party. But instead of enjoying the evening, the comic is met with a steady stream of outlandish questions stemming from Hollywood gossip. That's the idea behind &quot;Let Me Explain&quot;: Hart is here to set the record straight. The nasty divorce? It was amicable. His aversion to dark-skinned women? A myth. But just when it starts sounding like Hart is preparing to saddle up his high horse, he admits that the drunken-driving arrest did in fact happen, and there's no good way to talk his way out of that one.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's an article of faith in a movie industry obsessed with chasing multiple demographic groups that no summer blockbuster can be only one thing. &quot;White House Down&quot; can't be just an action adventure; it has to be a buddy comedy. &quot;Man of Steel&quot; isn't only a science-fiction comic book movie; it's a violence-heavy, special-effects spectacle. &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; isn't just a special-effects spectacle; it has to have a little romance. &quot;The Lone Ranger,&quot; starring Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp, presents audiences with a case not just of &quot;both&quot; but &quot;all of the above.&quot; A draggy reboot of the franchise Western that started as a radio series before it became a movie serial and a hit television show, this mishmash of styles, genres and tonal shifts makes for a dizzying pastiche best described in terms of the many movies it references throughout its nearly 21 / 2-hour running time, from &quot;Little Big Man,&quot; Buster Keaton's &quot;The General&quot; and the Monument Valley-set canon of John Ford to &quot;Dead Man,&quot; &quot;Rango&quot; and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean.&quot; Those last three, of course, starred Depp himself. And it turns out that &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; may best be understood and appreciated as one long, baggy homage to Depp, who addresses the myriad personae that have made him the world's biggest movie star, especially the tattooed, bejeweled bohemian primitive that defines his off-screen look as well as the punched-up version when he plays Jack Sparrow. As Tonto, the Lone Ranger's perennially stoic and monosyllabic sidekick, Depp both challenges and indulges in the caricatures that made Jay Silverheels's TV character such a lightning rod for Native American outrage.(PG-13, 149 minutes) Contains sequences of intense action and violence, and some suggestive material.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newly minted superstar Henry Cavill makes a well-built, handsomely credible Superman in &quot;Man of Steel&quot; - or at least he will, in an already-planned sequel that, with luck, will more thoughtfully exploit his talents. For now, audiences can only speculate as to the hidden depths of Cavill, who in Zack Snyder's busy, bombastic creation myth is reduced to little more than a joyless cipher or dazzling physical specimen. Produced by Christopher Nolan, who brought such grim self-seriousness to the &quot;Batman&quot; franchise, &quot;Man of Steel&quot; clearly seeks the same brand of grandiose gravitas. But that dour tone turns out to be far more appropriate for a tortured hero brooding in his cave than for an all-American alien who is as much a product of the wholesome windswept Plains as a distant planet called Krypton. Snyder and his writer, David S. Goyer, accentuate Superman's intergalactic provenance in &quot;Man of Steel,&quot; which opens on Krypton just as the planet is crumbling, the rogue General Zod (an alarmingly skeletal Michael Shannon) is threatening a coup and the wise scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) is sending his infant son Kal-El into the cosmos in order to begin the world over again. Seeking to cram as much back story as possible into a movie that feels like a reboot, prequel and creation myth all in one, Snyder and Goyer then leap forward to a time when Kal - now an adult earthling named Clark Kent - is working on a fishing boat, haunted by an unnamed past and once in a while jumping into the water to save a crew from a burning rig with his superhuman strength.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pixar has a pretty solid track record when it comes to sequels. Like the Energizer Bunny, &quot;Toy Story&quot; just keeps going and going, with a fourth chapter of the hit franchise said to be in development. But until &quot;Monsters University,&quot; a new origin story set several years before the action of &quot;Monsters, Inc.,&quot; the acclaimed animation shop had never attempted a prequel. You wonder what took them so long, because the characters Mike (voice of Billy Crystal) and Sulley (John Goodman) are funny enough and their relationship rich enough to make the back story worth telling. Set at the titular Monsters University, the film is the story of how freshmen monsters Mike and Sulley - aspiring students of the fine art of scaring - met and became fast friends. It's also the story of how they became, more essentially, themselves. Where &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; was a heavily plot-driven tale, &quot;Monsters University&quot; is a two-man, er, two-monster, character study. Monsters University gets underway when Mike, the tiny, cyclopean, chartreuse-skinned cueball, and Sulley, the jumbo-size, furry blue beast, are both kicked out of the scaring department at M.U., where they've enrolled to learn how to make kids scream. In order to get back into the scaring program, Mike and Sulley are forced to team with a fraternity of losers to compete in the Scare Games, a campus-wide competition. If they win, they'll be accepted back in the department. If they lose, they're not just out of the department, but out of the school for good. It may be children's terror that powers the movie's fictional universe, but it's the energy of its stars that lights up &quot;Monsters University.&quot; (G, 103 minutes) Contains brief, mild spookiness.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feints, schemes, deceptions and setbacks that inevitably lead to love make for a divertingly merry war in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing,&quot; Joss Whedon's larky DIY adaptation of Shakespeare's play. Transposing the manners and verbal flourishes of Elizabethan England to 21st-century Santa Monica, Calif., Whedon finds unexpected meaning in this famously saucy &quot;skirmish of wit,&quot; the opposites-attract story upon which myriad modern-day rom-coms have sprung. Not only does the spiky verbal sparring between would-be lovers Beatrice and Benedick still crackle with convincing sting and verve, but Shakespeare also turns out to have plenty to say about an era when, more than ever, someone is more apt to be destroyed by fast-moving rumors and strategic leaks than by an act of brute physical aggression. As the story opens, the brave and accomplished officer Benedick (Alexis Denisof) is just arriving at the home of governor Leonato (Clark Gregg), whose daughter Hero (Jillian Morgese) soon comes into the sights of Benedick's comrade-in-arms, Claudio (Fran Kranz). While Benedick is being lionized for his courage and smooth ways with the ladies, Hero's sharp-tongued cousin Beatrice (Amy Acker) is having none of it. With &quot;Much Ado About Nothing,&quot; Whedon has crafted an endearing bagatelle, made with equal parts brio and love, ambition and pared-down modesty.

McConaughey's low-key comeback continues with &quot;Mud,&quot; in which he plays the title character as a modern-day cross between Boo Radley and Robert Mitchum's Max Cady. As the slippery central figure of Jeff Nichols's richly observed coming-of-age fable, McConaughey injects a note of danger into a bayou noir story of youthful adventure that manages to be lyrical and sobering at the same time. Aided by extraordinarily assured performances from young co-stars Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland, McConaughey defines his own version of a familiar Southern character - the frightening Other who can strangle as easily as save - as an enduring archetype rather than irritating stereotype. Simple values - hard work, honesty, trust, basic decency - inform everything about &quot;Mud,&quot; from its story to its aesthetic. That simplicity makes Nichols's film something of the anti-&quot;Beasts of the Southern Wild,&quot; last year's art-house darling that depicted a similar world and its marginal figures with stylized - and troubling - exoticism.

Only a filmmaker of his supreme self-confidence is willing to put one of the most charismatic stars on the planet in his movie and then reduce his leading man's face to an unrecognizable mess by the film's end. The swollen, bloodied features in question belong to Ryan Gosling, who in &quot;Only God Forgives&quot; hands out and receives beatings with such metronomic regularity that they feel like the big dance numbers in bad musicals: showy, artificial and meaningless. In some ways, &quot;Only God Forgives&quot; qualifies as a follow-up to Refn's 2011 film, &quot;Drive,&quot; which starred Gosling in a similarly terse, somber performance. But where that film cleverly addressed its own pulp-crime genre and the artifice of Hollywood, here Refn advances nothing but his own obsessions, which quickly grow tiresome. He has often proudly declared himself to be a &quot;fetish filmmaker,&quot; interested in making movies purely on the basis of what attracts him. The problem with fetish filmmakers is that they're only interested in pleasing themselves; the audience, for its part, doesn't figure. Presumably, &quot;Only God Forgives&quot; will manage to find its share of dedicated viewers - in this case, people turned on by lurid, neon-colored nightscapes, Asian martial arts, graphic brutality, body horror and the perverse thrill of hearing English rose Kristin Scott Thomas deliver arias of vulgar verbal abuse.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pacific Rim&quot; is a big, lumbering, rock 'em, sock 'em mash-up of metallic heft and hyperbole, a noisy, overproduced disaster flick that sucks its characters and the audience down a vortex of garish visual effects and risibly cartoonish action. And you know what? It's not bad! Leave it to Guillermo del Toro - that overgrown fanboy with a heart of gold and a mind of impressive philosophical complexity - to bring some sense and sensibility to this summer's crop of dumb spectacles. &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; will never qualify as part of the director's high-end oeuvre - &quot;Pan's Labyrinth,&quot; it most decidedly ain't. But as an example of del Toro's abiding love for comic books, pop culture and movie genre excess, it ranks with his less intellectual but equally imaginative efforts, maybe somewhere between &quot;Blade II&quot; and the gloriously bodacious &quot;Hellboy.&quot; In fact, &quot;Hellboy's&quot; mordant star, Ron Perlman, shows up for a cameo in &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; as a black marketeer working Hong Kong's neon-noir byways. It's in that port city, sometime in the future, that an apocalyptic invasion of sea creatures called Kaiju will or won't be repelled by a ragtag army of Jaegers, 25-story robots that look like super-size versions of Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man, right down to the whirring mechanical hearts that glow in their tungsten-clad chests.&quot;Iron Man&quot; isn't the only movie &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; conjures in the course of its overlong running time. The central standoff between fantastical creatures bears echoes of &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla,&quot; as well as the anime classics that del Toro has cited as inspirations. The visual design recalls &quot;TRON,&quot; some plot elements recall &quot;Inception,&quot; the crunching action recalls &quot;Transformers&quot; and the relationships recall &quot;Top Gun,&quot; wherein a group of cocky flyboys try to one-up each other in the name of saving the world.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Red,&quot; the 2010 sleeper hit and graphic novel adaptation, felt refreshing. Not only were the movie's heroes all older than 50, but the action-comedy paid as much attention to the comedy as to the action, and the result was effervescently fun. Sequels are, for the most part, inherently stale, so it's no shock that the luster has faded in &quot;Red 2.&quot; The bigger surprise is just how clunky and unsatisfying this follow-up feels. As the movie opens, CIA retiree Frank (Bruce Willis) has returned to the quiet life, shopping at Costco with his girlfriend, Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker). As he attempts to embrace the joys of the 'burbs while searching for giant bags of shrimp, she's despondent, staring at an elderly couple wrangling a jumbo pack of toilet paper. She craves adventure. Luckily, Frank's quirky former partner, the conspiracy theorist Marvin (John Malkovich), appears with a new plan in mind. The trio ends up traveling to Paris, Moscow and London trying to discern the meaning of Operation Nightshade. Frank and Marvin have been accused of spearheading the deadly mission, even though they know nothing about it. New enemies have cropped up to take the three heroes down, including the world's best contract killer, Han (Byung-hun Lee), the sadistic Jack (Neal McDonough) and even their old friend Victoria (Helen Mirren). To spice things up, Catherine Zeta-Jones materializes to play Katja, Frank's ex-paramour. And Anthony Hopkins shows up in the role of an institutionalized scientist who may be the key to the Nightshade puzzle.The plot is fairly busy, given that it feels like an afterthought. The point of the movie is action, and it's all here: shootouts, car chases, shootouts during car chases, hand-to-hand combat, helicopter crashes, bomb explosions and death by paper crane.

Ryan Reynolds plays Nick, the newbie, and Jeff Bridges takes the role of his partner, Roy, in the Rest in Peace Department. They meet when Nick is sucked into a CGI vortex just after his evil partner, Bobby (Kevin Bacon, playing the caricature of a villain), offs him. Up until this point - meaning the first few minutes of the movie - Reynolds does what he does best, which is toss off sardonic one-liners. But as soon as Nick meets his new partner, it's clear this is going to be the Roy Show. The problem is that Roy is not nearly as funny as the movie's writers think he is. Most of the time, he simply laments how coyotes and vultures snacked on his dead body and pulled his bones into a cave after he bit the dust back in the 1800s. Talk about a laugh riot. There is also some sense that director Robert Schwentke told Bridges to do an imitation of himself portraying Rooster Cogburn in &quot;True Grit.&quot; With the exception of the eye patch, the resemblance is uncanny, as is the garbled lilt.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nervy reboot of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise by action impresario J.J. Abrams can be summed up as a triumph of casting. From the moment Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana showed up in Abrams's &quot;Star Trek&quot; four years ago, it was clear he had found exactly the right actors to portray Capt. James Kirk, First Officer Spock and Communications Officer Uhura in their years as Starfleet rookies. Bright, bold, playful and ingenious, Abrams's prequel to the classic 1960s television show (and subsequent film series) possessed equal amounts of respect and cheek. But mostly it boasted an ensemble of superb young actors who, with every raised eyebrow and vocal inflection, inhabited their characters with uncanny ease and seamless physical mimicry. With &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness,&quot; Abrams proves he's still got the golden touch. The USS Enterprise crew is back - including ship doctor &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy (Karl Urban), chief engineer Scotty (Simon Pegg), Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and Sulu (John Cho). But the casting coup here is Benedict Cumberbatch, who exudes steely resolve and silken savagery as a villain on the cusp of becoming a legendary nemesis. Familiar to fans of another reboot - &quot;Sherlock&quot; - as well as such tony historical productions as &quot;War Horse&quot; and &quot;Atonement,&quot; here Cumberbatch claims a deserved place front and center in a big, brash popcorn movie. As gratifying as it is to watch Kirk, Spock and their colleagues develop the camaraderie that would so optimistically anticipate a multicultural world, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; derives its ballast, and most of its menacing pleasure, from Cumberbatch, who takes tantalizing ownership of a role with near-limitless future prospects for evil mayhem.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the Academy Award-winning &quot;Amour,&quot; &quot;Still Mine&quot; is a love story in which the protagonists are, refreshingly, not hard-bodied Hollywood hotties. The surprisingly moving but clear-eyed Canadian film about a couple in their 80s even shows us, if only briefly, the wrinkled naked flesh of its stars, James Cromwell and Genevieve Bujold, playing a long-married couple who are still physically intimate. It's nice to be reminded of what old people look like, since they are, at least in movies these days, ever more invisible. Based on a true story, the film by writer-director Michael McGowan (&quot;Saint Ralph&quot;) is structured around the efforts of Craig Morrison (Cromwell) to build a more manageable house for his increasingly forgetful wife, Irene (Bujold), after she falls and breaks her hip. Craig, a laconic, can-do farmer in rural New Brunswick, runs afoul of the local bureaucracy when he tries to build the home himself, without plans and with unapproved lumber he has milled. On one level, it's a David-and-Goliath tale of conflict. On one side is a stubbornly old-fashioned man; on the other is the modern system, represented by an equally stubborn building inspector (Jonathan Potts), who keeps trying to shut down Craig's little project for code violations, each of which Craig tries to address with the help of his lawyer (Campbell Scott) and his engineer grandson (Zachary Bennett). Eventually, the legal and technical obstacles start seeming more personal than professional.At this point, Craig rises up in anger as the hero we've been waiting for him to become to fight the system. It's a familiar role. (PG-13, 103 minutes) Contains mild crude language, brief nudity and sensuality. At Avalon and Cinema Arts Theatre.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Polley begins her documentary, &quot;Stories We Tell,&quot; with an epigram from Canadian author Margaret Atwood. But this rich, sensitive, densely layered piece of poetic nonfiction also conjures a famous aphorism of William Faulkner: &quot;The past is never dead. It's not even past.&quot; Polley, an actress who has pursued an accomplished directing career with the fictional features &quot;Away From Her&quot; and &quot;Take This Waltz,&quot; brings the past to vivid, astonishing life in &quot;Stories We Tell,&quot; an excavation of her own family that hinges on a long-buried secret, how it's reverberated with everyone it's touched and the contentious ways they explain it. Sitting her four funny, smart, attractive siblings down for talking-head interviews, Polley makes a simple request: Tell the story from beginning to right now, in your own words. They do, and thanks to their observant storytelling and Polley's judicious editing, what unfolds is a riveting drama. Held together by a memoir written and narrated by Polley's father, Michael, &quot;Stories We Tell&quot; begins in the 1960s, when he and her mother, Diane, met and fell in love while doing a play. Looking back, he says, he realizes that Diane - an outgoing, charismatic actress who appeared frequently on Toronto television - probably fell in love with his dashing, intrepid character. Using home movies and original material filmed on vintage-looking Super-8, Polley creates a vibrant tapestry of the facades and false assumptions that form the captivating subtext of &quot;Stories We Tell,&quot; which is nominally about the mysteries left in the wake of Diane's death when Polley was 11.

It's got a drag race. Nitrous oxide pumps through its plot. Michelle Rodriguez, Diesel's recently resurrected girlfriend from the &quot;Fast&quot; flicks, even provides one of the voices. But really, &quot;Turbo&quot; feels more like a hybrid of Pixar's &quot;Cars&quot; and every family-friendly tale, from &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot; to &quot;Monsters University,&quot; that champions the outsize dreams of underdog underachievers. None of which, by the way, detracts from its charms. &quot;Turbo&quot; is a derivative but nevertheless good-hearted movie that's peppered with enough clever touches to engage adults as well as moviegoers of the smaller, squirmier variety. And during a season when moms, dads and nannies often struggle to keep kids occupied, there's something to be said for having an entertaining alternative to seeing &quot;Despicable Me 2&quot; for the fourth time. The star of this show is Theo (voice of Ryan Reynolds), a snail with his shell in the dirt but his itty-bitty, gelatinous head in the clouds. Theo is obsessed with auto racing and determined - against all odds, logic and the persistent naysaying of his older brother, Chet (Paul Giamatti) - to compete in a legitimate speedway event. His wish steers closer to reality after he's snatched from his garden home by a crow and dropped on a sports car in mid-street-race, where he gets injected with enough nitro to make him worthy of a segment on &quot;Top Gear.&quot; (PG, 96 minutes) Contains some mild action and thematic elements.

How dare he. And yet, these unmistakable manipulations are difficult to see through all the tears. Thank the two leads, Terence Stamp and Vanessa Redgrave, for that. The formidably talented duo inject so much humanity into their characters that all of the other overly sentimental elements - even the title sounds like it belongs on the Hallmark Channel - seem utterly reasonable. Stamp plays Arthur, a salty bloke who has little patience for anything except his wife and granddaughter. He assumes the worst from people, especially his son, James (Christopher Eccleston). Arthur appears to ask James for favors with the express purpose of lecturing the divorced dad over what the old spitfire will certainly deem mediocre results. Yet when it comes to his dying wife, Marion (Redgrave), Arthur is loving, if not overly demonstrative. They have a playful rapport that feels natural.The importance of the pair's chemistry can't be overstated. If Arthur was an angry, one-note Scrooge, it would be impossible to care about his fate. Even with the tiniest of gestures, Stamp never misses an opportunity to show that Arthur is capable of love, which makes him sympathetic even when he's at his worst (which is a lot).

That road is literal in the film's opening scene, in which 14-year-old Duncan (Liam James), on his way to a cramped, damp summer on the Massachusetts shore, is trapped in a car being driven by his mother's boyfriend, Trent (Steve Carell). While Duncan's mom, Pam (Toni Collette), naps, Trent is haranguing Duncan about his social skills, sharply asking the teenager how he would rate himself on a scale from 1 to 10, then volunteering that he'd give Duncan &quot;a 3.&quot; Trent is a nasty piece of work, judgmental and rigid, traits no less eloquently telegraphed for the fact that much of the sequence is filmed showing only his sharply accusing eyes in the rearview mirror. Once arrived at &quot;Riptide,&quot; Trent's cottage, the group is immediately set upon by Betty (Allison Janney), Trent's blowsy neighbor who's a compulsive hugger and prodigious tippler, and whose motto is: &quot;Accept it and move on.&quot; While Trent and Pam become absorbed in the beach town's social life, Duncan gets busy being rejected by Trent's daughter's clique, although Betty's daughter, Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb), shows some potential for self-awareness. Desperate for escape, Duncan bicycles away from the compound one day, finally finding himself - literally and figuratively - at the Water Wizz, a vintage water park overseen by a perennial teenager named Owen (Sam Rockwell).

A riotous display of serial explosions, helicopter crashes, car smash-ups, sniper attacks and at least one slap on the face of a winsome little girl, &quot;White House Down&quot; is the kind of celebration of rampant mayhem in which everyone seems to have a rocket launcher - or at least a live hand grenade - at the ready, just in case they need to dispatch a scrum of exceptionally vile and cruel villains. But &quot;White House Down&quot; also clearly wants to be a lighthearted comedy. At least that seems to be the aim in a film that, in the midst of sadistic violence, throws in jokes and bits of buddy humor as blithely as its protagonists toss those grenades. If cognitive dissonance ensues for an audience unsure whether to laugh or wince, that's nothing compared to the level of sheer volume - and preposterousness - the film inevitably reaches for with its we-can-top-that finale.

Anchored by a solid lead performance by Brad Pitt, who plays a happy Philadelphia househusband pulled back into his old profession of U.N. investigator when a zombie apocalypse threatens to destroy the world, &quot;World War Z&quot; may not break new ground in either of the genres it straddles. But it deserves a certain amount of credit for refusing to buy into the current cinematic arms race in Biggest, Loudest and Dumbest. The result is a movie that, while no classic, can be credited with giving the audience something a bit more substantive than the usual disposable summer fare.
