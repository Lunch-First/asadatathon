<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HIGH POINT, N.C. - The North Carolina-based home furnishings company that markets Paula Deen's furniture line is sticking with the embattled celebrity chef. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The High Point Enterprise reports that Universal Furniture International will continue to market the Paula Deen Home Collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deen has been under fire since the revelation earlier this year of a legal deposition in which Deen admitted under oath to having used the N-word. Many companies have dropped Deen since the deposition became public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Scheffer with Universal Furniture says he feels bad for Deen. He says the Deen he knows isn't the one who has been portrayed in the media recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scheffer wrote retailers saying his company accepts Deen's apologies for her previous comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">money for shooter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS, Ohio - An Ohio firearms group has raised more than $12,000 to buy guns or a security system for George Zimmerman, the former neighborhood watch volunteer who was recently acquitted of all charges in the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Hanson of the Buckeye Firearms Foundation says the group sent Zimmerman a check for $12,150.37 Tuesday. He says the fundraising effort was launched because the group believes Zimmerman's gun rights are being violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Department of Justice has taken all the evidence from the trial, including the gun that killed Martin, as part of a civil rights investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An attorney for Zimmerman has said his client is getting threats since the verdict earlier this month and has been carrying a weapon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ethanol at Tampa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA, Fla. - Firefighters in Florida are working with CSX Transportation officials to upright 10 toppled train cars that derailed at the Port of Tampa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CSX spokesman Gary Sease told the Tampa Bay Times about 4,500 gallons of ethanol spilled onto the ground when the 81-car train derailed early Thursday. No one was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sease says the ethanol was contained to the immediate area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials say the train was heading to the port from Chicago. The cause of the derailment was not immediately known. CSX officials are investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities restricted access to the port while Tampa Fire Rescue crews sprayed foam onto the spill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prison population</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">down for third year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - The government says the U.S. prison population dropped for the third straight year in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bureau of Justice Statistics says there were more than 1.5 million prison inmates last year. That's a drop of 1.7 percent from 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prison population hit a high of more than 1.6 million inmates in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the overall decline, the federal prison population actually rose by nearly 1,500 inmates last year. The state population dropped by nearly 30,000 inmates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California is responsible for most of the decrease in the number of state inmates. That's because of a 2011 law sending non-serious, non-violent or non-sex offenders to county jails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nine states saw their prison populations drop by more than 1,000 - California, Texas, North Carolina, Colorado, Arkansas, New York, Florida, Virginia and Maryland.</SPAN></P>
