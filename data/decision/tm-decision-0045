<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI BEACH &amp;#8212; The mother of slain Florida teenager Trayvon Martin joined a prominent African-American lawyers organization in vowing Monday to keep the pressure on legislators to repeal or overhaul &quot;stand your ground&quot; self-defense laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sybrina Fulton repeated her assertion that neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman &quot;got away with murder&quot; in the 2012 killing of her son largely because of Florida's self-defense law, which generally removed a person's duty to retreat if possible in the face of danger. It was the first of its kind in the nation when passed in 2005. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, about two dozen states have similar laws, but the focus of repeal efforts is squarely on Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have to change the law so that this doesn't happen to someone else's child,&quot; Fulton told reporters at the National Bar Association's annual meeting. &quot;My son wasn't doing anything wrong. He was simply walking home. He wasn't a suspect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, has rejected calls for a special legislative session on &quot;stand your ground&quot; from protesters who have been occupying part of the Capitol in Tallahassee since Zimmerman was acquitted earlier this month by a jury in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman claimed self-defense in shooting the 17-year-old Martin during a fight; Martin's supporters say Zimmerman profiled and followed him because Martin was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senate President Don Gaetz, also a Republican, said Monday he agrees with Scott that there is no need for a special session. G</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aetz said there is little agreement on whether change is needed to the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law and that voters have a chance in the 2014 elections to make their views known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If people want to change the policymakers, if they want to change the policies, that's why we have elections,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part of the message of Monday's event was just that: urging people to register to vote and contribute to sympathetic politicians if they want such laws repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organization's president, John Page, also said the legal system needs to do more to ensure that racially balanced juries are chosen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need to raise our voices together and say, &amp;#8216;Enough,'&quot; Page said. &quot;This should be the first state where &amp;#8216;stand your ground' falls. And it will fall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although he was not part of the event, the Rev. Jesse Jackson appeared as a spectator and later told reporters that the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law reminded him of past laws that prevented blacks from sitting at the front of buses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such an ordinance sparked the bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955 that was key to the civil rights movement &amp;#8212; which did not focus just on the bus drivers, but on ending the law itself, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because Zimmerman's trial was not focused on race, Jackson added, it &quot;did not have a foundation based on reality. We're not looking for a fight. We're looking for a solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Justice Department is investigating whether Zimmerman, who identifies as Hispanic, may have committed a hate crime in killing Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Legal experts say it would be a difficult charge to bring because no evidence has surfaced indicating Zimmerman singled out Martin because he was black or that he harbored racial bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Associated Press writer Gary Fineout in Tallahassee contributed to this story.</SPAN></P>
