<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lancaster branch of the NAACP on Monday evening urged members of the community to take action with their pens and write letters to local legislators as a step toward eliminating social injustices and evoking change. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 70 community members, including Lancaster Mayor Rick Gray and a panel of social justice leaders, religious leaders and attorneys, packed an all-purpose room at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Lancaster for a discussion about issues surrounding racial profiling, voter identification and stand-your-ground laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dwayne Jackson, central sectional director of the Pennsylvania NAACP branches, thanked the crowd: &quot;That lets me know there is hope,&quot; he said of those who attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-hour meeting was aimed at inspiring a community movement for change and largely dealt with topics surrounding the verdict in the Trayvon Martin case. George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of the teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our biggest thing as we have these meetings - (is) to find out what we can actually do,&quot; said Rita Smith-Wade-El, Millersville University professor and director of African-American studies. &quot;What can we do to make some changes in policy, in procedure, in laws?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick Miron, racial and gender equality advocate for Lancaster YWCA, said an important step forward is understanding differences in race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I think people need to start thinking about is not how we're different, but how we should come together,&quot; Miron said. &quot;We've been separated by our differences for hundreds of years. We've been divided and separated. That's playing out today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith-Wade-El said that, moving forward, Americans should base relationships with one another on those differences, not similarities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like celebrating difference because it means I don't have to be like you for you not to see an issue with me,&quot; Smith-Wade-El said. &quot;The strength of our country is its diversity, and if we begin to minimize diversity, we will weaken our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many community members shared personal experiences of racial profiling. Gray shared a conversation he once had with a judge regarding sentencing numbers of African Americans, Latinos and whites being within the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said, Judge, you're starting in the wrong place,&quot; Gray said. &quot;Start at the beginning. Who gets arrested for what? That's where you should start.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miron urged attendees to &quot;register to vote and call your representative,&quot; while community philanthropist Kimyatta Williams said change starts with love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we love and teach our children love, it's then that we become a unity,&quot; Williams said. &quot;Our children are our future. Start with loving them and investing in them, and then we have a chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other suggestions for change included more education about race and activities for children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Lancaster chapter, the NAACP will be holding town hall meetings nationwide to address &quot;the concerns of the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local chapter said it hopes for continued participation at future gatherings here and throughout the country and offered a statement of thanks after the meeting on its Facebook page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would like to thank our panelists, moderator and community members for supporting our town hall meeting. There were many ideas exchanged and together we can move forward as a united voice.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
