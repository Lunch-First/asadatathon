<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 29--YORK, Pa. -- Eric Kirkland approached a group of people sitting in a York park and knocked on an empty chair like it was a door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good afternoon, good afternoon,&quot; he said. &quot;How is everybody?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wanted their help with a project -- to preserve the stories of a generation of black families that moved to York decades ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been collecting a lot of pictures and stuff from back in the day,&quot; said the 60-year-old Kirkland. &quot;But we have so much history that we don't have recorded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorothy Sweeney, 79, told him her name. One of her children added that the maiden name was Hawkins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirkland was surprised to learn that Sweeney's mother was the late Rhoda Hawkins, a former</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Codorus Street resident and baker known for her pies and hot rolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She owned that store that was right here, the restaurant?&quot; Kirkland said. &quot;OK. I didn't know. See, I'm learning already.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where was your dad born at?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exchange took place Saturday at the second annual Codorus Street Reunion, an event that celebrated more than 90 years of black history in York and looked to the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirkland said black people, including his grandparents, who left the south and came to York were pioneers, looking for a better way of life for their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirkland said he previously worked as an information technology project manager for the state and is now semi-retired. He works</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">part-time as a youth counselor. He said he's hoping stories from the struggles of the people who moved to York will help the next generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the people gathered at Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park Saturday reflected on old times in the neighborhood and changes in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody was one big happy family,&quot; said Rosetta M. Hawkins, 67, who grew up on Codorus Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She thinks drugs and violence have made the city more dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she hasn't left. She lives several blocks away from where she grew up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's all I know,&quot; she said with a laugh. &quot;It's where I've lived all my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric's 64-year-old brother, Jeff, lives on the 400 block of West Market Street, an area known as Doctor's Row.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Kirkland said that was an area he wasn't allowed to go to when he was younger because of segregation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Kirkland said people often pay attention to racial issues after a tragedy or major incident, such as the fatal shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin last year and the recent acquittal of George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A week or two later, people are back into the doldrums,&quot; he said. &quot;They're back into the apathy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was disappointed with the number of eligible black voters who turned out to vote in the May primary. He called it a historic moment, where the city's first elected black female mayor was challenged by the first black female York City Council member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirkland said he thinks one way to make progress is to connect young black people with some of the people who grew up on Codorus Street decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are dying off. So we see an extra urgency ... to have our young people interact with some of our older people,&quot; he said. &quot;...They might absorb some of those values, and some of those traditions, some of the culture that we have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Kirkland asked Sweeney and two of her children questions about their family for more than five minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he told them he didn't want to tire them out. He said he'd follow up with them later, and he was thinking about doing video interviews with older people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because ... once that history's gone, man, you just can't get it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They chatted for a few minutes about World War I, speaking French and how people used to hunt groundhogs and other animals along a creek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Kirkland stood up, and started moving to the next family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Sweeney spoke up.&quot;My dad helped dig the foundation to build a church over there, too,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was referring to Emmanuel Church of God in Christ, which was originally built on Codorus Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Kirkland sat back down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Sweeney's children told him that she is an original member of the church, which is now on the 800 block of East Princess Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Kirkland started writing that down.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A souvenir booklet that was prepared for the second annual Codorus Street Reunion contains information for more than 70 Codorus Street addresses from 1919 through 1961.</SPAN></P>
