A Bethesda man was beaten and robbed early Saturday morning in Adams Morgan by three men who yelled, "This is for Trayvon Martin," before attacking him, police said. 
The incident is being investigated as a hate crime and robbery, according to D.C. police spokesman Araz Alali.
Three black men approached an adult white male from behind while he was walking in the 1700 block of Euclid Street NW at 1:26 a.m. Saturday, police said.
Two of the men threw the victim to the ground and kicked him, Alali said. The three perpetrators then took the victim's iPhone and wallet and fled.
The victim suffered minor injuries and declined medical attention, authorities said.
"There is no pattern in these types of crimes. These attacks are outrageous; we are doing everything in our power to see that they certainly don't occur. If they do occur, we are going to aggressively investigate them and bring people to justice," Alali said.
