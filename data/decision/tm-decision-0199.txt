Trayvon Martin's death was a terrible and avoidable tragedy that would not have happened if Zimmerman had the guts to simply say "excuse me, do you live hear?". 
Now, thousands of people are marching in the streets protesting the perceived injustice of the trial.
Meanwhile, 8-year-old Aylasha Carradine was shot dead when she answered the front door of her friend's house in Oakland.
Sadly, Aylasha's murder brings little concern, a few lines in the news and then on to something else.
Brushing these things aside is the worst form of racial prejudice. It's like saying "oh well, that's just the way they are".
There are solutions to what's happening in places like Oakland, but no amount of police effort can ever fix it. It's not that simple.
