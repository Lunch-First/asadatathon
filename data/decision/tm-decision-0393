<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Bill 131 proposes to help childhood sexual abuse victims advance monetary claims against third parties by extending the statute of limitations. Although well-intended, the proposed legislation is a terrible law that is blatantly prejudicial and discriminatory against private employers and nonprofit organizations such as the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts of America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SB 131 allows victims of childhood sexual abuse more time to sue for money and has nothing to do with holding a child abuse victimizer accountable for his criminal behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SB 131 would hold one third-party employer guilty and another employer not guilty for the same behavior, and that would grant redress to one victim but not another for the same criminal victimization. This would violate the principle of equal protection under the law because it would not apply to public schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unintended consequences of SB 131 being passed and signed into law could be catastrophic. As a retired peace officer who has been involved in Scouting for over 50 years of my life, I can attest that the most effective gang prevention program in the United States is the Boy Scouts of America. BSA is a private nonprofit that happens to emphasize each Scout's religious beliefs with reverence for God. This traditional part of American culture, which molds young boys into responsible and productive young men, would be at risk if Scouting was sued out of existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private employers such as the Catholic Church also would face dire financial straits if SB 131 passes. Private church property and Christian charitable services provided to the poor, homeless and marginalized by religious institutions would be jeopardized if Christian institutions could not continue to serve their flocks because they have been bankrupted by questionable lawsuits that occurred many years ago, with evidence being destroyed and witnesses having died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a veteran law enforcement practitioner, I am surprised that SB 131 does not allow the criminal or the actual abuser to be sued. And it does nothing to increase criminal penalties against child molesters and child rapists. The reason why statutes of limitations have been part of our criminal justice system in California is because it affords due process and a speedy trial for the accused being prosecuted for a crime. The preservation of evidence and the memories of witnesses that have been destroyed or forgotten in child abuse cases would be seriously compromised under civil proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As evidenced by the recent George Zimmerman trial, even a year after the tragic death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin occurred, many witnesses could not precisely remember things they observed or heard in 2012. Under civil proceedings in California, the standard of evidentiary proof is significantly lowered by using a preponderance of evidence standard, or &quot;more likely than not,&quot; as opposed to &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; in a criminal trial. A church pastor or Girl Scout leader who is being accused of child sex abuse that occurred over 50 years ago could be dead and not able to testify on his/her own behalf. Such was the case with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SB 131 would restart a process in California whereby tort attorneys would have a heyday filing frivolous lawsuits seeking large monetary damages with only cursory evidence against traditional insitutions like the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts of America. Seems to me like greed, not justice and peace.</SPAN></P>
