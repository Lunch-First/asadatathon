THE neighbourhood watch volunteer who has been in hiding since his acquittal for shooting dead an unarmed black teenager helped to rescue a family from a car crash, police disclosed yesterday. 
 George Zimmerman's whereabouts have remained secret after the verdict provoked nationwide protests, a debate about race and guns and intervention by President Barack Obama.
 But the report from the local sheriff's office indicates that he has not left his central Florida home town of Sanford where he killed 17-year-old TrayvonMartin after a confrontation in his gated community in February last year.
 Mr Zimmerman, 29, was one of two men who went to the rescue of two parents and their two children after their sport utility vehicle overturned at a highway junction in Sanford last Wednesday. He helped the family out of the crashed car and waited for the police to arrive.
 "Zimmerman was not a witness to the crash and left after making contact with the deputy," said Heather Smith, the police spokesman. "There were no report of injuries to the vehicle occupants."
 The sheriff's department has not released any details about the family, or the other man with Mr Zimmerman.
 There had been speculation that he would leave the area to start a new life after a jury accepted his lawyer's argument that he had shot Trayvon in self-defence because he feared for his life.
In a separate development, Sanford police said they had handed evidence from their investigation to the FBI as the Department of Justice investigates whether to press federal hate crime charges against Mr Zimmerman.
