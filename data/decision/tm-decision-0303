<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Barack Obama said Trayvon Martin could have been him 35 years ago.  &quot;The death of Trayvon Martin was a tragedy. Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America.&quot;  I think it was a tragedy for America. But not in the way our president does. I view it as a tragedy that all of America had to endure a trial that had nothing to do with the entire country, let alone the entire world. This was a case that should have stayed in Florida.  Regarding African Americans that have witnessed women on elevators clutch their purses tighter, etc. I have seen many Caucasians that would elicit the same reaction. What a racist comment, by the president of the United States no less. There is too much rhetoric and vitriol that is leading us toward the Divided States of America. There were 61 murders in Chicago during the Zimmerman trial. Where is the outrage? No, we need to focus our attention on one shooting of an African American, by a non African American ? by a United States of American. Let's move on with no further discussion regarding this tragedy. Yes, it is a tragedy when anyone loses their life.  Let's find a way to be more united. Israel Grossman Taylorsville  </SPAN></P>
