<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How many baseballs are used in a major league game and what is done with the used balls?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--- Terry Campbell, Big Canoe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: About 120 balls are used during MLB games, but that figure varies depending on weather conditions, the length of the game and the number of balls hit or tossed out of play, among other variables. There were about 15-18 dozen (180-216 balls) used during a 15-inning game between the Minnesota Twins and Milwaukee Brewers last year, according to a Fox Sports North article. In 2005, it was estimated that more than 900,000 balls were used during an average MLB season, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Balls that don't have much wear are sometimes used for pregame batting and infield practice. They also can be used in indoor batting cages or sent to minor league teams. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Why was Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla., and not in Miami Gardens in the middle of the school year? Sanford is approximately 250 miles from Miami Gardens. How did he plan to get back to school on Monday, Feb. 27?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--- Trish Ranck, Atlanta</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Martin, who was a junior at Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School in Miami, was serving a 10-day suspension from school when he was shot on Sunday, Feb. 26, 2012. He had been caught with an &quot;empty plastic bag with traces of marijuana in it,&quot; according to a police report obtained by the Miami Herald. Martin was visiting with his father at his father's girlfriend's condominium in Sanford. It was Martin's third suspension, the paper reported. The others were for defacing school lockers with graffiti and for tardiness and truancy.</SPAN></P>
