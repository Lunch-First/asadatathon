Singer and entertainer Harry Belafonte has called on Florida governor Rick Scott to listen to protesters who are asking for a special legislative session to examine the state's self-defence laws after the acquittal of George Zimmerman.
Zimmerman was cleared after shooting dead unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in February 2012. Protesters angry with the verdict have spent nearly two weeks at the Capitol building. Belafonte said Scott still has a chance to act before the protests intensify.
