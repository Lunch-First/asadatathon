<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am appalled by Rob Rogers' cartoons and the whole Trayvon Martin debacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First off is Rob Rogers' July 19 cartoon depicting an African-American boy being told by his mother not to wear a hoodie, not to walk through a nice neighborhood, etc., while the Caucasian boy is told not to forget to floss. Seriously, Mr. Rogers, could you be any more biased? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am aware of an incident in which a young white man who was minding his own business Downtown was waiting on his ride when three black men beat the daylights out of him and robbed him. Oh, that's right, that was not reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media, President Barack Obama and the Jessie Jackson types need to take a step back and stop aspiring to infuse race into everything. If you paid attention to the trial and the laws of the state of Florida, you would know that the jury called the verdict correctly. That's not to say it's not a shame that a young man lost his life; however, there is no benefit to thugs protesting in many states adopting this as an excuse to brutalize innocent human beings and destroy private property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It makes better sense to use your energy to change the laws in Florida. How refreshing it would be to see Mr. Jackson and Mr. Obama implementing a plan to restrain the black-on-black violence especially in Mr. Obama's home state of Illinois instead of injecting himself and his Hollywood cronies into a situation that is truly despairing for political gain and keeping the fires of bigotry burning.</SPAN></P>
