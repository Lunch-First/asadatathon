The George Zimmerman verdict is an American tragedy for families and in particular African-American families.
When my son was 16 years old he had just left Annapolis High School and he went to the old credit union located next to the school. He wanted to go to the ATM in the lobby, but the door was locked. It was around 1 p.m. He left and caught the city bus. 
Halfway down Riva Road the bus was pulled over by the police. He was removed from the bus in front of everyone and was spread eagle and frisked on Riva Road. They opened his wallet and found $10. He was asked by the police officer where did you get the $10. Forever humiliated, he was told by the police that someone reported seeing him come out of a locked building. I am 100 percent sure that he was profiled because of his race and this would not have happened to a white male.
These incidents are repeated over and over with blacks. There is a residue of institutional racism that many has turn a blind eye or maybe people just aren't aware of the problems. A young unarmed 17-year-old child is killed and the justice system says it was self defense and no time is served. But, we have young African-American males serving long sentences for minor offenses.
There are many people of all races who are working toward equality and trying to make this country a better nation. We need open discussions about race in America and not to place blame on any particular person or race. And most of all we need to pray for a nation that is seeking justice and liberty for all.
