<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As most of your readers hopefully know by now, the Zimmerman case had nothing at all to do with the stand-your-ground law. As Humboldt County District Attorney Paul Gallegos points out, all &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; does is eliminate the &quot;duty to retreat&quot; when faced with lethal force. (&quot;Gallegos weighs in on stand-your-ground laws,&quot; Times-Standard, July 21, Page A1) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The citizens in over 30 states have decided that if faced with deadly force yourself, you should be able to respond with deadly force of your own, without the burden of trying to seek escape, which may get you killed, and without the threat of prosecutors taking away your liberty for not using an escape route you simply may not have seen, or deemed unsafe to take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What stand-your-ground laws do not do is allow you to use deadly force in any situation where you are not in fear of great bodily injury or death. That does not change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that is why it is a ridiculous question to ask, as our president did, whether Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have &quot;stood his ground&quot; and shot Mr. Zimmerman that night if Trayvon had been armed. No, Mr. President, he could not. You cannot claim you are in imminent fear of great bodily injury or death simply because someone may have been following you in a place they had every right to be.</SPAN></P>
