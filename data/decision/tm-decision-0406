<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Issue: Rev. Al Sharpton's role in a range of racial issues, including the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hats off to Jonah Goldberg for stating the truth about Rev. Al Sharpton, something most of the media and politicians are afraid to do (&quot;The Rev's Racket,&quot; PostOpinion, July 20).   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sharpton has never been anything more than a race-baiting, trouble-making, tax-evading shakedown artist and a buffoon. Sharpton has made a lucrative business of inflaming racial tensions and capitalizing on tragedies to support his extravagant lifestyle.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If he were held accountable for his actions, he would cry racism, which politicians are afraid of.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The only question that he should be asked by the media is: &quot;How's Tawana Brawley?&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How does Sharpton continue to get away with it? Between Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, there will never be racial accord in this country. They put organized crime to shame, and no one will take them on. Frank Giffone </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Manhattan </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thanks to Goldberg for reminding us of Sharpton's shamelessness.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Goldberg recounts the horrific Brawley hoax, in which he fanned the flames of racism in a situation built entirely on lies. The Crown Heights riots of 1991 were also nurtured and encouraged by Sharpton.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The anti-Semitic hatred that he generated after Gavin Cato's accidental death helped lead to the murder of Yankel Rosenbaum.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rather than being castigated and perhaps imprisoned for his racist rants and incitements, Sharpton is now the host of an MSNBC show and enjoys his &quot;partnership&quot; with Eric Holder.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shame on a society that celebrates such a depraved character.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sharpton's leadership in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin demonstrations is to be expected. He is enabled by a society that has lost its values.  </SPAN></P>
