<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I'd like to know how the judge in Mason County is going to sleep having ruled that the principal in Mason County did not abuse the disabled child who he rolled down the bus aisle and down the steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-To the reader who thinks that President Obama is making our country economically sound, you're either blind, crazy or you're a moron. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I get the Sunday paper every week and you have not put in there the interest rate and the metal prices. I'd like to see that put back in the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-After watching the world news tonight and Obama's rating, I finally figured out why Obama spends so much time globetrotting and is now in Illinois. It's because he is not welcome in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-As a young fellow, I made up my mind I did not want to be a breeder. Too many West Virginians are breeders, not fathers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I saw the state Capitol dome behind the weatherman on the news the other night. Since the fireworks, the dome is dull and not shiny like it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-In the eight years of his presidency, George W. Bush was on vacation 1,020 days, 32 percent of his time or almost three years out of eight. As of January 2013, President Obama had been on vacation a total of 83 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Quit repeating hearsay comments and research the Zimmerman case. Research crime statistics for Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman had every reason to be suspicious when noticing a stranger in the neighborhood. It wasn't profiling. He was a concerned homeowner. That is not a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-This is directed toward the far-right religious zealots: Is a vasectomy and a tubal ligation the same as an abortion?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-So sad but true. Many American citizens cannot even define the word &quot;sin.&quot; They have not a clue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Employees at the DuPont Belle plant have been calling the Readers' Voice about the problems at the DuPont plant. You refuse to write them and now you see what the outcome is. The place is falling apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I see in the paper where CAMC is going to purchase a new helicopter, but I do not know why they can't fix that swamp and mosquito haven across from General?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The left-wing press and civil rights crowd want to crucify Zimmerman. Would they be just as eager to crucify someone who looks like Obama? Who are the real &quot;racists,&quot; Gazette?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The richest 300 people on Earth have more money than the poorest 3 billion. A worldwide revolution is coming. We just do not know when.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Perhaps if we heard less from the old people and more from young journalists the former state newspaper wouldn`t be as dull as dishwater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The Weather Channel is reporting that ocean waters are too cool to produce tropical storms and hurricanes. Now isn't this interesting. This won't be mentioned by media with an agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Wonder why we always have the money to bail out the greedy bankers and Wall Street thieves, but no money to save an American city. The Republicans think that is the way it should be, mainly because most of them are in bed with the thieves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Zimmerman is half Hispanic and half white. Obama is half white and half black. If someone like Obama had killed Trayvon Martin would there have been such an uproar and media circus with political grandstanding? Of course not.</SPAN></P>
