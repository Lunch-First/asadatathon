Jamie Foxx is upset George Zimmerman was acquitted of murder charges after he gunned down teenager TrayvonMartin.
Zimmerman, 29, shot and killed an unarmed 17-year-old, TrayvonMartin, in Sanford, Florida on February 26, 2012.  
The case has garnered controversy worldwide as George, a Hispanic American, was accused by protestors of racially profiling Trayvon, who is black.
The prosecution tried the case as criminal profiling.
Jamie, who portrayed the titular character, a former slave, in Quentin Tarantino's historic spaghetti western Django Unchained, is upset by the decision.
He is a father himself and the star empathises with the deep pain that comes with the loss of a child.
"First of all, I was disappointed like everyone else," he told Extra at Comic-Con in San Diego. "I was crushed because I have a personal relationship with his mom and his father."
Thousands of people across America have protested against the court's decision to release Zimmerman after his acquittal was announced July 13.
Jamie is in awe over how race relations are still even part of the conversation.
"[Trayvon's mom, Sybrina Fulton] never made it about race," he explained. "She only said, 'My 17-year-old kid could be your 17-year-old kid.' Something the world could embrace."
Jamie believes people should remain "intelligent" and "peaceful" about how they express their frustration over the situation, as he does not support race riots.
Beyonc and Jay-Z joined Trayvon's mother and the Reverend Al Sharpton at a protest in New York City on Saturday.
During the event Ms. Fulton made it clear she won't stop seeking justice for Trayvon.
"I promise you I'm going to work for your children as well," she told the crowd. "Today it was my son. Tomorrow it might be yours."
