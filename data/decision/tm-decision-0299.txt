RIGHT-WING rocker Ted Nugent is ranting yet again about TrayvonMartin, this time suggesting African-Americans should be profiled in the same way a community watches after a dog with a history of biting children. 
"I think when you use the word 'profile,' if a Dalmatian has been biting the children in the neighborhood, I think we're going to look for a black and white dog," the controversial singer said on Nick Cannon's podcast Tuesday.
Racial profiling was at the heart of the question of why George Zimmerman followed TrayvonMartin on the night of their fateful encounter.
Following Zimmerman's acquittal July 13, Nugent penned a ferocious op-ed for a far-right website.
