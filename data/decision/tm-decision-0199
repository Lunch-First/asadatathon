<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin's death was a terrible and avoidable tragedy that would not have happened if Zimmerman had the guts to simply say &quot;excuse me, do you live hear?&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, thousands of people are marching in the streets protesting the perceived injustice of the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, 8-year-old Aylasha Carradine was shot dead when she answered the front door of her friend's house in Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, Aylasha's murder brings little concern, a few lines in the news and then on to something else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brushing these things aside is the worst form of racial prejudice. It's like saying &quot;oh well, that's just the way they are&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are solutions to what's happening in places like Oakland, but no amount of police effort can ever fix it. It's not that simple.</SPAN></P>
