<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of George Zimmerman's acquittal in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, I ask: What now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was shocked when my friend called and asked if I had heard the verdict announced. I said, &quot;No.&quot; She said sadly, &quot;George Zimmerman was found not guilty.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hurriedly told her to let me go to tune in to the news on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once I heard the news and analyses of the verdict, I began to reflect back to the times I had served on juries and wanted to vote based on my emotions rather than the evidence and laws presented in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since there weren't any witnesses to the fight, and Zimmerman wasn't compelled to testify, this may have cast doubt in the minds of the jurors. As I see it, Zimmerman was the judge, jury and executioner in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Trayvon's appearance, Zimmerman had determined that he was one of the &quot;(expletives)&quot; who always get away, as he related to the dispatcher, and he was going to make sure this one wouldn't get away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One may ask why Zimmerman felt that way. What was going through his mind? Or had he had negative experiences with other &quot;(expletives)?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What now, after the marches and protests have faded away? What are going to do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, blacks kill each other at an alarming rate - in fact, in the past 20 years, 47 percent of all murders in our country have been committed by blacks, who only make up 13 percent of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This isn't a just black problem. It is an American problem, too. What are we going to do to alleviate this problems and others?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to do something about gun control?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to mobilize to change the Stand Your Ground Law in Florida and any other state?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to improve the conditions of our underserved and isolated segments of our population?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to work to see that all citizens are treated equally in our legal system?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to continue to move away from troubled cities and create own little kingdoms?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to stop criticizing those who try to work or associate with other races?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to learn to respect people regardless of race or status in life?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to plan to improve our political divisions, both local and national?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to continue to assume that all persons of a race are lawless, just because a few are?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to continue to profile shoppers because of their race?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to continue to assume that some people are incompetent because of their race?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to promote and work to improve income and opportunity inequalities?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to encourage people of good character and integrity to become our political leaders?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we don't work to solve some of our interracial and intraracial problems, we are going to leave our country in bad shape for future generations.</SPAN></P>
