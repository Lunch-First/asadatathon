<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and George Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin-George Zimmerman case, the mainstream media has to take some of the blame for using the race card to the fullest extent. Zimmerman was not a racist - he dated a black girl, mentored young black males in need and took on the police over the treatment of a homeless black man. He never used racist slurs and saw crime in terms of right and wrong. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about the same time as the Martin shooting, elsewhere in the State of Florida there was a 16-year-old black youth sentenced to life in prison for shooting to death two white people just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Just weeks after the Martin shooting, in Phoenix, Ariz., a similar shooting took place at a restaurant involving a black motorist shooting and killing an unarmed &quot;white Hispanic&quot; male in a confrontation. The black motorist used Arizona's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law and to date has not been charged. I do not recall any protests or media frenzy condemning the black motorist for shooting an unarmed man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws in some states were brought in because of the increase in violent crime. It is mostly blacks, women and vulnerable people who benefit the most from these laws. As for being racist, it is mostly blacks who are the victims of violent crime, committed by other blacks in many high-crime areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political correctness denies the truth or root causes in many cases. In turn, most media outlets are afraid to admit or apologize for it. The same media that question or criticize the Second Amendment will do anything to defend the First Amendment, even if a network like NBC doctored the 911 call by Zimmerman, who is now suing the network. Let's hope he wins.</SPAN></P>
