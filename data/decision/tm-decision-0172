Attorney Diamond was recently a featured guest speaker on several radio shows and on a major Television station to discuss the high profile Zimmerman murder trial involving the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Sanford, Florida.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin took place on the eve of February 26, 2012 in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, where Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was staying temporarily. George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old mixed race Hispanic was the neighborhood watch coordinator for the gated community where the fatal shooting took place. After Zimmerman placed a call to police, law enforcement arrived within two minutes of the fatal shooting that took place during the scuffle. <BR>Zimmerman was taken into custody, treated for his head wounds and subsequently questioned for five hours. The police chief released Zimmerman for lack of evidence and lack of legal grounds to make an arrest and said that Zimmerman has the right to defend himself and use lethal force. However, six weeks after the shooting, Zimmerman was facing murder charges and was appointed a special prosecutor by Governor Rick Scott. The high profile and highly controversial murder trial began on June 10, 2013 in Sanford, Florida and Zimmerman was acquitted on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges by a jury on July 13, 2013. <BR>Throughout the case, attorney David Diamond was called upon as legal expert to discuss the Zimmerman case and featured on several radio shows and on Television. Los Angeles criminal defense attorney David Diamond was a guest speaker where he discussed the Zimmerman case on the Financial Survivor Network, the Amy Beth Arkawy Show, the Think Tank (AM 870/FM 105.3), Newstalk AM 1470 in Tampa Bay, and America's Radio News.
