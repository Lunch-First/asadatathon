<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAIRO - In dark sunglasses and a uniform studded with medals, Egypt's top general is everywhere, looking down from posters and banners proclaiming him &quot;lion of the nation.&quot; Adoring songs vow &quot;We are behind you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barely a month after he removed the elected president, Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi is riding a wave of adulation, drawing comparisons between him and modern Egypt's first charismatic strongman, former President Gamal Abdel-Nasser. State media and pro-military TV channels and newspapers have done everything they can to fuel the fervor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I worry about el-Sissi and the possible arrogance of the victor. And I fear him if he decides that the army is stronger than any future president that he will control like a puppet,&quot; wrote Mohammed Fathy, a columnist in the newspaper Al-Watan. &quot;The admiration for him has gone beyond normal levels and is now more like deifying him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hype has swelled to the point that some are convinced el-Sissi will take off his uniform and run for president in elections due to take place early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panel backs lung cancer screening for certain heavy smokers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time, government advisers are recommending screening for lung cancer, saying certain current and former heavy smokers should get annual scans to cut their chances of dying of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it becomes final as expected, the advice by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force would clear the way for insurers to cover CT scans, a type of X-ray, for those at greatest risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would be people ages 55 through 79 who smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 30 years or the equivalent, such as two packs a day for 15 years. Whether screening would help younger or lighter smokers isn't known, so scans are not advised for them. They also aren't for people who quit at least 15 years ago, or people too sick or frail to undergo cancer treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The evidence shows we can prevent a substantial number of lung cancer deaths by screening&quot; - about 20,000 of the 160,000 that occur each year in the United States, said Dr. Michael LeFevre, a task force leader and family physician at the University of Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wave of car bombings in Iraq kills at least 58</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD - More than a dozen explosions, mainly from car bombs, ripped through marketplaces, parking lots, a cafe and rush-hour crowds in Iraq on Monday, killing at least 58 people and pushing the country's death toll for the month of July toward the 700 mark, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bombings - 18 in all - are part of a wave of bloodshed that has swept across the country since April, killing more than 3,000 people and worsening the already strained ties between Iraq's Sunni minority and the Shiite-led government. The scale and pace of the violence, unseen since the darkest days of the country's insurgency, have fanned fears of a return to the widespread sectarian bloodletting that pushed Iraq to the brink of civil war after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With two days left in July, the month's death toll now stands at 680, according to an Associated Press count. Most of those have come during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of dawn-to-dusk fasting that began July 10, making it Iraq's bloodiest since 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marint's mother: Repeal stand-ground law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - The mother of slain Florida teenager Trayvon Martin joined a prominent African-American lawyers organization in vowing Monday to keep the pressure on legislators to repeal or overhaul &quot;stand your ground&quot; self-defense laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sybrina Fulton repeated her assertion that neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman &quot;got away with murder&quot; in the 2012 killing of her son largely because of Florida's self-defense law, which generally removed a person's duty to retreat if possible in the face of danger. It was the first of its kind in the nation when passed in 2005. Now, about two dozen states have similar laws, but the focus of repeal efforts is squarely on Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to change the law so that this doesn't happen to someone else's child,&quot; Fulton told reporters at the National Bar Association's annual meeting. &quot;My son wasn't doing anything wrong. He was simply walking home. He wasn't a suspect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
