I usually read the E-R every morning and find a lot of articles very good and it gives the readers a large spectrum of information. So I read the E-R's letters to the editor. Having said that, I am writing this letter to let everyone know that your president, uh, made a boo-boo (really) on TV when he went into the press room to give his "racist" opinion of what happened at the very televised trial of George Zimmerman and the state of Florida. 
What the president said on television a few days ago, approximately July 19, about him as he relates to Trayvon Martin as both are black men. He has a habit of making most of his speeches all about him and he did not fail us by doing so in that speech. I will try to quote him as he said, "Trayvon Martin could have been me   35 years ago." Well, if that were the case, Trayvon would have lived in Hawaii, loved by his grandparents (white) and given the best education in a private school, and all they could do to provide for their grandson. However, I think what he meant to say (I hope) was: "I could have been Trayvon   35 years ago."
He surely did not want to be someone else, me thinks.
That darn teleprompter should have been there   with the correct information that he "probably" was trying to portray.
