  George Zimmerman, under wraps since beating murder and manslaughter charges, emerged from hiding to help passengers trapped in an overturned SUV, Florida officials said yesterday.  
  The former suspect, who gained infamy by killing unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, stopped Wednesday when he saw an overturned vehicle, Seminole County sheriff's spokeswoman Heather Smith said. 
  The crash happened at 5:45 p.m. Wednesday at Interstate 4 and Route 417, less than a mile from where Zimmerman killed Martin. 
  Zimmerman helped two parents and two children out of their blue Ford Explorer, where they were momentarily trapped, authorities said. 
  When deputies arrived, "two men - one of whom was George Zimmerman - had already helped assist the family by getting them out of the overturned vehicle," Smith said. 
  The four family members were not injured. 
  Zimmerman hasn't been seen in public since jurors declared him not guilty July 13, sparking protests across the country. 
   Neighborhood-watch volunteer Zimmerman mistook Martin for a burglar on Feb. 26, 2012. The two got into a confrontation that ended with Zimmerman shooting Martin. 
  Jurors agreed with defense claims that Zimmerman feared for his life and was justified to use deadly force against Martin.
