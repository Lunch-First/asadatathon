<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Opinion, July 25)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I fail to correlate the writer's piece with the Trayvon Martin story. So the writer had an intruder in his house. Even if he was a proud legal Canadian gun owner, his guns would have be locked away, and separated by ammunition in another box, guaranteeing safety to the intruder. Even if the intruder had decided to rob, injure, or do whatever he felt like, the Young Offenders Act would protect the accused, and forgive him at the age of 18. Besides being lucky, I would consider the writer more of a sitting duck rather than a proud Canadian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I, too, am a proud Canadian. With a wife from Chicago, I can tell you our race issues don't run as deep as our neighbours to the south, and the standard of living is somewhat better. But holding up a system that gives the wolves in society more benefit than the lambs is just naive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer's attempts to bring the two issues together tugs at the heart strings, but fails to come to a logical conclusion.</SPAN></P>
