<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I usually read the E-R every morning and find a lot of articles very good and it gives the readers a large spectrum of information. So I read the E-R's letters to the editor. Having said that, I am writing this letter to let everyone know that your president, uh, made a boo-boo (really) on TV when he went into the press room to give his &quot;racist&quot; opinion of what happened at the very televised trial of George Zimmerman and the state of Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the president said on television a few days ago, approximately July 19, about him as he relates to Trayvon Martin as both are black men. He has a habit of making most of his speeches all about him and he did not fail us by doing so in that speech. I will try to quote him as he said, &quot;Trayvon Martin could have been me   35 years ago.&quot; Well, if that were the case, Trayvon would have lived in Hawaii, loved by his grandparents (white) and given the best education in a private school, and all they could do to provide for their grandson. However, I think what he meant to say (I hope) was: &quot;I could have been Trayvon   35 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He surely did not want to be someone else, me thinks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That darn teleprompter should have been there   with the correct information that he &quot;probably&quot; was trying to portray.</SPAN></P>
