<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Division: A not-so-funny thing happened on the way to post-racial America. Under our first black president and &quot;Great Uniter,&quot; polling shows a serious worsening of race relations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember Los Angeles-based street artist Shepard Fairey's famous red, beige and blue Obama &quot;Hope&quot; poster for the 2008 campaign? In the heady days of early 2009, the New Yorker magazine's art critic declared that Fairey had &quot;created the most efficacious American political illustration since &quot;Uncle Sam Wants You.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The week before that grandiose pronouncement, the then-new attorney general of the U.S., Eric Holder, made his own grandiose remark: &quot;Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot, in things racial we have always been, and we, I believe, continue to be, in too many ways a nation of cowards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder vowed back then that his Justice Department &quot;must and will leave the nation to the &quot;new birth of freedom' &quot; promised by Abe Lincoln. But what has happened in the 4-1/2 years of Obama and Holder since then? Race relations have gone into a free fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, the share of Americans who consider race relations &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;fairly good&quot; has plummeted from above 70% between 2009 and 2011 to only 52% today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps most amazing is the poll's finding that just 38% of blacks in the U.S. -- in spite of America's first black president being re-elected less than a year ago -- hold a positive view of the current state of race relations. At the outset of Obama's presidency, by comparison, no doubt with Fairey's iconic, feel-good image in mind, nearly 80% of whites and some 63% of blacks had a favorable viewpoint on ties between the races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are the ingredients for racial combustion swirling dangerously together this midsummer? With the public still digesting George Zimmerman's exoneration on all charges in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a racially charged new offering from leading Hollywood lefty Harvey Weinstein is hitting movie houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; with Oscar written all over it, plays fast and loose with the facts of the shooting of unarmed black 22-year-old Oscar Grant by a white policeman in Oakland on New Year's Day 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every chance Barack Obama and Eric Holder get, they seem to pick at the nation's healing racial wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking sides against a jury's decision, the Great Uniter declared that &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me 35 years ago,&quot; and later called for a national &quot;conversation&quot; on race -- code for &quot;endless lectures&quot; by the left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder, meanwhile, this week defied a recent Supreme Court ruling by launching an attack on heavily Republican Texas' voter-ID laws. Yet the undeniable Black Panther voter intimidation in Philadelphia gets shrugged off by his Department of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also, of course, the tragic irony of black unemployment of close to 14% under the first black president,over six points above the general jobless rate of 7.6%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The colors on that Obama poster have faded, sadly, with nonwhites the biggest victims of this divisive president's extreme policies.</SPAN></P>
