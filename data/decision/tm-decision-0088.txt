RIVIERA BEACH -- As Tracy Martin walked across the pulpit at Hilltop Missionary Baptist Church Sunday night, a group of boys, about half his son Trayvon's age, gathered near a second-floor balcony, elbowing past each other so they could see him.
The preachers who came before Martin said he and Trayvon's mother, Sybrina Fulton, had become "parents to teenagers across America" in the year since George Zimmerman killed 17-year-old TrayvonMartin in Sanford. But Tracy Martin said that outside the presence of the cameras, when he is alone at night, he is simply a man who falls on his knees and prays about the loss of his son and the recent acquittal of the man who he believes murdered him. 
"One of the greatest gifts God can give a man is a son," Martin said. "I lost my son, but I'm here to make sure that you don't lose yours."
That statement brought cheers from the crowd of hundreds who gathered to hear Martin at a rally and fundraiser for the TrayvonMartin Foundation.
Riviera Beach Mayor Thomas Masters and several other local politicians and clergymen urged the crowd to channel their outrage over Zimmerman's acquittal into civic activism.
"What will make hell mad and Tallahassee nervous is when we develop strategy to go with our anger," Bishop Harold Calvin Ray said. Martin sat stoically as the speakers before him criticized prosecutors in his son's murder case and called for a repeal or amendment to Florida's "stand your ground" law. But he cheered along with the crowd as Ray said Zimmerman had no right to disobey a dispatcher's order and homeowner association rules before he took out a gun and shot Martin at the end of a brief struggle. Martin also stood and clapped as three teens about his son's age performed a dance to the Gospel song "Encourage Yourself."
The leaders of the rally asked the crowd to sign several petitions Sunday night -- including one calling for the federal government to pursue civil rights violations charges against Zimmerman. Masters called two 17-year-old boys to read the petition as a symbol of TrayvonMartin's age when he died.
Martin referenced that in his short speech.
"Trayvon was not just my son, he was your son, too," he said.
