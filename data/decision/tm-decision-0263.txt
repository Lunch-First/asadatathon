Rob Rogers' cartoon on July 19 was absolutely absurd. Nothing like profiling through a cartoon in a city paper. Does he think this applies to all black and white males? 
I think everyone needs to move on, and let Trayvon Martin's family start to heal. People are nonstop talking about due process. The fact is George Zimmerman was tried and found not guilty. Just because you don't like the outcome doesn't mean due process wasn't served and met.
Maybe Mr. Rogers could do a cartoon showing Marley Lion, an unarmed white male being shot by a black man, Oh, wait, that's right -- his story didn't make national news. Maybe the white news reporter was busy flossing his teeth!
