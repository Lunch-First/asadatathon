While growing up in the 1960s, I witnessed senseless discrimination against people because of their skin color, including neighbors who refused to help a black delivery driver who had slid off an icy road. In "To Kill a Mockingbird," we admire Atticus Finch as he defends Tom, who is falsely accused of raping a white woman.  
Finch seeks justice while battling a prejudiced system. I am reminded of Martin Luther King's quote: "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character." The Declaration of Independence states the same principle: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights ..." The same awful prejudice is seen in the rush to find George Zimmerman guilty because he killed an unarmed black teenager. The news media tried and convicted him before any evidence was presented - falsely using pictures of Trayvon Martin as a child. Much of the black leadership and our president are creating mob action to lynch a man who, based on evidence, was shown probably to not be guilty of murder. Injustice based on skin color is ugly and evil. Today's torching of Zimmerman is as dangerous as that seen in "To Kill a Mockingbird." Stupidity results when people think with their skin instead of their brains. Letters to the editor are encouraged.
