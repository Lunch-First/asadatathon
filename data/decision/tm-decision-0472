<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is no surprise that a majority of North Carolinians are now opposed to fracking. The law designed to fast-track the controversial process is titled the Domestic Energy Jobs Bill but increasingly the surplus of natural gas created by the &quot;energy boom&quot; is being shipped overseas to the highest bidder. As for the jobs, according to a report by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, there are considerably fewer than was earlier predicted </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this isn't enough to have citizens asking, &quot;What's in it for us,&quot; there is the way in which supporters of fracking have sponsored a series of bills designed to suppress debate, public input and transparency, most recently legislation that prohibits regulation requiring disclosure of chemicals used in fracking fluid. North Carolinians have made clear in polls that they want full disclosure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever those chemicals are, there's plenty of them - hundreds of thousands of pounds per well. In states where there is disclosure it has been shown that the additives include such dangerous substances as diesel and benzene. The vast amounts of waste water created contain radioactive elements like radium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is fashionable in some quarters to loftily dismiss concerns about groundwater contamination. But one doesn't have to be a NIMBY, alarmist or Luddite to object to drinking, bathing in, cooking with or irrigating with water containing toxins and carcinogens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fulfilling expectations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding Doug Clark's News &amp; Record (Greensboro ) article in The Herald-Sun's Sunday edition: Mr. Clark considered The New York Times article, &quot;The decline of North Carolina&quot; which was reprinted as an editorial column in The Herald-Sun without comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Clarks' conclusion, &quot;So far, he's (Gov. Pat McCrory) disappointing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. In fact, Gov. McCrory is not only not disappointing, he is fulfilling my every expectation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continued redistricting and voter apathy will support the governor and possibly will reelect him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We live in a &quot;stand your ground&quot; state. Did you know that? Not just a &quot;right to life&quot; state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So fetuses are safe but your neighbor bears watching. Don't threaten him in any way because he can shoot you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's develop solutions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the filing period has ended, I want to thank all of the candidates who have entered Durham's 2013 municipal campaign. I also want to thank the staff at the Board of Elections for assisting the candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I look forward to a spirited discussion of vital city issues during the forums, debates and interviews that will occur during the next several months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I especially invite the citizens to join us in a set of criticalconversations surrounding the senseless homicides that are taking away precious human potential from our city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's use this campaign season to develop solutions that will enhance Durham's long-term future.</SPAN></P>
