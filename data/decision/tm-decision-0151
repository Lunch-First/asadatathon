<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Bethesda man was beaten and robbed early Saturday morning in Adams Morgan by three men who yelled, &quot;This is for Trayvon Martin,&quot; before attacking him, police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident is being investigated as a hate crime and robbery, according to D.C. police spokesman Araz Alali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three black men approached an adult white male from behind while he was walking in the 1700 block of Euclid Street NW at 1:26 a.m. Saturday, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the men threw the victim to the ground and kicked him, Alali said. The three perpetrators then took the victim's iPhone and wallet and fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim suffered minor injuries and declined medical attention, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no pattern in these types of crimes. These attacks are outrageous; we are doing everything in our power to see that they certainly don't occur. If they do occur, we are going to aggressively investigate them and bring people to justice,&quot; Alali said.</SPAN></P>
