<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was described as a beautiful boy with soulful brown eyes - moral, empathetic and gentle. Captain of the high school wrestling team and nominated to the National Honor Society, he was also a diligent student with high-achieving friends who knew they could call him at 2 a.m. if they needed a favor. &quot;Saving lives brings me joy,&quot; he once tweeted of why he became a lifeguard. But now Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sits accused of violently ending several lives, maiming others and inflicting terror with homemade bombs during the Boston Marathon on April 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far south of Boston, in Sanford, Fla., under different circumstances, a young man triggered unwarranted alarm in February 2012 merely for wearing a hoodie and walking in a gated community where an onlooker assumed he had no right to be. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because George Zimmerman felt uncomfortable with the young man's appearance, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin ended up dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cases, both of which have triggered outrage, have one critical thing in common. Both show how lethally wrong we can be when we try to predict people's behavior according to the stories and stereotypes we've recorded in our heads about how they should or shouldn't look or act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I share the outrage over the fact that the killer of an unarmed black man doing nothing wrong got off without criminal sanction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the outrage over a Rolling Stone magazine cover photo said to glamorize Tsarnaev is misplaced. In running that rock star-like picture of an accused bomber, Rolling Stone was making precisely this point: Appearances can lie, and terrorists don't necessarily come packaged in long beards as recluses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They can be the popular all-American athlete who smokes dope. They can embrace popular culture. They can even be hunks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on his appearance and what little people knew of him, &quot;terrorist&quot; would not have been an outcome predicted for Tsarnaev.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not that the friends, teachers and other acquaintances lied. It's that they missed a side he worked to conceal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was, concluded the Rolling Stone article, a &quot;deeply fractured boy&quot; who didn't start out believing in radical rhetoric, but, &quot;As each small disappointment wore on his family, ultimately ripping them apart, it also furthered Jahar's (his nickname) own disintegration - a series of quiet yet powerful body punches. No one saw a thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had closer attention been paid to the subtler clues Tsarnaev gave out - his sudden embrace of Islam, his contention that 9/11 was &quot;an inside job&quot; and the fact that non-Muslim friends were rarely allowed into his family's apartment, people might have noticed the widening double life he led.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had they observed his gradual process of alienation, disconnectedness and anger, they might have worried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who study terrorists say this is how it most often happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rather than say, 'I'm lost, I've got a problem,' it's much easier to find a convenient enemy or scapegoat,&quot; Rolling Stone quotes Tom Neer, a retired FBI agent and now counterterrorism adviser, as saying. &quot;The justification comes later - say, U.S. imperialism or whatever. It's the explanation that is key.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's important, says Neer, &quot;is looking past their exterior and getting access to that interior.&quot; Who's to say if closer attention to Tsarnaev might have saved the Boston Marathon victims?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our justice system isn't supposed to throw people in jail on mere suspicions. But if those close to him had been attuned and concerned enough about his anger and angst to try and get him help, they might inadvertently have prevented the horrible upshot. Instead, they deferred to outside appearances: The guy was chill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is absolutely clear is that had George Zimmerman not jumped to conclusions about a black kid wearing a hoodie, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would still be alive. If there is a lesson to be learned from both tragedies - one of missed clues, the other of overreaction - it's that both kinds of presumptions, about who looks like one of the guys and who doesn't, can be fatally flawed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Profiling leaves innocent people dead. It lets us ignore warning signs of explosive rage brewing in someone close to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It even, as we have learned, failed to predict a future president. We must stop relying on it.</SPAN></P>
