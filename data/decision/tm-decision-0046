<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI BEACH, Fla. | Backlash from the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin echoed across Florida on Monday with a call from the leader of a black lawyers' organization to repeal the state's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law or face a possible economic boycott. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are asking the Legislature to turn the pain that parents are feeling into a simple plan - so that our youth will come home every night,&quot; said John Page, president of the National Bar Association, an organization that represents African-American lawyers and judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing beside Page during a news conference at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach was Sybrina Fulton, mother of the 17-year-old Miami Gardens youth who was killed by Zimmerman in Sanford in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing about this law is (that) I think it assisted the person who killed my son to get away with murder,&quot; Fulton said. &quot;That has to change. We have to change these laws so it doesn't happen to someone else's child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the law is not scrapped or amended, said Page, &quot;Tourism, one of the lifelines of the state, will be impacted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicki Grossman, president of the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention and Visitors Bureau, said a proposed boycott &quot;just doesn't make sense. The first line of damage is to African-American-owned businesses who are sharing in the profitability of tourism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, was charged with second-degree murder in Martin's death. His July 13 acquittal sparked outrage and expressions of dismay from many quarters, including the White House.</SPAN></P>
