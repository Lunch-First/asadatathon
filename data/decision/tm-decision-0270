<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO, Fla. | The second juror from the George Zimmerman trial to speak publicly told ABC's Robin Roberts she thought Zimmerman was guilty and that he &quot;got away with murder.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B-29, the only minority juror from the controversial trial, is identified only as &quot;Maddy&quot; during her interview, which is detailed at abcnews.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The names of the jurors have not yet been made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told court officials during jury selection that she is a certified nursing assistant in an Alzheimer's ward. She is 36 years old, Puerto Rican, married and has several children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She lived in Chicago at the time Zimmerman shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roberts conducted the interview with &quot;Maddy&quot; on Thursday morning after &quot;Good Morning America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a recap of the interview on abcnews.com, Maddy told Roberts: &quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God. And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maddy&quot; said when she and her fellow jurors began deliberations, she favored convicting Zimmerman of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on the second day of deliberations, Maddy said, she realized there wasn't enough evidence to convict Zimmerman of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's where I felt confused, where if a person kills someone, then you get charged for it,&quot; Maddy told Roberts. &quot;But as the law was read to me, if you have no proof that he killed him intentionally, you can't say he's guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maddy said she feels that she owes an apology to Trayvon's parents because she feels &quot;like I let them down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Maddy explained how the jury arrived at its acquittal: &quot;You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,&quot; she said. &quot;But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first portions of the interview will air on &quot;World News With Diane Sawyer&quot; on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More of the exclusive interview will be seen Thursday night on &quot;Nightline.&quot; The full interview will air Friday on &quot;Good Morning America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maddy is represented by attorney David Chico of Celebration, Fla. Attempts to reach him Thursday were not immediately successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first juror to talk to the press was B-37, who was photographed in shadows when she spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unknown when the juror names will be revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were granted anonymity because of the high-profile nature of the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys have asked Circuit Judge Debra Nelson to extend that anonymity for six months. She has made no ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media attorneys have opposed the idea, saying that to assure that trials remain an open and public process juror names should not be kept secret.</SPAN></P>
