OROVILLE   The Butte County NAACP will host a march for justice this morning in Oroville to address the recent verdict in the TrayvonMartin killing, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on voters' rights and other issues. 
The march will be at 9 a.m., starting from the northwest corner of the Home Depot parking lot, at the corner of Third Street and Nelson Avenue, to an area at the Butte County Courthouse.
NAACP President Irma Jordan said in an e-mail that the march is regarding George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of then-17-year-old TrayvonMartin, Stand Your Ground laws, racial and other profiling and the Supreme Court's removal of Section 4 from the Voters Rights Bill.
Jordan also said the group wants to look into local laws.
