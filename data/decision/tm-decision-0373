<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Z, Madonna and Justin Timberlake are not joining Stevie Wonder in protest of Florida's controversial Stand Your Ground law, despite contrary reports. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevie Wonder announced his decision to protest the state's controversial Stand Your Ground Law by taking the unique stance earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation is blamed by critics for causing upset in the acquittal of accused murderer George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 29-year-old was recently cleared of all charges in the shooting death of an unarmed teenager, Trayvon Martin, whom Zimmerman gunned down on the teen's walk home in Sanford, Florida last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent reports suggested Jay, Madonna, Justin, as well as Kanye West, The Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart, Usher and Rihanna, had joined Stevie in the fight by refusing to play in the state until the law is abolished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list of stars supporting the Superstition hitmaker was initially published by the American Urban Radio Networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, representatives for the aforementioned trio insist the reports are baseless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know where this list came from,&quot; one representative told Variety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevie announced his efforts while performing in Quebec City last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I decided today that until the Stand Your Ground law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again,&quot; he proclaimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the hitmaker has yet to offer further comment on the boycott.</SPAN></P>
