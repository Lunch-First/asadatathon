<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO, Fla. -- The second juror to speak publicly told ABC News in an interview made available Thursday that she feels George Zimmerman got away with murder for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, but that there wasn't enough evidence at trial to convict him under Florida law. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- President Barack Obama vowed on Thursday to use his executive powers to bypass bottlenecks in Congress and accelerate infrastructure projects to bolster growth and add jobs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dish TV ad skipper upheld</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN FRANCISCO -- Efforts by television networks to stop the Dish Network from supplying its customers an automatic ad-skipping device were dealt another setback Wednesday when a federal appeals court declined to issue a preliminary injunction against Dish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's ruling last fall and lent further support to Dish as it markets the Hopper, a digital video recorder that comes with the ad-skipping feature, which has the potential to undermine the television advertising business. The Fox network, which sought the initial injunction and then appealed, said it was disappointed by the second loss in court and would &quot;review all of our options.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Election Commission said Thursday that legally married same-sex couples must be treated in the same manner as opposite-sex couples under election law, reversing its position in response to the Supreme Court's ruling last month that struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act. ...

Anthony Weiner, the embattled candidate for mayor of New York City, acknowledged Thursday that he had engaged in inappropriate online communications with up to three women since leaving Congress two years ago.</SPAN></P>
