<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The July 20 Herald proclaims&quot;Home prices up, inventory down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not good news for us or our maturing youth who are in a bind due to lack of earnings to meet local rents. Some double up in housing or live in their cars and vans for a while. They may have to leave the area and this results in a loss of community and quality of life for everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoning change could allow smaller, more affordable, environment friendly &quot;micro-houses.&quot; Four micro-houses would fit on a lot originally planned for one older-style house. In some areas, micro-house villages at the edge of town would be a way to grow our communities. With mini-garden plots and moped pathways alongside bike and hiking paths, it could be a very attractive alternative to more million-dollar houses. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">End racial bickering over Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish people would end their bickering over the race issue involving the George Zimmerman trial. It is destructive to social cohesion and damages race relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, one side in the debate wants to gain political brownie points. They need to sit down and look at the facts concerning race. Zimmerman is not only half-Hispanic, but has black family members (Afro-Peruvian roots), some who have lived with him. He is a registered Democrat who voted and campaigned for President Barack Obama. Zimmerman has mentored underprivileged black children, dated and took a black girl to the prom. He partnered with a black in an insurance company venture in Florida. He even organized a campaign to assist a homeless black man who was beaten by a white bully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, what is all the fuss about race? I think some people are trying to use race for their own personal advantage, to gain moral and financial support for their causes. They somehow feel justified in overlooking the facts to get what they want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, their actions are stirring up racial tensions and disharmony. This is the real tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawrence Samuels<BR>Carmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe it's time to outlaw hoodies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So many mistakes were made in the Trayvon Martin case on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After reading of thedemonstration in Seaside on July 20 about some demonstrators wearing black hoodies, as was Martin, it made me stop and think that maybe we should enact a law making the sale and wearing of black hoodies illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost every crime that you read about anymore, especially in Salinas, the suspect was wearing a black hoodie. The crime rate across the nation would probably drop and young men like Martin might not look quite as suspicious, regardless of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Egbert<BR>Seaside</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Might be better to pay the fine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am confused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am of mixed heritage. My grandfather was Hispanic from Puerto Rico. My grandmother looked Chinese but said she descended from African slaves. My mother was from Queens and was definitely Jewish, and my dad was Germanic or maybe French.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you look at me, you can't tell what race I am. Some people think I actually look Arabic until they see my last name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My question is this: If I am stopped by the police for going over the speed limit, what are my options? Can I claim racial profiling? If so, what race am I? Should I call the American Civil Liberties Union, the Anti-Defamation League, the United Arabic Federation, the NAACP or League of United Latin American Citizens?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or should I just pay the speeding ticket?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman shouldn't have gotten off</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't matter whether George Zimmerman is a Catholic or a Jew or a Zoroastrian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He chased down an innocent kid and killed him for no reason that you would accept if that had been your kid. And the law let him off scot-free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That needs to be fixed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skip Seibel<BR>Pacific Grove</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks still making massive profits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is time,&quot;writes Jim Leinenkugel on July 21 , &quot;for Congress and the administration to get out of the way and eliminate the bureaucratic stranglehold they place on our economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strangleholds are unpleasant. Fortunately, though, this one would seem to lack muscle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second quarter of 2013, the nation's six largest banks reported profits of $27 billion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Misconceptions about Stevenson's stay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your otherwise nicely presentedJuly 21 supplement &quot;Living Here&quot; contains one glaring piece of misinformation: the long-discredited claim that Robert Louis Stevenson began writing &quot;Treasure Island&quot; during his stay here in 1879. It simply isn't true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austin Strong, Stevenson's stepgrandson, became so irritated by the issue that he penned a strongly-worded letter to state parks in the 1940s, demanding its people stop making the claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, interpreters and docents for state parks are excellent sources for accurate, reliable information about all things Stevenson, including how he came to write &quot;Treasure Island.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a fascinating story, but it took place well after he left Monterey.</SPAN></P>
