**Le Show**(KCSN), the long-running brainchild of US actor and impressionist Harry Shearer, is a difficult programme to review. Much like Seinfeld, which tapped into a similarly sardonic strain of American humour, it's not really about anything in particular. Tune into it at any random moment and it'll take you a while to settle into its stop-start groove.
The hugely talented Shearer has enjoyed a lucrative career. He voices Mr Burns, Ned Flanders, Principal Skinner, Kent Brockman and dozens of others on The Simpsons, for which he gets paid $300,000 per episode. He also played walrus-faced bass player Derek Smalls ("I've taken acid 75, no, 76 times . . . so I've had my moments in the sky") in This Is Spinal Tap, and was a leading light in the glory days of Saturday Night Live. 
Le Show is his weekly personal playpen. A tapas menu in radio form, it hops from comedy sketches to news items, niche slots, meandering monologues and snippets of music (usually jazz). It typifies the in-out-shake-it-all-about format favoured by, among others, Danny Baker when he was running amok at the BBC.
Last weekend's Le Show was recorded not in Shearer's home of LA, but in Britain, and there was a distinct environmentalist tint to the programme. His news monologue covered Barclays Bank's manipulation of electric power prices in California; Britain's ongoing wayward weather (this was two days before huge downpours flooded large tracts of the country); the threat of drought in the US due to water shortages; and the logistical nightmares of Afghanistan's reconstruction.
I got the feeling that this was a starchier and worthier than usual edition of Le Show. But the dagger of derision was unsheathed numerous times. There was a withering riff on Rupert Murdoch's inability to shake off the phone-hacking scandal ("NiceCorp" drawled Shearer, "nice people doing nice things"), and an acerbic comparison of Ed Snowden's situation to that of Robert Seldon Lady, a rogue CIA operative just returned to the US. Shearer squeezed the maximum comedic mileage out of the man's name without poking fun at it outright.
Shearer's speaking voice is essentially an unexaggerated Kent Brockman, and he also likes to drop in long, hanging pauses for effect, as Kent does -- making you feel as if you're watching a Simpsons news bulletin, which may or may not be the desired effect.
Le Show ran for nearly three decades on Californian station KCRW, which last April made it webcast-only, much to Shearer's annoyance. He now signs off each week by harrumphing that the programme has been brought to us "by the Change Is Hard Radio Network".
Certain parts of Le Show tend to drag, and chopping off 10 or 15 minutes would do a lot for its focus. But when it's good, it's extremely good. You can listen to it at kcsn.org/programs/le-show.

What is it with our drivetime shows and their inexplicable fondness for US conservatives? The Right Hook has Michael Graham, of whom no more need be said, while **The Last Word**(Today FM) gives Cal Thomas a prime slot once a week. Do these lads come with a tax break or something?
Thomas is less preposterous than Graham, which is like saying parsnips are better than turnips. A Bill O'Reillyesque figure in his 60s, he's a regular presence on Fox News and writes books with titles like The Death Of Ethics In America. He was initially restrained last Tuesday when analysing the bankruptcy of Detroit, content to recommend a strong dose of Chicago School of Economics elixir to save the city.
Talk then turned to the Trayvon Martin case. Here, normal service was dispiritingly and wearyingly resumed, with Thomas accusing "so-called civil rights leaders" of "stirring the pot" and "keeping [Americans] racially divided". If The Last Word and its Newstalk rival can't find more clued-up voices than these to commentate on America, they're not trying hard enough.
