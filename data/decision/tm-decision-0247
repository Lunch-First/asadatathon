<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A second juror in the trial of George Zimmerman has given a TV interview saying the former neighborhood watch volunteer &quot;got away with murder&quot; when he was acquitted earlier this month in the shooting death of black, unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman, identified  as juror B29, who is part Hispanic, said she would have liked to convict Zimmerman of murdering Martin but said her hands were tied by a lack of evidence. &quot;You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,&quot; she told ABC  in an interview due to be aired on this  morning. &quot;But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence.&quot; - (Reuters) </SPAN></P>
