MIAMI (AP) - A juror says she feels like she let Trayvon Martin's parents down by agreeing to acquit George Zimmerman in the teen's fatal shooting. 
In a taped interview aired Friday on ABC's "Good Morning America," juror B29 said jurors couldn't find enough evidence under Florida law to convict the neighborhood watch volunteer in the February 2012 death.
The juror agreed to let ABC show her face and use her first name, Maddy. She says she "fought to the end" but stands by the verdict returned earlier this month by the six-member, all-woman jury.
The 36-year-old Puerto Rican mother says the decision was difficult.
But the juror said she wants Martin's mother to know that her son will always be in her heart.
