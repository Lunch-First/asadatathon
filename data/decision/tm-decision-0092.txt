AN Ohio gun group has raised $12,000 for George Zimmerman to buy weapons and a security system for his home.
The Buckeye Firearms Foundation held a fundraiser for the man acquitted of black teen Trayvon Martin's murder because they feel the US Department of Justice is violating his gun rights.
The department has taken all the evidence from the trial, including the gun that killed Martin, as part of a civil rights investigation.
``He's in need of protection,'' said the group.
