<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense of Karkoc is simply an insult</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm responding to William Hubbell's letter to the editor, &quot;Karkoc a victim of the Nazi hunters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curiously, Hubbell never mentions that the organizations to which Michael Karkoc belonged were sponsored by the SS, not the regular German Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SS was responsible for the lion's share of atrocities committed by the Nazis, including the mass murder of defenseless, innocent men, women and children. Nor does he mention that the organizations that The Associated Press wrote Karkoc helped organize or belonged to did much of their sponsors' dirty work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Hubbell cynically tries to portray Karkoc as some kind of anti-communist freedom fighter. He then cleverly attempts to take our focus away from the seriousness of Karkoc's deeds by bringing our country's perceived misdeeds into view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true the United States does not have a spotless human rights record, but to equate America's history with those who perpetrated the worst genocide ever is akin to a defense attorney defending a murderer by claiming that the prosecutor, himself, has racked up two parking violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a perfidious apology and an insult to our intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Wiesenthal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walnut Creek Note: Steve Wiesenthal is not affiliated with the Simon Wiesenthal Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida verdict was about race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paraphrasing Charles Dickens: &quot;If the law supposes (George Zimmerman wasn't responsible, then) the law is a ass, a idiot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's jury found him &quot;not guilty,&quot; but racism interprets that verdict to mean &quot;innocent&quot; in Trayvon Martin's wrongful death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida has a long history of incorrectly acquitting white-on-black crime. Racism holds Martin, the victim of violence, to a higher standard of conduct than his aggressor. This court contradicted reality when purporting this trial &quot;wasn't about race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida law failed Martin -- through racially charged bias -- when an armed white adult was presumed justified in shooting an unarmed black juvenile, when it should've pondered the legal probability Martin lawfully stood his ground, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racists employ specious speculation, putting Martin on trial by presuming he &quot;started the fight&quot; and &quot;should've retreated&quot; yet ironically declare Zimmerman had no such obligation despite being implored to stand down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tangible evil triggering this tragedy is the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) promulgated, legally flawed and unequally applied sophistry called &quot;stand your ground,&quot; which enables and encourages needless violence and must be repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Chainey</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California GOP must take heed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration system of the United States is, without question, in dire need of reform, and now is the time for that reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite past opposition to such measures, the Republican Party should, and must, lead the campaign to resolve this nation's immigration challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans ought to take this charge because it is economically prudent and deeply humanistic, not because it will lead to an electoral victory in 2014. If, in the act of bettering the nation, Latino voters embrace the Republican Party, then that would be a welcome side-effect of proper governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foremost, the Republican leaders from California must again demonstrate they understand this nation, its challenges and its people. By responsibly reforming immigration policy, those men and women will do so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrogance of red-light runners</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can someone please explain to me the sheer audacity of red-light runners?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not talking about barely making it through the intersection before the light changes, I'm talking about deliberately driving through a light that has been red so long it's beginning to turn purple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every morning on the way to work, at a certain intersection, when our light turns green, there are at least two, three and sometimes four cars still turning left on their red arrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feel free to endanger yourselves, oh arrogant ones, but leave the rest of us out of it.</SPAN></P>
