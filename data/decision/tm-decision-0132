<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 28--Dinnertime in my friend's home 30 years ago featured lectures on table etiquette, manners and the facts of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He grew up in the mostly white suburban landscape of Morris County, N.J. His mother would tell him &quot;OK, we are one of the only black families in a white neighborhood. You need to behave yourself.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She would also tell him when he was out with his friends -- who were all white -- not to do anything foolish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'They may do it, but the first person the police will look at is you,'&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's a grown man now, but still carries the burden of self-consciousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent events, including the Trayvon Martin trial, have exposed a great divide in this country's race relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's just as true here in the Poconos, I discovered based on your reactions to last week's column on the topic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This community was transformed by migration from New York and other parts of Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monroe County's population changed dramatically over the past decade, and now has the third-highest percentage of minorities among all 67 counties in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black and Hispanic population more than doubled here while the overall population only grew by 22 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a lot of assimilation in a small community, with the potential to create some rifts among different groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bigotry comes in all shapes and sizes: racism, anti-Semitism, fascism, national, cultural and ethnic supremacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some believe it's an uninformed viewpoint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others argue, sometimes convincingly, it's time to put political correctness aside and face reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What kinds of discrimination do you experience here? What's it like to live as a black person in the Poconos? Or as a Hispanic or white person?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all see the world through the lenses of our upbringings and experiences. Those events can distort our vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is, do we try to correct that vision? Or do we continue to filter reality through our own tinted glasses?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not a rhetorical question. We really want to know what you think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pocono Record will host a private roundtable conversation about the issue of race in the Poconos. For 90 minutes, we'll get together at our Stroudsburg office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're interested in participating, please email hfrank@poconorecord.com with your name, telephone number and times you are generally available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And tell me why you want to be a part of the discussion and what you can bring to the conversation. We'll select a handful of people from the responses we get.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We want all points of views represented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do you think?</SPAN></P>
