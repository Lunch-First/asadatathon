<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Big Brother is the Vegemite of reality TV: Either you love it, or you find it so noxious and distasteful it's impossible to comprehend that anyone else would willingly, let alone happily, ingest it. For the past 13 years - every single summer since 2000 and one ill-conceived February - a dozen-odd people have willingly isolated themselves for three months inside a floodlit Panopticon made to look like a home, their every move broadcast over all-day livestreams and condensed into three prime-time hours per week, all for a half-million-dollar prize. The participants on Big Brother are, of course, not &quot;here to make friends,&quot; and regularly engage in all sorts of scheming, manipulation and histrionics. On this show, when one player calls another a liar, another can safely reply, &quot;Yeah, I don't know what game you're playing, but I'm playing Big Brother.&quot; But this season, the show's 15th, some Big Brother contestants have plumbed a new nadir of atrocious behaviour: blatant racism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost as soon as this season began, close watchers of the various Web streams began to catalogue racial slurs, as well as homophobic, sexist and anti-Semitic ones, that were not making it to air. CBS has historically sanitized the livestreams for prime time: Big Brother has a long history of contestants being racist - if not this racist - but CBS has previously claimed that such comments do &quot;not meet the network's standards&quot; and it would cut them out of the network airings, leaving them to the hawk-eyed thousands closely monitoring the livestreams. Not this time. In this summer when Paula Deen and Trayvon Martin are on front of mind, instead of ignoring its contestants' racism, Big Brother has made it one of the major storylines, giving audiences a front-row seat not just to the sort of hateful mindset and speech that usually occurs behind closed doors, but to the self-delusion of bigots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About half the cast has, at this point, engaged in some kind of casual hate speech, but there are two major culprits. The first, Aaryn Gries - yes, her name really is an anagram for &quot;Aryan&quot; - is a blond-haired, blue-eyed, Texas-born carapace of pure vileness. Aaryn insists she is a &quot;good&quot; person. She has also put on an &quot;Asian voice&quot; to joke about getting her nails done; said that Helen, the only Asian-American on the cast, should &quot;go make some rice&quot;; and remarked that one should be careful in the dark around Candice, the only African-American woman on the cast, &quot;because you might not see the bitch.&quot; She has also taken issue with pediatric speech therapist Candice's pronunciation of the word &quot;asked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The derogatory language, which Aaryn and GinaMarie had previously used only in front of other white cast members - you know the saying, evil flourishes when less evil people do nothing because they are trying to win a game show - made it to prime time when Aaryn provoked a flabbergasting scene that caused the house to turn against her. (She's up for elimination this week; GinaMarie is not.) In a fit of pique, Aaryn flipped Candice's mattress off the bed for no reason. When Candice asked who had done that, Aaryn began to snake her head and taunt, &quot;What you gonna do, girl? Where's yo class, girl?&quot; GinaMarie, escalating, got in Candice's face and asked if she &quot;wanted the black to come out.&quot; (There's a class component at play here: GinaMarie's bigotry is classically white working-class, a reflexive xenophobia that's more out there but less frightening for it. Aaryn is genteel, racist but knowing enough to not get busted saying the N-word. Hers is the racism that usually knows how to hide.) The incident ended only when Howard, the other African-American in the house, carried Candice out of the room. Crying, Candice said to him, &quot;They have called me 'Sheniqua,' flipped my bed, and I am supposed to go into another room and hide?&quot; Howard implored her to keep her cool: &quot;This game doesn't care about what's right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One would think that only someone extraordinarily stupid would say these things in a house covered with cameras, where there is so little privacy that players change their underwear underneath a towel. But it's more insidious than that: Big Brother generally encourages bad behaviour, and these women seem to think that their behaviour is no worse than the standard slurring, scheming and gamesmanship that regularly goes down. Aaryn isn't hiding her true self, not simply because she is dumb, but because she is privileged and sheltered and doesn't think she's being that racist and she imagines that everyone watching at home will see it the same way. They won't: Aaryn and GinaMarie have both already been fired from their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after the mattress incident, Candice came upon GinaMarie sobbing on the couch, with Aaryn comforting her. Candice, finding almost supernatural reserves of compassion, sat down and began to rub GinaMarie's back. Aaryn took the opportunity to apologize. &quot;Candice, I'm sorry,&quot; Aaryn said. &quot;Anybody that knows me knows that just because I'm Southern, and I say things that probably aren't appropriate all the time, I have nothing against any other race. And if I make a comment that seems like I do, I don't want it to be taken that way, and I don't want to offend you.&quot; This is the kind of thing, distasteful as reality shows can sometimes be, that would be almost impossible to plausibly fictionalize, even though it is a fact of life all over America. The racist who believes she has nothing against any other race, who apologizes largely because it is strategically sound while still thinking of herself as an open-minded person, who is a cruel bully until she becomes self-pitying and defensive, is almost too ridiculously grotesque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big Brother has congratulated itself a bit for putting all of this on air: When Julie Chen, the host, spoke about it on her talk show The Talk, her co-host Sara Gilbert said, &quot;I'm happy that CBS and Big Brother aired the comments, because I feel like it's good for people to see it, and let these people deal with the consequences when they get out of the house.&quot; But Big Brother plays a part in all of this, even if it was just giving Aaryn the rope with which to hang herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a larger issue, which is how the show is cast: GinaMarie described Candice and Howard as &quot;tokens,&quot; a nasty thing to say that also, if you look over the past casts of Big Brother, appears to be true.</SPAN></P>
