THE ONLY black candidate for mayor said Sunday the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy is driven by the same kind of bias that led to the death of TrayvonMartin.
"TrayvonMartin did die because he was black. Of that there is no doubt," William Thompson told the congregation at Abundant Life Church in Brooklyn.
Thompson then made his most forceful attack to date on the NYPD's controversial tactic.
"Here in New York City, we've institutionalized Mr. (George) Zimmerman's suspicion with a policy that all but requires our police officers to treat young black and Latino men with suspicion, to stop them and frisk them because of the color of their skin," he said.
Thompson added that young men of color "are profiled, as Trayvon was profiled."
Thompson said his natural instinct is to steer clear of the topic of race. But in an unusually passionate speech, he said he felt compelled to speak out after Zimmerman's acquittal.
"I do not believe our government can fully stop racism, but I do believe we must constantly look to see how it may enable it, even unintentionally," he added. "So we must ask ourselves, when fear of young black men ends in deadly violence against the innocent, has our government perpetuated that fear by targeting people of color with suspicion?"
At the peak of stop-and-frisk in 2011, more than 685,000 stops were made, and 87% of those stopped were black or Latino. Nothing criminal was found in 88% of the stops.
