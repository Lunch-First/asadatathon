1 Fruitvale Station - This true story, one that reverberates in the wake of Trayvon Martin, stars Michael B. Jordan as Oscar Grant, a young black man killed by an Oakland, Calif., transit cop. 
2 Pacific Rim - Take a lesson, Michael Bay: This is how you have robots and monsters beat up each other and the world. Thank you, Guillermo del Toro.
3 Twenty Feet From Stardom - You may not know their names but you won't forget the stories of superstars' backup singers finally getting their due. (Tampa Theatre)
4 The Conjuring - St. Petersburg's Patrick Wilson stars as a paranormal investigator. Always nice to see a movie that's scary without being gory.
5 The To Do List - Maybe not the last American virgin but Aubrey Plaza is the funniest, in a throwback to carefree teenage sex comedies.
