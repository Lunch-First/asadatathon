<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent American case of George Zimmerman and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin brought a lot of controversy to the American judicial system. It is reported that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an &quot;unarmed black teenager walking back with Skittles and an iced tea&quot; and George Zimmerman, a white Hispanic neighbourhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Florida, met and had a scuffle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In court Zimmerman acknowledged shooting Martin but said it was in self-defence. Attorneys for Martin's family have accused Zimmerman of shooting him &quot;in cold blood&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This incident immediately sent shock waves into the American judicial system with many blacks going into the streets to demonstrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this country we are blessed to have a fairly balanced trading ground. In other parts of the world a black male walking down the street, riding on a train, driving his car is too often perceived a threat, perceived involved in criminal activity solely because of the colour of his skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black women are constantly stopped and have a body search by police officers on their way home from the beach clad in their swimwear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial restrictions are everywhere even in business trading activities. When someone faces racism in the workplace, it can really start to take a toll on their work, their health and their overall attitude. It is easily identifiable in inappropriate comments to fellow workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I remember &quot;Nivea -- my most favourite body cream's &quot;Re-Civilise yourself&quot; advert that showed a well-dressed and clean-shaven African-American male throwing the head of a not so clean-shaven and afro-donning male did not come across too well. The 2011 campaign was axed shortly after it debuted and garnered criticism for being overtly racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some businesses that truly have a culture of insensitivity. On the other hand, there are some companies that have a variety of workers from different backgrounds and ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is good for them because it attracts different racial profiles, some Indians will give you business because you have a couple of Indians in your sales team. The majority of companies that claim to be equal opportunity employers tend to moderate their business relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asian women have a reputation of being passive while African women tend to be aggressive. The reality is that in some businesses you have to employ certain races for the business to thrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This woman once said that business picked up dramatically once she employed a white manager and she went into the background. As soon as the assistant was not available, business crumbled to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How to prevent racism at work</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strive to come up with a policy that guard against discrimination and discusses racism. Racism hurts a lot of people if not dealt with quickly. Perpetrators must face disciplinary measures. Whenever possible, ensure that you hire employees from all races and ethnic groups for balance and a diversified workforce. Induction programmes must include your policy against racism and discrimination. Whenever there is elevation or rewards, it must be done in a fair and transparent manner basing it on merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Material that promotes confidence and respect of all races must be circulated. Train employees to respect ideals of respect for each other no matter the race or ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encourage open communication with employees so that incidences of racism are reported. Anonymous tip- offs allow employees to report racism without fear of retaliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Follow up on reports of racism immediately.</SPAN></P>
