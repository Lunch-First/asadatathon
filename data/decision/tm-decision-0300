<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE CITY'S top street basketball players will suspend their annual summer tournament this weekend for a special tribute series to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Entertainers Basketball Classic, which has hosted popular games at Harlem's famed Rucker Park basketball court for 33 years, said the tournament for the slain 17-year-old was fitting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every kid that plays street ball is a part of the street ball family and they are our Trayvon,&quot; said Chris Latimer, an EBC spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EBC expects a crowd as large as 3,000. All proceeds will go the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of Florida teenager at the hands of a white neighborhood watchman sparked a national debate on racial profiling. A jury found Martin's killer George Zimmerman not guilty on July 13. Zimmerman had argued self-defense as the reason he killed the unarmed teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the local teams who will take the court are Bingo All-Stars from the Bronx, Skull Gang from Harlem and Queens' Sean Bell All-Stars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Queens team is named after the man who was shot at more than 50 times and killed by the NYPD the morning of his wedding day in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just feel like everything needs to stand for something,&quot; said Cliff Clinkscalvs, 28, a player on team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For Sean Bell, for us as a program, for us being picked as one of the teams in the city,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that's a blessing and very special. We'll be very honored to play.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travyon Martin Invitational Tournament at Rucker Park, 155th Street and Frederick Douglas Blvd. in Harlem, July 26 through July 29, 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. For info, visit EBCRuckerPark.com.</SPAN></P>
