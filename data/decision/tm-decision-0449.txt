In response to the James Adams Zimmerman letter I would like to respond with an another scenario that would have kept Trayvon Martin alive.
When Trayvon saw Zimmerman doing his job as a neighborhood watch person, Trayvon should have approached Zimmerman and identified himself and the purpose of his visit to the area.
If Trayvon Martin had not assaulted Zimmerman: sucker punched him and knocked him to the ground where he proceeded to smash Zimmerman's head into the concrete and forcing Zimmerman to unholster and use his gun in self-defense, maybe Trayvon Martin would still be alive. At least that's what the jury heard in the trial.
