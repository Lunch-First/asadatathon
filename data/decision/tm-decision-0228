<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family George Zimmerman rescued from their burning SUV is refusing interviews for fear of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman whose phone number is one digit different from that of the line Zimmerman used to call police is getting death threats. That phone number appeared repeatedly throughout the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George's family is in hiding from death threats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a news intern asked President Obama's spokesman, Jay Carney, if the president was going to do anything to protect Zimmerman's family, Carney sneered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, after Judicial Watch discovered documents showing President Obama's Department of Justice helped organize anti-Zimmerman protests, leading to the firing of the Sanford police chief and the ultimate trial of George Zimmerman who, in case you may have forgotten, was found not guilty of murder or manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This innocent man whose maternal grandparents were black and Hispanic has been portrayed as a racist and now fears for his life due to the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is pushback now against the Obama Administration, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson and others determined to bring Zimmerman to court on charges that Zimmerman violated Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This pushback is from both the political left and the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives are fighting against the President's potential to override the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Party-leaning inner-city minorities are fighting for their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While conservatives are sharing research from the British press that the American press is ignoring about George Zimmerman, local papers like Philadelphia's Daily News are sharing the stories and opinions of city minorities who are sick of the big national games being played with the lives of George Zimmerman and his family while their political leaders ignore the violence that takes so many lives from their families every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what the London newspaper, The Telegraph, published about George Zimmerman that you have likely never seen, heard or read in the major media outlets in the U.S.:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman voted and campaigned for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman and his black friend opened an insurance company in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman has black family members. Some of George's black family members lived with him, at some point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman launched a campaign to help a homeless black man who was beaten up by a white kid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George dated and took a black girl to the prom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman also mentored young black school kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, powerful people say he's a racist and needs to be put in jail somehow even though he shot Trayvon in self defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the city of Philadelphia, people are angry at the activists spending so much time protesting Zimmerman and ignoring their local &quot;Trayvons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City resident Patricia Thomas told the Philadelphia Daily News, &quot;My daughter said, 'They keep going on with this Trayvon&nbsp;Martin stuff but all these Trayvon&nbsp;Martins are here in Philadelphia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon, OK, but what about Tremaine? What about this other little boy that got killed?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tremaine Rogers was one of hundreds of Philly's murder victims over the last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African American boy didn't know his killers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seventeen-year-old Tremaine Rogers didn't have a bag of Skittles or an iced tea on him when he was shot in the back on July 13 outside of his home. He had a basketball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was killed in his own back yard at 4 p.m. by two black men for refusing to answer one question: 'We cool?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody automatically assumes that if you hear of a young African-American getting killed he was involved in something negative,&quot; says Tremaine's mentor, Kenyatta McKinney, who has lost 35 friends to the streets of Philadelphia. &quot;People are just becoming a number in Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aaron Rogers, Tremaine's 19 year-old brother, said, &quot;We're living in a city where people die over a conflict, over a female, over a dollar, over drugs. It's a lot of petty things going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial came just hours after Tremaine's slaying and dominated the news for days did not make things easier for his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like people don't understand. It's black-on-black but they're worried about white-on-black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They just trying to be racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did you hear that, Mr. President? That's from the street, not a professional activist.</SPAN></P>
