<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dream Defenders on Monday, July 22nd, 2013 in a meeting with Wansley Walters, Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Secretary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE RULING: HALF TRUE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meet the Dream Defenders -- a group of young people camped out in front of the office of Gov. Rick Scott seeking to overturn Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law and draw attention to issues such as racial profiling and arrests of school children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has been attracting national attention in the wake of the July 13 acquittal of George Zimmerman, a white Hispanic neighborhood watchman, in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager in Sanford on Feb. 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's case has shined a spotlight on the intersection of race on the criminal justice system and school discipline. (Martin was serving an out-of-school suspension when he was shot while walking to his father's home after buying Skittles and a drink.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 22, Florida's Secretary of the Department of Juvenile Justice, Wansley Walters, met with the Dream Defenders to talk about how to keep children out of the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over 12,000 school kids were arrested in Florida,&quot; said Monique Gillum, one of the leaders of Dream Defenders during the meeting. &quot;It makes Florida the nation's leader in that area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrest data on Florida students</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To back up her claim, Gillum pointed to a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice report that states that 12,520 youth were arrested for school-related arrests during the 2011-12 year. (School-related includes arrests at school, the bus or bus stop, and school-sponsored events.) About two-thirds were for misdemeanors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department pointed us to the same report to show that the number of youth school-related arrests have declined 48 percent since the 2004-05 school year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason for the decline is that the majority of Florida school districts have started using civil citations for non-violent misdemeanors. The citations include penalties such as community service. If the student complies, no arrest goes on their record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being arrested at school can be traumatic. Even if the arrest doesn't ultimately lead to a conviction, it can still hurt students because they may have to disclose it on job or college applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Miami-Dade school district, the largest in the state and the one where Martin was a student, was the first to implement civil citations -- and that could be why it had far fewer arrests than several smaller districts. (Walters was at the Miami-Dade County Juvenile Services Department at the time and led the effort to push for civil citations.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report shows school-related arrests by sheer numbers and by rate per 1,000 students in counties in 2011-12. We will cite a few examples:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami-Dade: 552, three per 1,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broward: 1,062, eight per 1,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillsborough: 1,046, 10 per 1,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinellas: 846, 15 per 1,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pasco: 316, 9 per 1,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the numbers of arrests statewide dropped in recent years after the state relaxed its &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy, critics say schools have still gone too far in criminalizing typical youthful behavior. We found arrests for infractions such as throwing spitballs, hitting someone with a tootsie pop or even for repeatedly &quot;passing gas.&quot; (The 13-year-old boy busted for flatulence never went before a judge; the Martin County school district told us the case was &quot;diverted/dropped with no record for the student.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The vast majority of children being arrested in schools are not committing criminal acts,&quot; Walters told the Orlando Sentinel earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National comparison data lacking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the 12,000 figure isn't in dispute. But comparing Florida's school-related arrests to the rest of the nation was far more complicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National &quot;data-keeping in this realm is indeed pretty awful,&quot; said Kevin G. Welner, professor and director of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado. That sentiment was echoed by multiple experts we interviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, Florida does a better job than most states at compiling the data. An expert at the Southern Poverty Law Center said the state has the most comprehensive data in the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dream Defenders sent us an article from Ebony, which stated, &quot;While Florida is not alone in turning to police to discipline young people, it has the distinction of being the nation's leader in school-based arrests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebony linked to a 2013 article in Color Lines, a magazine that focuses on issues pertaining to race. Its report stated: &quot;Last year, Florida produced the highest documented number of school-based arrests in the country ,, and that number was an improvement over previous years.&quot; (One expert we interviewed noted the important qualifier in that sentence: documented. As we'll see, little is documented in this area.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gillum directed us to a 2011 report about Florida school arrests written by the Advancement Project, a national civil rights group, along with the ACLU in Florida and the NAACP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida still has the highest documented number of school-based referrals to law enforcement in the country,&quot; states the report. A footnote had this to say: &quot;Currently, this data is not collected nationwide. Many individual states report this information, but no other state reports as many school-based referrals to law enforcement as Florida.&quot; We couldn't get a definitive answer from the group about how many states actually did report data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The report should have conveyed Florida's data is the highest on record,&quot; Advancement Project spokeswoman Jennifer Farmer told PolitiFact Florida. &quot;It may not be the highest in the country but it's highest on record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found some data is collected at the federal level by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. But that data appears to have significant gaps and inconsistencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California, pointed out a few examples of questionable numbers, including Los Angeles, which had zero referrals or arrests in 2009. Broward County had 6,640 referrals to law enforcement, but 0 arrests, while Miami-Dade had 1,670 referrals to law enforcement and 10 arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter the ranking, &quot;Florida has a very serious issue with overly punitive discipline and over-reliance on law enforcement that harms children and adolescents in the state, and is especially harmful to children of color,&quot; Losen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dream Defenders said, &quot;Over 12,000 school kids were arrested in Florida. It makes Florida the nation's leader in that area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number about Florida is correct: There were 12,520 students arrested at schools in 2011-12, according to the state Department of Juvenile Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Dream Defenders failed to prove that the number makes Florida the nation's leader in school-related arrests. This appears to be a case of the state getting a bad rap because of its rare decision to publish comprehensive data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multiple experts said that comprehensive data for state-by-state comparisons is lacking. That makes it difficult to declare Florida's ranking for school-related arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We rate this claim Half True.</SPAN></P>
