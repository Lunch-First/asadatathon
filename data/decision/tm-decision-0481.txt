George Zimmerman, who was acquitted this month of murder and manslaughter in the death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, helped rescue a family from an overturned vehicle in Florida last week, the authorities said on Monday. Mr. Zimmerman, 29, helped get the parents and two children out of the overturned sport utility vehicle last Wednesday, days after the not-guilty verdict, the Seminole County sheriff's office said. No one was injured.
