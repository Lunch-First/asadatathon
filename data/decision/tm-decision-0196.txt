Manning judge begins deliberations
A U.S. judge has begun deciding the fate of soldier Bradley Manning, who could face life in prison for giving thousands of pieces of classified military and diplomatic information to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. 
The prosecution says the 25-year-old is a traitor.
His defence lawyers call him a young, naive intelligence officer who wanted people to know about the atrocities of war.
The judge did not say when she would rule. Manning faces 21 charges, including the most serious one of aiding the enemy, which carries a potential life sentence in prison.
Group raises $12,000 to arm Zimmerman
A U.S. firearms group has raised more than $12,000 to be spent on guns or a security system for George Zimmerman, the former neighbourhood watch volunteer who was acquitted in the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.
The Buckeye Firearms Foundation believes Zimmerman's gun rights are being violated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
The department has taken all the evidence from the trial, including the gun that killed Martin, as part of a civil rights investigation.
The acquittal sparked nationwide protests and calls for federal officials to charge Zimmerman with violating Martin's civil rights.
