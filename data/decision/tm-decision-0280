<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second juror in the George Zimmerman trial to give a television interview said the former neighborhood watch volunteer &quot;got away with murder&quot; when he was acquitted earlier this month in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman, identified in court as Juror B29, who is part Hispanic, said that she would have liked to convict Zimmerman of murdering Martin but that her hands were tied by a lack of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,&quot; she told ABC's Robin Roberts in an interview due to be aired Friday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excerpts of the interview were published on ABC's Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, the son of a white father and a Peruvian mother, was found not guilty of murder and manslaughter on July 13 after a racially charged trial. The verdict triggered demonstrations across the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors have remained anonymous under a judge's order. Juror B29 allowed her face to be shown but used only the name &quot;Maddy.&quot; ABC said the 36-year-old woman is Puerto Rican and that she recently moved to Florida from Chicago. She is a nursing assistant and mother of eight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is the second juror to speak in a televised interview and the first to show her face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37, a mother of two, appeared last week on CNN with her face obscured. She said she thought Zimmerman, 29, was &quot;justified&quot; in shooting Martin, 17.</SPAN></P>
