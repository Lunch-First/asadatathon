<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PEOPLE IN Point Breeze - hell, people all over - are tired of living with violence, tired of milling around at vigils, tired of wondering when things will change for the better. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's Anton Moore's theory, anyway. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And judging by the scores of people who crowded into Wharton Square Park last night, Moore is on to something. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unity in the Community, a local nonprofit that Moore, 27, founded four years ago, held a packed peace rally in the park as part of the organization's second annual Peace Week festivities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last night's rally, which was attended by a number of local pols - including state Sen. Anthony Williams, City Councilman Kenyatta Johnson and state Reps. Jordan Harris and Brian Sims - ended with a boisterous march from Wharton Square, at 24th and Reed streets, to Stinger Square Park, at 32nd and Reed in Grays Ferry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People are tired of being tired. They want something to happen; they want kids to have a safe place to grow up,&quot; Moore said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this year, he received a $10,000 grant from the Philly chapter of Black Male Engagement (BMe), which is supported by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moore said he put the money toward adding more entertainment and events to Peace Week, which tonight will include a party for teens hosted by Power 99 FM at the Dixon House on 20th Street near Mifflin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other events this week will include a peace conference and a college-readiness seminar for local youth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Everybody wants peace,&quot; Moore said. &quot;It's not just an African-American thing. It's a white thing, a Hispanic thing. Nobody wants to get shot!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ajor Brown, of 20th and Christian streets, said she found out about the peace rally from a church mailing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I sent an email to all of my friends to see if they would want to get involved in light of the Trayvon Martin case,&quot; said Brown, 32. &quot;I said, 'This is where the rubber meets the road. This is where we can start to make a difference in our community.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brown said the show of neighborhood unity was long overdue. &quot;I'm glad the community is coming out and supporting [Anton].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnson noted that he regularly turned up at Wharton Square Park as a teen for vigils in memory of youths who had died from gun violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I want to put a challenge to every young man that's here today,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;We have a responsibility to make sure that we are strong role models for these young people that are here. If we don't guide them, the streets will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
