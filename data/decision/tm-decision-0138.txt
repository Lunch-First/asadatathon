Because he's Lee Daniels' butler!
"The Butler" saga, continued: The Weinstein Co. film, scheduled to open Aug. 16, must amend its title to "Lee Daniels' The Butler," with the director's name at 75 percent the size of the title. The studio also must pay $400,000 to the MPAA, with a $50,000 fine per day until compliance is complete. In what Harvey Weinstein might term better news, its Sundance winner "Fruitvale Station," now in release, has attained new relevance because of its resonance with the Trayvon Martin case. Of course, Harvey is too classy to play up that angle, but he's not above reviewers doing it for him. 
The final reel
Sacha Baron Cohen has pulled out of a Freddie Mercury biopic because of differences with members of Queen about the direction of the film. ... The "Man of Steel" sequel will be called either "Superman vs. Batman" or, wait for it, "Batman vs. Superman." ... Megan Fox has reconciled with Michael Bay long enough to snag the role of April O'Neil in "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." ... Laura Dern will play Shailene Woodley's mother in "The Fault in Our Stars"; Ansel Elgort, who plays Woodley's brother in "Divergent," will be her love interest. ... Christopher Walken will play mobster Gyp DeCarlo in Clint Eastwood's adaptation of "Jersey Boys."
