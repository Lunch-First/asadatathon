Zimmerman verdict
The verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman has prompted many media pundits to question: Would Zimmerman have been acquitted if he were a black man and Martin were a white teenager? This is a rhetorical question, spoken only by those who wish to imply that a black man would be found guilty. 
There is an answer to this question, although most publications would prefer to ignore and bury the truth of the matter.
Look no further than the 2009 shooting of Christopher Cervini in central New York State. Cervini, an unarmed, white, 17 year-old teenager, was shot to death by Roderick Scott, a black man who was investigating car break-ins late one night in his neighbourhood. The state prosecutor attempted to convict Scott of manslaughter, despite the fact that he had acted in self-defence. He was acquitted by the jury.
What we've seen here with the Zimmerman case is a racially charged witch hunt. He's been painted as a racist and criminal, despite the accolades from a number of black people in his own community. Two weeks ago, Zimmerman assisted in saving a family from their overturned vehicle less than a mile away from where Trayvon Martin was shot.
Scott and Zimmerman were acquitted for good reason. Self-defence is not a crime, no matter what colour skin an attacker may have. If we really want equality, certain pundits, activists and politicians must drop the race-baiting before it leads to serious cultural conflict. The so-called "progressives" who've spun this web of deceit are bringing us backward on race relations by categorizing everyone into racial clans for the express purpose of division and control.
