POLICE in Washington, DC are investigating a weekend robbery as a possible hate crime in retaliation to the not-guilty verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman. 
A Bethesda, Maryland man was beaten and robbed early on Saturday by three black men who approached him as he was walking in Washington, DC.
Police are investigating the robbery as a hate crime since one of the men yelled, ``this is for TrayvonMartin'' before attacking the man.
The men threw the victim to the ground and kicked him before leaving with his wallet and iPhone.
The victim suffered minor injuries and declined medical attention.
The attack comes two weeks after a jury found George Zimmerman not-guilty of murdering 17-year-old TrayvonMartin in February 2012, even though he admitted to shooting the teen.
After the l verdict was handed down, Martin's family and supporters called for non-violence. ``It's all right to be vocal, but we don't want to be violent,'' Reverend Walter T. Richardson said. ``We've already lost one soul and we don't want to lose any more.''
