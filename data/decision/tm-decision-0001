<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Before I can move on, I'd like to know more about The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's comment that both Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman had previous brushes with the law. Some emails circulating on the Internet say that Martin wasn't the innocent child his lawyers portrayed. I don't believe everything on the Internet but would like the subject clarified. --- Theda Davis, Lilburn </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Martin was serving a suspension from school --- his third --- when he was shot while visiting his father's girlfriend's condo in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26, 2012. He had been caught with an &quot;empty plastic bag with traces of marijuana in it,&quot; according to a police report obtained by the Miami Herald. His first suspension stemmed from tardiness and truancy, and his second occurred in October 2011, when he was seen on a school surveillance camera defacing lockers with a marker. A school police investigator searched Martin's book bag and found 12 pieces of jewelry, a watch and a &quot;burglary tool,&quot; according to a police report. Martin said the jewelry belonged to a friend and he wasn't disciplined for having the jewelry, which was impounded by police for further investigation. Zimmerman was charged with resisting arrest in July 2005 after shoving an undercover agent, but he avoided jail by undergoing a pretrial diversion program. One month later, his then-fiancee filed a civil motion for a restraining order that included allegations of domestic violence. Their relationship ended. In September 2011, Zimmerman was selected to head the neighborhood watch after a series of burglaries at the Retreat at Twin Lakes, a condo complex in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
