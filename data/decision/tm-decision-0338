<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I watched closely the media's coverage of the George Zimmerman trial. I watched pundits nightly remind me that Trayvon Martin was a young &quot;black&quot; man and Zimmerman was a &quot;white&quot; man. For whatever reason, they wanted me to remember that more than anything else.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I did. I concluded that particular views of society's ills and the relative state of affairs of race in the U.S. were not the charge to this jury.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no redeeming rationale to regurgitating our grievances over matters that were of no concern to these six women. They had a specific role to play, limited to rendering a verdict consistent with the law. They performed that &quot;focused&quot; responsibility - to the letter of the law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media wanted all past indiscretions addressed by this trial. These jurors could not possibly have been expected to fulfill their pledge to the court by considering anything other than the facts before them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, if a discussion needs to occur about flaws in the system, or about how some have a greater advantage and others lesser, let's have that discussion. But to include it in the happenings in Sanford, Fla., does a disservice to those who still respect this system and believe in its integrity. </SPAN></P>
