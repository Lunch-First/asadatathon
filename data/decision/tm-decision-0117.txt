McCrory's defining month
August will be a defining month for our new governor. The state legislature passed a large number of bills in July. We voted in a conservative Republican majority, so it comes as no surprise that most of the bills reverse long-standing laws enacted by Democrats. 
Pat McCrory ran as a Republican moderate, a fiscal conservative to be sure, but a moderate otherwise. He made us campaign promises to that effect. Though we are a "red" state in the media's eyes, most North Carolinians consider themselves middle America, leaning right on some topics and left on others. Our governor now has the opportunity with his pen to sign into law or veto bills that reflect our moderate values.
Now is your chance to speak up. The bill reducing corporate tax rates to attract businesses to North Carolina is now law. Call or email Gov. Pat McCory this week and let your opinions be known on city rights, education funding, early voting, living wage and environmental deregulation. Call the governor's office at 919-814-2000 or email via www.governor.state.nc.us/contact.

Deliberate obfuscation?
I want to thank Arlene Machen for her perceptive response to the letter by Paul Richardson in The Herald-Sun Saturday, but there's another important point to make about that letter.
Mr. Richardson said that TrayvonMartin had been suspended from school because he was found to be in possession of burglary tools. Being unsure of what "burglary tools" meant, I consulted the Internet and learned the "burglary tool" in question was a flat-head screwdriver discovered in Trayvon's backpack.
So why did Mr. Richardson use the ambiguous term "burglary tool" instead of the more descriptive "flat head screwdriver"? Could it have been a deliberate obfuscation in order to demonize the victim of a vigilante killing?
