MIAMI BEACH, Fla. | Backlash from the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin echoed across Florida on Monday with a call from the leader of a black lawyers' organization to repeal the state's "stand your ground" law or face a possible economic boycott. 
"We are asking the Legislature to turn the pain that parents are feeling into a simple plan - so that our youth will come home every night," said John Page, president of the National Bar Association, an organization that represents African-American lawyers and judges.
Standing beside Page during a news conference at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach was Sybrina Fulton, mother of the 17-year-old Miami Gardens youth who was killed by Zimmerman in Sanford in February 2012.
"The thing about this law is (that) I think it assisted the person who killed my son to get away with murder," Fulton said. "That has to change. We have to change these laws so it doesn't happen to someone else's child."
If the law is not scrapped or amended, said Page, "Tourism, one of the lifelines of the state, will be impacted."
Nicki Grossman, president of the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention and Visitors Bureau, said a proposed boycott "just doesn't make sense. The first line of damage is to African-American-owned businesses who are sharing in the profitability of tourism."
Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, was charged with second-degree murder in Martin's death. His July 13 acquittal sparked outrage and expressions of dismay from many quarters, including the White House.
