<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Description: What do Tremar Boggs and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin have in common? Young black males between the ages of 15-18. Well, one is being held out as a hero (as he should) and the other was profiled as a thug and criminal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hero sped through the neighborhood watching over a part of a community and possibly saved a life or halted a possible sexual assault. Both were just enjoying their respective communities, but one was shot dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you think these scenarios are different, I say you should think again. Sorry thing about attitudes is that these incidents are interchangeable, and if Tremar was in Trayvon's place, he would be dead, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Tremar did is what community watch is about, looking after the neighborhood and, &quot;reporting&quot; crime, not causing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until communities get on the same page, the death of young black males will continue. Much of this has to do with who molds our judicial system. Take a look around the Lancaster County Courthouse, sheriff and police department's diversity, it's almost laughable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Go to the courthouse and listen to testimony in court. You may be surprised how much perjury is presented and tolerated in the halls of justice, and by what side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the media does not always give true and full stories of the judicial system in our town, only the so-called juicy parts, and we know who does not benefit from that! If you don't know, please ask somebody.</SPAN></P>
