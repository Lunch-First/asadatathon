<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A FLORIDA couple rescued from an overturned SUV by George Zimmerman last week has cancelled a news conference over concerns about being associated with Trayvon Martin's killer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman helped pull Mark and Dana Gerstle and their two children out of a rolled vehicle unharmed last week at Sanford, near the spot where Martin was shot.</SPAN></P>
