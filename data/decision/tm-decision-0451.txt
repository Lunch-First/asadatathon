-Working people are about to get it stuck to them again on taxes for road repair. They are loading up these meetings with paving companies so they are going to recommend higher taxes on the working people instead of making coal companies pay their share since they do most of the damage.
-I'm sorry, but anyone who follows someone carrying a gun and is confronted by that individual does not have the right to kill him for any reason. A clear case of second-degree murder. 
-Why does Chesapeake keep blowing their fire alarm when the other towns don't?
-With a declining student population, the Kanawha County school system should be required to submit to an independent audit before requesting more millions of dollars of taxpayers' money.
-State, county and city officials need to look into the traffic situation at the Nitro Pilot truck stop. Any time traffic from the truck stop backs up the interstate exit ramp, Pilot needs to be fined. Local drivers are inconvenienced by it every day.
-Anyone who believes that President Obama is a bigger spender than George W. Bush apparently failed math in high school.
-First a police chief and prosecutor said no crime was committed. Then a jury said there was no crime. Only thing that is gong to appease some people is to see Zimmerman lynched.
-Drug testing for unemployment benefits, but not welfare. Drug testing to build a school, but not to teach the children. Text while driving, get pulled over, unless you're a cop. Am I the only one seeing a double standard here?
-Liberal hypocrisy. They feel a woman should have the right do anything she wants with her body, but a business owner shouldn't have the right to decide how to run his or her business.
-My messages to my fellow West Virginians: I urge everyone to watch our president's full remarks about the Trayvon Martin case. I am proud that Mr. Obama is our president because he is an intelligent, eloquent and insightful man.
-Has anybody counted how many times Anderson Cooper and Piers Morgan have asked: "was race an issue?" over the last week. At once every 5 minutes every hour, I estimate 168 times.
-I understand why there would be calls for "justice" when a black man is killed by someone who is not black. What I don't understand is why, when a black man kills another black man, they say, "Don't snitch."
-Peggy Huffman's article in the Sunday Gazette-Mail was very informative and well thought out until the very last paragraph. Is she really gullible enough to believe that the laughingly named "Friends of Coal" has ever really helped, or will help, any coal miner? Especially a union miner?
-For the past week, I think we all have been reading about the Boy Scout Jamboree. Yet, we were never informed that each Scout had to pay $850.00 to attend.
-I only take the newspaper on the weekend but please explain to me why a 17-year-old is considered a child. I married at age 17 and had a child at 19, later I graduated college and had a career. But I always considered myself an adult at age 17.
-As a white American I have to wonder if the day will ever come when anything involving a black and some other race will ever be just another incident. That it won't immediately be branded as a racist act with a civil rights violation preceded by profiling, no matter how large or small it may be. Only then will "justice roll down like a mighty stream."
-PEIA just doubled my contribution rate and reports they had a "good year" that may help stall premium increases. I think they're trying to pee down my back and tell me it's raining.
-Unbelievably, gun nuts wearing NRA garb had the nerve to hold a rally near a service in Denver that was to honor those killed in mass gun violence in Aurora and Sandy Hook. That is something you would expect from the Westboro Church.
-Many thanks to the person who found and turned in my personal work ID badge and keys to the Kroger, Riverwalk Plaza office. It was a blessed day.
-A "not guilty" verdict means that you can follow someone against the advice of a dispatcher just because he is walking to get candy and a drink. After you follow him against this advice, you can shoot a minor if he dares to defend himself against a stalker.
-If Obama is so concerned with the environment why doesn't he shut down these chemical plants across the country? They're more toxic than burning coal. We live in "Chemical Valley." That's what pollutes our air, not coal.
-Detroit is a microcosm of America. They borrowed and promised more than they could ever pay. They became increasingly dependent on social welfare programs as the tax base shrunk. Unlike the U.S. they could not print money to temporarily save them so ... crash! It's only the beginning.
