<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE mother of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin said his family was &quot;devastated&quot; after one of the jurors who acquitted George Zimmerman revealed that she believed her son''s killer &quot;got away with murder&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is devastating for my family to hear the comments from the juror, comments which we already knew in our hearts to be true,&quot; said Sybrina Fulton, the mother of 17-year-old Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This new information challenges our nation once again to do everything we can to make sure that this never happens to another child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;  In an interview with ABC News, the only ethnic minority member of the six-woman jury said that she &quot;owes an apology to&quot; Trayvon's parents because she felt that she &quot;let them down&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black Hispanic woman (36), who has eight children, said that when the jury deliberations began, she believed that Mr Zimmerman, who is white Hispanic, was guilty of the second degree murder charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury,&quot; said the nursing assistant, identified by her first name, Maddy. &quot;I fought to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others finally persuaded her that there was not the proof under Florida law to convict Mr Zimmerman (29), a neighbourhood watch volunteer, who claimed that he shot Trayvon in self-defence during a confrontation in a gated community in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can''t put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,&quot; she said. &quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can''t get away from God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her comments provoked fresh controversy about a verdict that led to nationwide protests and a heated debate about racial profiling and selfdefence laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Trayvon''s parents, said the family was particularly disappointed to hear such comments as a unanimous verdict was required in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But legal experts noted the intense pressure on a lone viewpoint in a jury room. The jury deliberated for 19 hours before they returned a not guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a US firearms group has raised more than $12,000 ((EURO)9,000) to be spent on guns or a security system for Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Buckeye Firearms Foundation believes his gun rights are being violated by the US Department of Justice. The department has taken all the evidence from the trial, including the gun that killed Trayvon, as part of a civil rights investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foundation''s donation for Mr Zimmerman is meant to be spent on guns, ammunition, protective gear or a security system, said Ken Hanson, the group''s legal chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protection &quot;The Department of Justice refused to return him his gun, and he''s in need of protection,&quot; he said. &quot;The money is intended to be used for anything he needs to defend himself or his family. He has complete discretion on how to use the money.&quot; &quot;  The money could end up being used to pay for Mr Zimmerman's defence costs and fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His spokesman, Shawn Vincent, said Mr Zimmerman has been offered free guns, but such donations have not been accepted.</SPAN></P>
