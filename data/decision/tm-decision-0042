<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am concerned about the recent portrayal of the BART negotiations. In the past week, two articles have seemed to belong in the opinion pages or should have been labeled as an &quot;in-depth&quot; series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You should be covering how unions are the last bulkhead in a fight against the middle class by the privileged few. And I am one of the &quot;privileged few.&quot; I make substantially more than the $76,551 gross pay for BART workers. Yet I am here to fight with them. They should get cost-of-living adjustments. They can give a little on pensions/medical -- they should contribute like the rest of us do. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when Wisconsin and Texas governors attack unions and bolster right-to-work laws, the Mercury News should be informing Californians about attempts to strip the rights, incomes and benefits of our hardworking neighbors who help keep the demand for fossil fuels in check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Gardner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palo Alto</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fire striking BART employees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If BART workers strike again, Gov. Jerry Brown should &quot;do a Reagan&quot; -- declare a state of emergency and terminate employees who don't show up for work. Tear up contracts and redefine salary and benefits to a rational level. Call in the National Guard to run BART.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will this be inconvenient for passengers? Only temporarily. There are plenty of people willing to take BART employees' places. In 45 to 60 days, the negative impact will be nil, but the future will look promising, including a financially strong BART and a willing employee workforce. It worked with air traffic controllers and it will work with BART.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Brown, where do you really stand? The bloated gravy train has to stop.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Save us from San Jose downtown bikini bar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please save us from the kind of &quot;upscale entertainment&quot; that huckster Mike Rose is trying to sell us (&quot;Concerns over 'bikini bar' in downtown San Jose,&quot; July 29).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 50 years after women's liberation, sexual harassment in the workplace remains a serious issue, from outright assault in the military to the roaming paws of sexual predators like San Diego Mayor Bob Filner. Is this really what we want for our daughters today -- another establishment that treats women as baubles who exist only for the pleasure of men? I'm all for growing the economy, but downtown needs an &quot;upscale&quot; bikini bar like it needs another dot-com bust.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Country needs leadership, not words</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The op-ed by President Barack Obama (&quot;America must fix what ails the middle class,&quot; July 29) is truly sad. Exploiting a dubious record, the president's only plan is once again to hit the campaign trail to deliver the same tired ideas of overspending and increased entitlements. He will have us ignore what he calls &quot;phony scandals&quot; at the IRS and the Department of Justice while allowing the NSA to threaten our liberty. What the country needs, Mr. President, is solid leadership, not another speaking tour.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google is biggest brother of them all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to Google's recent fundraiser for Sen. James Inhofe, the oil-industry stooge and climate-change denier: This makes business sense for them, playing both sides of the street. Google servers use more energy, very likely, than Inhofe's home state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google has a photo of your house. They know everyone you email and everything you discuss. They own YouTube, so they know what you look at and listen to. If you make a call on Google Voice, they archive it forever. In short, they have ways to spy on you that Orwell never could have conceived of. You are not the customer, you are the product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't be evil? Don't make me laugh.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guns don't make for law-abiding society</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wayne Hathaway (Letters, July 27) writes that George Zimmerman might not be alive today if he hadn't carried his gun. If Zimmerman didn't have a gun, I strongly suspect he would not have engaged Trayvon Martin in the first place. But the extra bravado and Wild West mentality that comes from being in possession of a weapon that easily can kill apparently provided the extra impulse to be a vigilante.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if Martin also had had a gun? Maybe we would have had a shootout. Americans' fetish for weapons will not, contrary to the NRA's incessant blather, result in a more law-abiding society.</SPAN></P>
