<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  George Zimmerman, under wraps since beating murder and manslaughter charges, emerged from hiding to help passengers trapped in an overturned SUV, Florida officials said yesterday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The former suspect, who gained infamy by killing unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, stopped Wednesday when he saw an overturned vehicle, Seminole County sheriff's spokeswoman Heather Smith said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The crash happened at 5:45 p.m. Wednesday at Interstate 4 and Route 417, less than a mile from where Zimmerman killed Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman helped two parents and two children out of their blue Ford Explorer, where they were momentarily trapped, authorities said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When deputies arrived, &quot;two men - one of whom was George Zimmerman - had already helped assist the family by getting them out of the overturned vehicle,&quot; Smith said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The four family members were not injured. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman hasn't been seen in public since jurors declared him not guilty July 13, sparking protests across the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Neighborhood-watch volunteer Zimmerman mistook Martin for a burglar on Feb. 26, 2012. The two got into a confrontation that ended with Zimmerman shooting Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jurors agreed with defense claims that Zimmerman feared for his life and was justified to use deadly force against Martin. </SPAN></P>
