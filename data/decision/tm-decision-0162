<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE mother of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin said his family was &quot;devastated&quot; after one of the jurors who acquitted George Zimmerman revealed that she believed her son's killer &quot;got away with murder&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is devastating for my family to hear the comments from the juror, comments which we already knew in our hearts to be true,&quot; said Sybrina Fulton, the mother of 17-year-old Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This new information challenges our nation once again to do everything we can to make sure that this never happens to another child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with ABC News, the only ethnic minority member of the sixwoman jury said that she &quot;owes an apology to&quot; the Trayvon's parents because she felt that she &quot;let them down&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The black Hispanic woman, 36, who has eight children, said that when the jury deliberations began, she believed that Mr Zimmerman, who is white Hispanic, was guilty of the second degree murder charge. &quot;I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury,&quot; said the nursing assistant, identified by her first name Maddy. &quot;I fought to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But others finally persuaded her that there was not the proof under Florida law to convict Mr Zimmerman, 29, a neighbourhood watch volunteer, who claimed that he shot Trayvon in self-defence during a confrontation in a gated community in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,&quot; she said. &quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her comments provoked fresh controversy about a verdict that led to nationwide protests and a heated debate about racial profiling and self-defence laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benjamin Crump, lawyer for Trayvon's parents, said the family was particularly disappointed to hear such comments as a unanimous verdict was required in the case. But legal experts noted the intense pressure on a lone viewpoint in a jury room. The jury deliberated for 19 hours before they returned a not guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
