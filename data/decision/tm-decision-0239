<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman has prompted many media pundits to question: Would Zimmerman have been acquitted if he were a black man and Martin were a white teenager? This is a rhetorical question, spoken only by those who wish to imply that a black man would be found guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an answer to this question, although most publications would prefer to ignore and bury the truth of the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look no further than the 2009 shooting of Christopher Cervini in central New York State. Cervini, an unarmed, white, 17 year-old teenager, was shot to death by Roderick Scott, a black man who was investigating car break-ins late one night in his neighbourhood. The state prosecutor attempted to convict Scott of manslaughter, despite the fact that he had acted in self-defence. He was acquitted by the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we've seen here with the Zimmerman case is a racially charged witch hunt. He's been painted as a racist and criminal, despite the accolades from a number of black people in his own community. Two weeks ago, Zimmerman assisted in saving a family from their overturned vehicle less than a mile away from where Trayvon Martin was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott and Zimmerman were acquitted for good reason. Self-defence is not a crime, no matter what colour skin an attacker may have. If we really want equality, certain pundits, activists and politicians must drop the race-baiting before it leads to serious cultural conflict. The so-called &quot;progressives&quot; who've spun this web of deceit are bringing us backward on race relations by categorizing everyone into racial clans for the express purpose of division and control.</SPAN></P>
