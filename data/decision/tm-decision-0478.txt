nmsu salaries >> The teachers and staff at NMSU complain about their "low pay" and like to compare their salaries with those at other colleges. What they fail to mention is that these colleges rank way above NMSU in performance. NMSU is at or near the bottom of most academic rankings surveys. 
impact fees >> The people who want the extension to Roadrunner will have to wait for some developer to build it. The city can't build it because the impact fees have not been implemented.
hunting trip >> Why doesn't Mr. Gov. fish and hunt in New Mexico? Then the security expense could be justified as promoting the state his wife governs.hunting trip >> Maybe Sun-News should run the article once again, explaining in full detail who paid for what on her husband's fishing trip. One of the invitee's father paid for a lot of it. Protection for her husband does not sound unreasonable to me.sun-news >> The new format for the LC Sun-News is harder for me to read. The font size is too small. I find myself skipping sections I'd prefer to read, but it's too much of a hassle.sun-news >> This print is too small. We put up with the elimination of the TV Guide and the price increase, but us older people just can't see this paper anymore. Please make the print back to where it was.zimmerman trial >> George Zimmerman was found innocent and now he is being investigated by the Justice Department. Just goes to show that NAACP controls the Justice Department.zimmerman trial >> As the jury diligently found George Zimmerman innocent in the shooting in the Martin case, Holder today comes out and says Martin's killing is an unnecessary shooting. Who is the prejudiced one here?zimmerman trial >> So much for the impartiality of the jurors in the George Zimmerman/ Trayvon Martin trial. Apparently one of the jurors has already gone on CNN for an interview and now we going to write a book and make lots of money.
sequestration >> As many WSMR employees go without pay one day a week this summer, I wonder how they feel about of our elected representatives in Washington not going without their pay -- the same representatives who voted for the sequestration. Once again, US senators and representatives vote themselves to be exempt from laws, like Obamacare, under which the rest of the country is subjected. recession >> Recessions have occurred with regularity. The economy corrected itself and thrived again. This time the government interfered and it is never ending. President Obama did not save us from depression.
force feeding >> Obama said that waterboarding prisoners is torture. However force feeding tied up detainees through their nostrils is not. What do we, the people say.
