<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The predictions were dire: Black people would burn and loot America's cities if George Zimmerman was found not guilty. White people everywhere would be attacked in revenge for the killing of Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judging from water-cooler conversations, social media and viral emails, many people took these warnings seriously - yet they proved to be largely wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community leaders and scholars say the overwhelmingly peaceful response to the Zimmerman verdict reflects increased opportunities for African-Americans, the powerful image of a black president voicing frustration with the verdict, and the modern ability to create change through activism and social media rather than a brick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was the assumption that black people, Latino people, inner-city people are inherently violent, and that's the farthest thing from the truth,'' says Kevin Powell, whose BK Nation advocacy group helped organize peaceful marches involving thousands of people in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They need to stop racially stereotyping people,'' Powell says. &quot;It's the same thing George Zimmerman was engaging in. To automatically assume an explosion from the Zimmerman verdict - I don't think they understand black people.''</SPAN></P>
