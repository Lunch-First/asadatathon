The recent all-female jury in Florida has decided Trayvon Martin should not receive any justice for his young life cut short by his killer. I am sure each one of them thought she made the right decision. 
They made the decision the defense lawyers wanted them to make. The defense lawyers knew if they could create enough confusion they would prevail.
The poor jurors -- they did not know what hit them. They thought that they were following the law. They know not what they did.
They will soon find out in their own consciences that they made the wrong decision.
In the meantime, their ridiculous decision will rock the halls of America's justice system as being the most unjust verdict in recent modern history.
The simple fact is a young man is dead not for any misfeasance on his part "but for" the actions of a gun-toting vigilante. This was a murder case. There is no self-defense when one party has a deadly weapon and the other party does not.
The message this jury sent to millions of young and old, black and white people in America and the world is the same one the Supreme Court sent in the Dred Scott decision -- that Lady Justice is not blind in all situations and those people toward whom she decides not to be impartial must seek their justice through another avenue.
May you rest in peace, young brother.
