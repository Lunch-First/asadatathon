<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RIVIERA BEACH -- As Tracy Martin walked across the pulpit at Hilltop Missionary Baptist Church Sunday night, a group of boys, about half his son Trayvon's age, gathered near a second-floor balcony, elbowing past each other so they could see him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preachers who came before Martin said he and Trayvon's mother, Sybrina Fulton, had become &quot;parents to teenagers across America&quot; in the year since George Zimmerman killed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Sanford. But Tracy Martin said that outside the presence of the cameras, when he is alone at night, he is simply a man who falls on his knees and prays about the loss of his son and the recent acquittal of the man who he believes murdered him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the greatest gifts God can give a man is a son,&quot; Martin said. &quot;I lost my son, but I'm here to make sure that you don't lose yours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That statement brought cheers from the crowd of hundreds who gathered to hear Martin at a rally and fundraiser for the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riviera Beach Mayor Thomas Masters and several other local politicians and clergymen urged the crowd to channel their outrage over Zimmerman's acquittal into civic activism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What will make hell mad and Tallahassee nervous is when we develop strategy to go with our anger,&quot; Bishop Harold Calvin Ray said. Martin sat stoically as the speakers before him criticized prosecutors in his son's murder case and called for a repeal or amendment to Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law. But he cheered along with the crowd as Ray said Zimmerman had no right to disobey a dispatcher's order and homeowner association rules before he took out a gun and shot Martin at the end of a brief struggle. Martin also stood and clapped as three teens about his son's age performed a dance to the Gospel song &quot;Encourage Yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders of the rally asked the crowd to sign several petitions Sunday night -- including one calling for the federal government to pursue civil rights violations charges against Zimmerman. Masters called two 17-year-old boys to read the petition as a symbol of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's age when he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin referenced that in his short speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon was not just my son, he was your son, too,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
