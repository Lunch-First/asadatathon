First, my heart goes out to the family of Treyvon (Trayvon) Martin. I am deeply sorry for their loss.  
As we all saw, President Obama talked about what happened in Florida, absorbing national attention over what is a local issue. Every day that the press allows him to pull a Bill Clinton and say, "I feel your pain" without a challenge is a day he gets to ignore dealing with the fact that we have 21 million people who are unemployed and eight million people who can only find part-time work. The country is 14 million jobs short of where it should be and has a real unemployment rate of more than 13 percent. Even with the government's cooked books, the youth unemployment rate is 24 percent, and the African-American unemployment rate is more than 13 percent. Every day that the press allows a cynical charade like this to go unchallenged is a day that President Obama doesn't have to face tens of millions of Americans out of work or underemployed, that he has presided over a scandalous $300 billion-a-year trade deficit with China, that businesses are refusing to expand beyond 50 employees and are limiting employees to only working fewer than 30 hours per week because of "Obamacare." Every day that the press plays along with the farce of treating Treyvon (Trayvon) Martin like some modern Medgar Evers is a day that the worst president economically since Herbert Hoover doesn't have to face the music.
