Over the past 15 months, this newspaper has printed many columns regarding the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman and yet, I never read one word about the horrific trail of abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell until after he was convicted of murdering live-born babies. I'm guessing none of his tiny victims resembled the imaginary son of our black-caucasian president. 
Then again, reporting black-on-black crime statistics makes it more difficult to exploit a liberal cause like social engineering, racial division and anti-gun legislation.
Remember when Democratic congressmen and woman wore "hoodies" in memory of Trayvon? Apparently, they couldn't find any baby bonnets to fit their fat heads. Too bad!
