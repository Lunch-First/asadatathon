<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox News continues to be near the top in cable television in terms of the number of viewers it attracts, but it is near the top in another category, too: the median age of its audience is among the oldest in television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most of the television business -- the segment that relies on advertising -- that would be serious cause for concern because ad sales are almost always based on a target age of 25 to 54, and Fox News, for the last two years, has had a median age of 65-plus in its ratings both for the full day and for prime time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But up until now at least, Fox News has been more able than any other television entity to defy the tyranny of the demos, as they are known in the business. And the network, which has upturned traditions and expectations throughout its history, has earned consistently enormous profits, relying on the commitment and loyalty of its audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I don't think you can fully capture the value Fox News brings by looking at the Nielsen ratings alone,'' said Craig Moffett, the longtime financial analyst who specializes in cable. Mr. Moffett, who heads his own firm, said that the key to Fox News's continued financial strength has been ''the level of passion and engagement'' it inspires in its viewers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That translates into big money because cable systems now pay Fox News one of the highest per-subscriber fees in television, 94 cents a month, topped in cable television only by a few networks, most of which have expensive sports rights to pay. (By comparison, CNN gets 57 cents a subscriber, according to SNL Kagan Research.) As Mr. Moffett put it, ''There are a handful of networks consumers are deeply passionate about out of all proportion to Nielsen ratings, and distributors know if you don't have those networks, then woe be to you.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With close to 100 million subscribers in total, Fox News will take in $1.11 billion this year from subscription fees before it ever sells a single commercial, Kagan estimated. Still, the network faces some significant questions as it goes forward: How old is too old? And when does the issue have to be addressed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox News declined to make executives available for comment, but several recent signs -- including changing personalities for some of its weekday programs -- suggest the network may have decided the time has come to confront the issue of age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just how old is its audience? It is impossible to be precise because Nielsen stops giving an exact figure for median age once it passes 65. But for six of the last eight years, Fox News has had a median age of 65-plus and the number of viewers in the 25-54 year old group has been falling consistently, down five years in a row in prime time, from an average of 557,000 viewers five years ago to 379,000 this year. That has occurred even though Fox's overall audience in prime time is up this year, to 2.02 million from 1.89 million three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The network also has been faced with a recent string of nightly wins in that 25-54 audience by CNN, which had been hopelessly behind in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The numbers indicate they haven't been replacing the younger viewers,'' Mr. Moffett said of Fox News. Many of the loyal viewers the network has always had are simply aging up beyond the 54-year cutoff for many ad buyers. The result is an audience edging consistently above that 65-plus number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News audiences always trend old, and the viewers of Fox's competitors are hardly in the full flower of youth. MSNBC's median age for its prime-time shows this year is 60.6; CNN's is 59.8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of the rest of television, Fox News also is quite a bit older than networks considered to have a base of older viewers. CBS has frequently been needled for having older viewers, but at 56.8, its median viewer is far younger than Fox News's. (Viewers at Fox News's sister network, Fox Broadcasting, have a median age of 50.2; at ABC, the median is 54.4; at NBC, it's 47.7.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In cable, the ages range from as young as 28.9 for Comedy Central, to 39.2 for another Fox sister network, FX, 43.6 for ESPN, and 52.9 for USA. The only other networks to hit 65-plus are the game show network GSN and the rural news network RFD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The downward trend in younger viewers seems to be accelerating at Fox News. In the second quarter of this year, the network scored its lowest ratings since 2001 in the 25-54 category. And through the end of last week, CNN had squeaked ahead of Fox News for Monday through Sunday prime-time numbers in the month of July -- in that age group only, though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox continued to have more than twice as many total viewers in most cases, but, driven by its heavy concentration on the Trayvon Martin case, CNN has posted big gains for the month in the advertiser-preferred group. Last Thursday, for example, on the strength of an interview with Mr. Martin's parents, as well as a special documentary on the impending royal birth, CNN averaged 381,000 viewers in that 25-54 group to 333,000 for Fox News -- despite having more than 1.3 million fewer overall viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this a trend? CNN has had bursts of ratings glory before, based on breaking news stories, only to fall back again to noncompetitive status. This time, the CNN run has been more sustained, though even a quarter of a year is far from a distinct trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, there may be some sales implications for Fox. ''You do see definitely accelerating negative trends at Fox News,'' said James Boyle, the managing director of SQAD, an advertising tracking and forecasting firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Boyle said his research indicated that the first and second quarters of this year showed declines for Fox News in sales for the ad clients he studies. ''The demos have impact over time,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracey Riener, the senior vice president of Havas Media, which buys ad space in news programs on behalf of clients like Fidelity Investments and Choice Hotels, said, ''It's hard to ignore Fox's ratings,'' noting how the network often has double or triple the number of viewers that MSNBC and CNN have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she added, ''Median age is important For some clients, getting old is a concern. But for some clients looking for people close to retirement age or living in retirement, I would say the group 35 to 60 is still important.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent moves may be the best indicator of how Fox News is responding to the audience trends. The network announced early this month that one of its rising stars, Megyn Kelly, will be moving into its prime-time lineup later this summer; and it hired Elisabeth Hasselbeck to join its top-rated cable morning show ''Fox and Friends.'' Both women are considerably younger than the network's continuing hosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Moffett said the most successful brands always had to be aware of reinventing themselves for the next generation. He cited the example of Cadillac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It was amazing,'' Mr. Moffett said. ''You could see the average Cadillac buyer was getting one year older every year. It didn't take a lot of math skills to realize if nothing changed, one day the last Cadillac buyer was going to walk into the showroom and then drop dead on the way out.''</SPAN></P>
