In the wake of the death of Trayvon Martin and the outcome of the George Zimmerman trial, South Congregational Church, 110 South St., will host a community conversation from 6 to 8 p.m. on Thursday, Aug. 1. 
The organizers hope that it will lead to more collaborative work with sacred and secular community partners.
This conversation on race seeks to open a different premise of racial awareness, whiteness, in order to move to a healthier and more just community environment for all people.
Clergy from South Congregational Church, St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, and First Baptist Church will facilitate. Pizza and salad will be served and a free-will offering to cover the cost of the food will be received.
