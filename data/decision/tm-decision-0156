<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Attorney General Holder and everyone else against having voter ID cards because it would hurt minorities and make it harder for them to vote is just full of it. Can you say fraud? It would stop fraud in its tracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-George W. Bush and/or his wife and kids took five trips to Africa while he was president. Get your facts straight. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Anthony Weiner should be forced out of the race for mayor of New York. He is sickening to look at. Why would New Yorkers vote for him anyway unless a lot of them are as depraved as he is? He sexually harasses women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Senator Manchin made a very bad mistake by letting them fire Jorea Marple. She was the best we've ever had. His wife doesn't belong on the board. She needs to return to Washington to help him there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Obama, you are Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-My car must be racist because every time I put it in gear all of the doors lock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Why does the Board of Education keep people who have only been with them for a few months and move others who've been with them for four years to a location they can't even get to? That is really a cop out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Instead of Eric Holder doing an end run around the Supreme Court about voter rights, why doesn't he deal with real situations like the lady who admitted she voted four times for Barack Obama all on one Election Day?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The animal shelter said they have too many animals and cannot take anymore. You people need to understand this when you don't get your animals fixed or drop them around the neighborhood. I'll bet you feel good about yourself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-You can't drive, or go to the doctor or anything without a picture ID. So what is the deal about identifying yourself when you go to vote? You're hurting your own race and you are being prejudiced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was on top of Zimmerman and Zimmerman's head was messed up and his nose was broken. They automatically yelled &quot;racism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Why are Nitro's taxes the highest and their homes are the most rundown? I guess I answered my own question. People can't afford to fix up their homes or finish the ones they started two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Now we have graffiti on the front pages, so-called art. Our city is looking more like Detroit every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-President Obama calls the Washington scandals phony, but that is just what he wishes. Lois Lerner pleads the fifth. Four Americans were killed in Libya. There was no explanation or a phony one about the spying on a reputable journalist. Who do you think is the phony?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The hedge at the corner of Woodbine and Elmore streets needs to be cut again or to be removed permanently before someone gets hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I have a question for a psychiatrist. If a family member had nothing to do with two other family members in life, yet they run big flowery tributes to them on special occasions, wouldn't you say it is a guilt complex? Guilt is a terrible thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I wish they would get rid of the commercials for products like Viagra. Also, I don't need to know about someone's aging prostate problems. They might make money, but they need to be taken off. They are offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-If you think something is racist before you know any of the facts about it, you might be a racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Why doesn't the newspaper show more recent pictures of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin? He was over six feet tall and he had tattoos all over his face, neck and arms. We've only seen the younger pictures of him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Look at Detroit. That is where Obama is taking us with his wild, irresponsible spending and the Obamacare he has shoved down America's throat. It is a demon he created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Aren't there any reasonably-priced pet sitters in the Kanawha Valley? I called one in South Charleston and they wanted $500 to come one block to feed two cats for one week?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-It sounds like these so-called WVU fans who call into the Vent Line didn't even play college or high school football. It sounds like they didn't even go to high school from the mentality they seem to have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-West Virginia people get profiled all of the time as being dumb hillbillies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-What does the GOP stand for? It stands for grand old party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-</SPAN></P>
