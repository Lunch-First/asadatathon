<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RACIAL tensions in the United States are likely to deteriorate if greater efforts are not made to narrow the rich-poor divide and create jobs for hard-pressed ordinary Americans, President Barack Obama has warned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Urging Washington to give up political point-scoring and focus on rebuilding America's sluggish economy, Mr Obama said that years of stagnant wages and depressed incomes had left people &quot;anxious&quot; and &quot;frustrated&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Racial tensions won't get better,&quot; he predicted in an interview with The New York Times. &quot;They may get worse, because people will feel as if they've got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot. If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent weeks America has re-examined the race debate following the acquittal of George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch captain, who shot dead the black teenager Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next month also marks the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, when the civil rights leader Martin Luther King delivered his &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech - an event that Mr Obama said was not just about race, but more fundamentally about economic opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always remind people - and, in fact, I have a copy of the original programme in my office, framed - that that was a march for jobs and justice; that there was a massive economic component to that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When you think about the coalition that brought about civil rights, it wasn't just folks who believed in racial equality; it was people who believed in working folks having a fair shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week Mr Obama will continue a national tour to push his inclusive economic message, giving a speech in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The president has been scorned by Republicans for his attempt to speak over the heads of Washington's gridlocked Congress, with senior Republican leaders calling for him &quot;get back to his desk&quot; and cut deals, rather than making campaign-style speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For his part, Mr Obama has made little effort to hide his disdain for the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which blocked gun reform after the Sandy Hook massacre, looks likely to block immigration reform and is spoiling for another budget fight in this autumn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Congress moves at such a glacial pace these days that sometimes if you start a bill like immigration and you're thinking this should be done by now, it seems to take a year of folks just sitting around spinning their wheels,&quot; he said. &quot;There's not an action that I take that you don't have some folks in Congress who say that I'm usurping my authority. Some of those folks think I usurp my authority by having the gall to win the presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
