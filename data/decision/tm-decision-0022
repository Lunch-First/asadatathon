<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am beginning to think America has lost all of her freedoms, liberty and truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have to be the laughingstock to the world. A nation of people that once was proud of themselves, their accomplishments and heritage. We have become a nation of blame-shifters, back-biters and finger-pointers. The leaders in this nation went to serve and find solutions, now all they bring is chaos. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bible says in Luke 11:17, &quot;Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall ... .&quot; These words that Jesus spoke have never been truer in this nation than now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton have weighed in on the Martin and Zimmerman case. They have painted Mr. Zimmerman as a racist, when there is no evidence to support their cause. It would really be nice if these people who have tremendous status would try to reach out to the nation as whole. Not one of them reaches out to the music industry that produces music that is degrading to the African American community, and it is the same for Hollywood celebrities. I find it appalling and sad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the stories and reporting I have seen about Mr. Zimmerman, he was not a racist. If anything he was in there trying to help the black community. He and his wife had taken in a brother and sister that lived with them because they had nowhere to live; he spoke out when a homeless black woman was attacked and left for dead, he took it all the way to the city council. He tutored young black students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bureau of Justice says 85 percent of young black men murdered in this country are killed by other black men. That is astonishing. So when I hear Obama, Jackson and Sharpton making statements about the Martin/Zimmerman trial, I am asking myself why aren't they trying to bring healing and find solutions, instead of bringing more dread and heartache. The sad part is I think it is all for their own notoriety; it isn't even for Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chaos and division never solve anything, but keep people anxious and at odds with each other, and ultimately bring destruction.</SPAN></P>
