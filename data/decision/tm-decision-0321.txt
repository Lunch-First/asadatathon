GRATEFUL DREAD
A FLORIDA couple rescued from an overturned SUV by George Zimmerman last week has cancelled a news conference over concerns about being associated with Trayvon Martin's killer. 
Zimmerman helped pull Mark and Dana Gerstle and their two children out of a rolled vehicle unharmed last week at Sanford, near the spot where Martin was shot.
Zimmerman's lawyer planned to host the conference, but was forced to call it off after a last-minute change of heart from the Gerstles.
``The family does not want to be associated with George,'' lawyer Mark O'Mara told reporters.
A family friend said the Gerstles were ``grateful to Zimmerman for what he did'', but were worried the media would interpret any praise directed at Zimmerman as ``making him into a hero''.
