<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been said that after a nuclear holocaust, the living will envy the dead. So is the case of Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman. Martin, a young man, was shot and killed by George Zimmerman, also young but acquitted of the shooting. Zimmerman will never lead what most would call a normal life. He'll no doubt be dodging vigilantes, gawkers and, of course, the press. He'll have to live in hiding as a hermit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the verdict was read last week, there has been marches, protests and, as usual, the vandalism that follows. I'll never understand the mentality that causes large groups to smash, grab, steal and burn. As for the protest and marches, including speeches from Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, Eric Holder and our president ... it's all for the camera. The media has once again blown it out of proportion and is putting out the fire with gasoline. As long as the media fuels the crowd, it will never calm down.</SPAN></P>
