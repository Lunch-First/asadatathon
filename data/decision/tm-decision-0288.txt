Before my family and I moved to Bloomfield in 1998, I had been  teaching in an alternative high school in Brooklyn for five years.  The trial of George Zimmerman for the killing of an unarmed  17-year-old black teenager, TrayvonMartin, brought back memories  of stories my students related about discrimination and abuse they  faced in everyday life.   
  Most of my students were Caribbean-American or African-American,  whose immediate educational goal was to get a GED certificate,  since their efforts to graduate from a Brooklyn high school had  been unsuccessful. They were a wonderful group of students, who for  many reasons, i.e., low grades and/or being older, were forced out  or dropped out.  
    Our school, the Frederick Douglass Center, provided them with  another opportunity to succeed as they worked to raise their basic  skill levels toward successful passing of the GED test. 
    As I got to know them, I learned not only about their family life  and who they were as human beings, but also about the many ways  they had been racially profiled as suspected criminals and how  hurtful it was to be treated as second-class citizens. 
     These stories included recurring experiences such as: 
    * walking home at night behind a white woman who picks up speed  when she notices a black man behind her. 
    * getting into an elevator with a white woman. She clutches her bag  and moves to the opposite corner of the elevator. 
    * going into a grocery store and being followed by the manager to  make sure a black man or woman did not steal anything. 
    * walking down a street, police driving up, pushing black youth up  against a wall, drawing their guns saying, "You might be the  criminal we are looking for." 
    * hanging out on street corners to socialize since there were no  community centers for them, and being searched by police to see if  they were dealing drugs. 
    * a student driving his new van, hearing police sirens, being  pulled over and then beaten by police as they asked if he had  stolen the van. 
    Many of my students were angry about being stopped, searched and  questioned by the police, whom they came to view as an enemy rather  than protector. 
    In class, they studied and wrote about stereotyping of Native  Americans, African-Americans, Latinos, Italians, Jews and other  groups. The majority of the writing was about their unfortunate  experiences as stereotyped, black teenagers and young adults. 
    We made a booklet of their writings entitled "Stereotypes:   Problems and Solutions," and they went to other classes, reading  their stories and telling their vision of a future of equality and  justice. 
    One student wrote to a popular talk show host whose program was  listened to by a lot of young people. He told her about our  booklet, and she invited him and other classmates onto her program. 
    For more than an hour, they read their stories and discussed what  could be done to avoid stereotypes; people called in and told their  experiences and how glad they were to hear teenage voices on this  important topic. 
    It was a great project, especially because no one was afraid to use  the word "racism," and everyone was open to discussing solutions to  the problems that can arise from stereotyping. 
    This project took place in 1996. Stereotyping continues, and  extreme abuse - such as the killing of TrayvonMartin, who was  simply walking home - continues and is part of a long history of  racism in our country. It began with the mass murder of Native  Americans by European settlers. It continued with the enslavement  of millions of Africans and the incomprehensible suffering they  endured; when they protested, they were beaten, jailed and  murdered. 
    At the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, the United States  took from Mexico what has become our Southwest, consigning  the  Mexican population in these areas to severe discrimination. During  World War II, Japanese-Americans, not German-Americans, had their  homes and businesses confiscated, and they were put in  concentration camps. 
    Today, there is the demonization, arrest, jailing and deportation  of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Central and South  America, often separating parents from their children, resulting in  severe trauma and further poverty. 
    In the past few weeks, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights  Act passed in the 1960s to help guarantee black people and people  of all races the right to vote. 
    Research shows that a black person is killed by police, security  guards or self-appointed law enforcers every 36 hours; another  study demonstrates that when the shooter is white and the victim is  black, the justifiable homicide rate is 34 percent. When the  situation is reversed and the shooter is black and the victim is  white, shootings are ruled to be justifiable in only slightly more  than 3 percent of cases. 
    We are not living in a post-racial society simply because we have a  black president. Racism continues. To educate ourselves more on the  history of our country and the role racism has played, I recommend  "The Peoples History of the U.S." by Howard Zinn.  In addition, we  can: 
    * visit The Black Youth Project website, which "explores the  attitudes, actions and decision-making of black youth by including  their lives, ideas and voices." 
    * join the New Jersey- based Peoples Organization for Progress, an  African-American-led group, open to all, whose goals include an end  to police brutality and foreign wars; for jobs, a living wage and  affordable health care for all. 
    * sign the NAACP petition online demanding federal charges be  brought against George Zimmerman for the killing of TrayvonMartin.
    * make an effort to have friends of different races. 
    Racism keeps us divided and weak as a people. Whatever we can do in  our daily lives to bring more compassion and respect for each  other's race and culture is a critical part of making our  democratic ideals a reality.
