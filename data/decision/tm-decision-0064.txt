-I'd like to know how the judge in Mason County is going to sleep having ruled that the principal in Mason County did not abuse the disabled child who he rolled down the bus aisle and down the steps.
-To the reader who thinks that President Obama is making our country economically sound, you're either blind, crazy or you're a moron. 
-I get the Sunday paper every week and you have not put in there the interest rate and the metal prices. I'd like to see that put back in the paper.
-After watching the world news tonight and Obama's rating, I finally figured out why Obama spends so much time globetrotting and is now in Illinois. It's because he is not welcome in Washington.
-As a young fellow, I made up my mind I did not want to be a breeder. Too many West Virginians are breeders, not fathers.
-I saw the state Capitol dome behind the weatherman on the news the other night. Since the fireworks, the dome is dull and not shiny like it was.
-In the eight years of his presidency, George W. Bush was on vacation 1,020 days, 32 percent of his time or almost three years out of eight. As of January 2013, President Obama had been on vacation a total of 83 days.
-Quit repeating hearsay comments and research the Zimmerman case. Research crime statistics for Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman had every reason to be suspicious when noticing a stranger in the neighborhood. It wasn't profiling. He was a concerned homeowner. That is not a crime.

-Perhaps if we heard less from the old people and more from young journalists the former state newspaper wouldn`t be as dull as dishwater.

-Zimmerman is half Hispanic and half white. Obama is half white and half black. If someone like Obama had killed Trayvon Martin would there have been such an uproar and media circus with political grandstanding? Of course not.
