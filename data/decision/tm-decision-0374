<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor of THE EAGLE:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel, who loves pranks, had one played on him at his recent wedding. As he looked down the aisle, waiting for his lovely blonde bride, whom should he see walking in her place but Gabourey Sidibe, the Oscar-nominated black actress who reportedly weighs over 300 pounds, in a voluminous white gown, as if she were the bride. Jimmy and the guests found this a hilarious joke. The real bride followed soon after, and Sidibe changed her dress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laughter, of course, was for the notion that a big star such as Jimmy could conceivably consider marrying a person of color -- especially an obese one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how far do we think we have we come in conquering racism? Could we imagine George Zimmerman being acquitted on charges of fatally shooting Trayvon Martin had Martin been a white, unarmed teenager, and Zimmerman a black, self-appointed neighborhood watchdog?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are even divided in our opinions of the racial slur by fatty-cooking diabetes-med hawker Paula Deen, who made a tearful supposed confession on television that &quot;I is what I is&quot; and that those who call her more racist than they are should (sniffle) cast the first stone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking at the Kimmel wedding prank, one could decide that Paula has a point -- she's not alone. We'll see how the Supreme Court's invalidation of part of the Voting Rights Act plays out before we start winding up to throw any stones.</SPAN></P>
