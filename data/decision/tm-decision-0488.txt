ORLANDO, Florida (AP) Officials say George Zimmerman helped rescue four people from an overturned vehicle last week, just days after he was cleared of all charges in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.
Sheriff"s spokeswoman Kim Cannaday said in a statement Monday that deputies responding to the wreck found Zimmerman and another man had already helped the couple and their two children out of the flipped sports utility vehicle.
The sheriff"s office report says Zimmerman spoke with a deputy at the scene and then left. Zimmerman did not see the crash happen.
Zimmerman had been charged with second-degree murder in the 17-year-old"s death. His acquittal prompted rallies nationwide calling for a civil rights probe, and the case has sparked debate about race and self-defense laws.
