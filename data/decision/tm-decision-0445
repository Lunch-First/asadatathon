<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie Foxx is upset George Zimmerman was acquitted of murder charges after he gunned down teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, shot and killed an unarmed 17-year-old, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, in Sanford, Florida on February 26, 2012.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has garnered controversy worldwide as George, a Hispanic American, was accused by protestors of racially profiling Trayvon, who is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution tried the case as criminal profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie, who portrayed the titular character, a former slave, in Quentin Tarantino's historic spaghetti western Django Unchained, is upset by the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a father himself and the star empathises with the deep pain that comes with the loss of a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First of all, I was disappointed like everyone else,&quot; he told Extra at Comic-Con in San Diego. &quot;I was crushed because I have a personal relationship with his mom and his father.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of people across America have protested against the court's decision to release Zimmerman after his acquittal was announced July 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie is in awe over how race relations are still even part of the conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Trayvon's mom, Sybrina Fulton] never made it about race,&quot; he explained. &quot;She only said, 'My 17-year-old kid could be your 17-year-old kid.' Something the world could embrace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie believes people should remain &quot;intelligent&quot; and &quot;peaceful&quot; about how they express their frustration over the situation, as he does not support race riots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyonc&eacute; and Jay-Z joined Trayvon's mother and the Reverend Al Sharpton at a protest in New York City on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the event Ms. Fulton made it clear she won't stop seeking justice for Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I promise you I'm going to work for your children as well,&quot; she told the crowd. &quot;Today it was my son. Tomorrow it might be yours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
