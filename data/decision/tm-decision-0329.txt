"No justice, no peace, no killer police!" a crowd repeated in Santa Ana on July 18 in another protest over the acquittal in Florida of George Zimmerman on charges in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old TrayvonMartin.  
Around 60 protesters brandished signs at the corner of Bristol Street and McFadden Avenue and spoke out against what they called a "racist system." 
"A lot of this is going on in Santa Ana," said Naui Huitzilopochtli of Santa Ana, who organized the protest. "Racial profiling and racism is in our community."
A crowd of about 100 people gathered downtown on July 16 for a vigil in reaction to the Florida acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of TrayvonMartin, chanting "Justice for Trayvon" and carrying signs that read "Another world is possible."
"We felt very compelled to take a stand in Orange County," said Joese Hernandez, 27, an organizer with El Centro Cultural de Mexico in Santa Ana.
The crowds gathered at Sasscer Park around an altar with Martin's photo next to bags of Skittles and candles.
After 8:30 p.m., protesters peacefully walked down Ross, Main and Fourth streets with candles and fists up in the air. The rally ended after 9 p.m. at the park.
Protesters carried signs reading "We are human, not criminal" while chanting, "The people say guilty." A handful of Santa Ana Police Department cars trailed the crowds and monitored traffic.
