<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will the real Bill Thompson please stand up? The mayoral candidate who in May saw an &quot;overreaction to stop and frisk&quot; now says the NYPD's strategy is driven by the same suspicion George Zimmerman harbored toward Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appearing before an African-American congregation Sunday, Thompson leveled a unwarranted, counterproductive accusation against the department that was all the more disturbing because of how it clashed with his past postures. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lone black contender in the race, Thompson responded to the not guilty verdict rendered against Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who trailed the innocent, unarmed 17-year-old Martin and shot him to death during a struggle, by tweeting on July 13: &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was killed because he was black. There was no justice done today in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, in an address at Brooklyn's Abundant Life Church, he made the leap from Zimmerman's motivations to the NYPD's program of stopping, questioning and sometimes frisking people suspected of criminality. Thompson said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in New York City, we have institutionalized Mr. Zimmerman's suspicion with a policy that all but requires our police officers to treat young black and Latino men with suspicion, to stop them and frisk them because of the color of their skin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that, in his view, NYPD officers had &quot;profiled as Trayvon was profiled&quot; large numbers of the minority group members who were stopped and let go without summons or arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrast this to a May 29 front-page New York Times profile calling Thompson &quot;steadfastly unwilling to join the tear-it-down chorus&quot; on stop-and-frisk. The Times characterized Thompson as saying that campaign jousting had &quot;glossed over its usefulness as a police tool, even as he forcefully criticized its excesses over the past few years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report continued: &quot;His criminal justice platform, he said, 'isn't about running for mayor; it's about governing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the same careful Bill Thompson who visited The Daily News editorial board on July 26. He was asked then: &quot;What's the racial motivation, if there is one, behind stop and frisk?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson answered: &quot;If 90% of the people who are stopped and frisked are black and Hispanic, then there is a racial component to it. . . . Black and Hispanic communities feel like they're being targeted, that they're being targeted for the excessive use of stop-and-frisk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to Controller John Liu, the News asked: &quot;One of your rivals... uses the words 'racial profiling' . . . Is that a factor in all this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do communities feel profiled? Yes . . . But also, at the same point, used correctly, it's a useful police tool. I don't care what my rivals have said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Note the emphasis: Though communities feel profiled, Thompson would not then pin the NYPD with profiling intent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Bill Thompson uses the term without hesitation. Why? A likely answer: Thompson is drawing 22% support among African-American Democratic likely primary voters, according to the latest Quinnipiac poll. That's a couple of points behind sexting liar Anthony Weiner and about tied with Council Speaker Christine Quinn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With blacks so evenly divided, Quinn topped the pack with 27% of the support among all voters, while Thompson (20%) and Public Advocate Bill de Blasio (21%) were essentially tied in the critical competition for second place - and a spot in a runoff primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on Thompson's clearly shifting and heating rhetoric, the distressing conclusion is that he is saying what he thinks he must in order to, at least, stay in the hunt.</SPAN></P>
