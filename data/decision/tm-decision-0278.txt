I was interested to learn of President Obama's experiences, as a young black man, of being followed by security personnel in department stores and hearing car door locks click when he crossed the street ["Obama pleads for soul-searching," front page, July 20]. This surely is lamentable, but why does this happen? It is, of course, because young black men commit a disproportionate number of crimes. That is the problem, and if we insist on ignoring it, nothing is going to change.  
Dwelling on the symptoms is counterproductive. We must face the facts and work together to provide pathways for young black men to enter the mainstream of society.

Michael Gerson's critique of President Obama's remarks on Trayvon Martin ["An incomplete speech," op-ed, July 23] was an exercise in missing the point. Suppose the president had indeed concluded with a Gerson-style action plan: "fatherhood" and "faith-based" initiatives, tax credits (always big on the agenda of black youth) and educational "accountability" (aren't Republicans already attacking the Common Core State Standards ?). Such proposals would have triggered yet another dispiriting round of partisan debate and feigned outrage over real or imagined federal mandates and spending - instigated largely by the right wing of Mr. Gerson's own party. The president's message about the African American historical experience and racial reconciliation would have been smothered.
Show me a credible set of Republican proposals for addressing the problems of African American boys and men, then we'll talk.

Regarding "On Martin verdict, a stark divide" [front page, July 23]:
The problem is not "stand your ground" laws. The problem is juries. Given that black people understandably will always feel "profiled," amelioration can be achieved only by legislating ethnically balanced juries - which was lacking in the Martin tragedy.
