July 24--U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner called out U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in a letter regarding the "Stand Your Ground Laws." 
The Republican congressman from Yuma, who represents the 4th District, asked Holder in the letter he wrote Tuesday to clarify his recent comments attacking Stand Your Ground Laws in light of the Trayvon Martin verdict.
According to Gardner's office in a news release, Gardner's letter comes one week after Holder gave a speech that called into question self-defense provisions like Stand Your Ground Laws. In the letter, Gardner called Holder's comments "highly disturbing," noting that they raised serious constitutional questions and threaten the ability of people to protect themselves.
"You have recently claimed that there is a duty to retreat, but this is a relatively new concept which would be better called a duty to live in fear," Gardner wrote in the letter. "Questioning principles like self-defense will not go unnoticed."
Gardner has been a leading proponent of self-defense provisions in the past. He introduced legislation that would expand the state's "Make My Day Law" to cover places of business in addition to homes.
"Law-abiding citizens should not live in fear that they will be prosecuted for protecting themselves," Gardner said.
In the letter, Gardner pushed for clarification of Holder's comments and requested assurance that the Justice Department does not intend to interfere with state self-defense provisions.
