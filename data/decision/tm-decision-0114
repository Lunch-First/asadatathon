<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is time for good people to stand up and get involved. To quote Rev. John Guns, pastor of St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church, we need to &quot;build bridges and break barriers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guns is doing his part by leading a nationwide campaign called &quot;Save Our Sons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His approach is to take positive action within the African-American community in the spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness, not anger. For instance, he will be holding a seminar in September to help fathers be better fathers. But he can't do it alone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can congregations of different races meet to talk respectfully and openly about important issues? Can members have dinner together?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guns' church across from Ribault High School was the site of a forum Saturday evening, July 20, to discuss some of the issues surrounding the Trayvon Martin-George Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guns said America is too often &quot;painfully polarized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to change how we see each other,&quot; Guns said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discussion, moderated by the Rev. John Newman, senior pastor at the Sanctuary at Mt. Calvary, was filled with thoughtful comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guns has received inquiries from dozens of cities interested in setting up their own chapters of Save Our Sons, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few of the issues raised at the discussion:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPEAK TO YOUTH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Jefferson, the former spokesman for the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, said he tells his own son that if confronted, try to get away. Then call police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If confronted by police, be respectful, cooperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. R. L. Gundy said it seems the African-American male is an endangered species. There is a feeling that the criminal justice system doesn't work for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duval Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said he chose to speak to his young children about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echoing Guns' statement, he said, &quot;We don't know each other. We don't trust each other.&quot; Are we willing to have difficult conversations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People of good will need to leave their comfort zones and talk about issues that sometimes make them uncomfortable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, there are a number of changes in the public sphere that could be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REFORM STAND YOUR GROUND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may not have been the intent of the law, but it has helped produce a wave of justifiable homicides as documented by The Tampa Bay Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the governor's task force report, a South Florida prosecutor, Katharine Fernandez Rundle of Miami, proposed several helpful changes in the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The statute has removed all requirements of reasonableness on the part of the person who uses deadly force against someone ...&quot; she wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her view, the law may present an &quot;irrebuttable presumption,&quot; meaning authorities cannot even look at evidence to the contrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thus, a person who without permission, enters another's yard to ask directions, or sell something and forcefully opens a porch door, can be killed without questions being asked first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That person, who can be a child, may be conclusively presumed to have been there to do violence, and no evidence to the contrary can legally make a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three Jacksonville elected officials - Sen. Audrey Gibson and Reps. Reggie Fulwood and Mia Jones - have offered proposed changes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Eliminate the self-defense immunity if the defendant took himself to the fight when he could have stayed in a safe place instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Immunity should not be available to aggressors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Provide less confusing instructions to juries, that justifiable use of deadly force is only allowed when a threat is imminent and when a person cannot safely avoid the danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Require law enforcement to issue guidelines for neighborhood watch programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Specify that immunity provisions do not restrict law enforcement agencies from investigating use-of-force cases when a person claims immunity/self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of these suggestions appear reasonable on their face and deserve consideration by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXAMINE CONCEALED CARRY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Legislature also should analyze classes required for concealed carry permits. Are they thorough?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida law is fairly liberal about training courses required for concealed carry permits. For instance, it allows &quot;any National Rifle Association firearms safety or training course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's too vague. The Legislature needs to take a more proactive approach regarding these and other issues involving violence in the state.</SPAN></P>
