TO THE EDITORS:
After the verdict from the Florida trial, I heard two or three people ask, "What if Trayvon Martin were white and George Zimmerman were black?''
To which my mind responded, "What if both Martin and Zimmerman were black?" What if both were white?''
They both are American and, in this, I find my grief.
