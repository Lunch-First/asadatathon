<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philadelphia is fighting &quot;the way of the gun&quot; and striving to end violence, especially among African American boys and men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was the message Thursday at a City Hall news conference held by leaders of various city departments who pledged to work collaboratively to make the city safer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The way of the gun is not the way of a successful life,&quot; said Richard Negrin, the city's managing director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Picking up a gun offers a young person the kind of power &quot;you can get drunk on - the power of life or death,&quot; Negrin continued. &quot;That's what we're fighting. How do we get a kid to feel powerful without the gun?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is at the core of the city's efforts to &quot;get behind the problem of violence,&quot; Negrin said. &quot;We're not going to arrest our way out of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If gun violence is to be abated, officials said, the city requires a long-term, holistic approach that addresses poverty, joblessness, and the disproportionate likelihood that young African American males will be the victims and perpetrators of crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mayor Nutter, who did not attend the meeting, issued a statement about the city's multifaceted approach to combating crime, which includes coordinating with the Department of Human Services:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We know a true crime-fighting strategy cannot only focus on policing and incarceration. . . . The programs and initiatives in which we are engaged are interrelated and focused on the same goal: reducing crime with a focus on decreasing the number of young black male casualties in our city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been some success. Homicides in Philadelphia between January and the end of June this year were at a 50-year low of 115, police figures show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As reasons for the improvement, Nutter, along with criminal-justice experts, pointed to a greater emphasis on data-driven policing, a crackdown on gun criminals, and major reforms in criminal courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further, police and prosecutors have targeted neighborhoods seen as hot spots of crime, including North Philadelphia's 22d Police District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At one point during Thursday's session, Everett Gillison, Nutter's chief of staff and the deputy mayor for public safety, brought up Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the 17-year-old African American youth shot to death by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch member in Florida. Zimmerman was recently acquitted in the killing, touching off demonstrations around the country about the victimization of black youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the last 30 days, the country experienced quite a shock to its system,&quot; Gillison said. He added that the shooting and subsequent acquittal &quot;calls us to ask ourselves, what are we doing to make sure there are no more Trayvons?&quot;</SPAN></P>
