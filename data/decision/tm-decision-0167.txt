FLORIDA: A juror in the trial of George Zimmerman has said she feels he got away with murder for shooting unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, but that there was not enough evidence at trial to convict him under Florida law. Juror B29 told ABC News she favoured convicting Mr Zimmerman of second-degree murder but there wasn't enough proof.
