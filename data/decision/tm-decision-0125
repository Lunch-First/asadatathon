<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of all the adjectives I would use to describe President Obama -- intelligent, articulate, charming, good father and husband -- I now have come to realize, after four-plus years of watching and listening to him, that the best adjective I would use now is &quot;boring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, he is scheduled to fly all over the country to make speeches about the economy, and no doubt Obamacare. His speeches are beginning to sound like all the adult characters in a Charlie Brown cartoon. His delivery is always eloquent, and the crescendo builds to a climax like a July 4 fireworks show, but in thethat's all it is: a show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even his most steadfast supporters on the various cable news networks seem to be noticing that he has a lot more bark than bite. Every time they speak about him, they are increasingly saying, &quot;what the president needs to do,&quot; not &quot;what the president needs to say.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He may be America's first black president, and he sure promised he was going to be different, but other than the color of his skin I can't differentiate him from the boring, white, golf-playing, Washington elitists that have been running this country into the ground for years -- Democrats and Republicans alike. As a Republican I have had to admit to myself, and now others, that George W. Bush (though a good man) was quite the disappointment. Is it not time that Democrats admit that President Obama is too. I, like many others, am considering changing my registration to independent. We need real change!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An easy -- and almost shorter -- drive east to Daytona Beach is to get off Interstate 4 at exit 114, cross over I-4 and turn right at the first light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Beltway, which turns into Kepler Road, and takes you right to U.S. 92.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then you are home free into Daytona Beach, without stopping for accident delays or slowdowns on I-4 east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Happy driving!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman overstepped</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What part of George Zimmerman's case do people miss? He was not a cop, but acted like one. He went out with a gun to try to stop &quot;suspects.&quot; Doing that -- no matter how you may love law and order - - was not his job. Thus, untrained as he was, he set up a situation that put himself in danger. If you don't flee danger, but instead pursue it, and the result is that you kill someone who was minding his own business until you bothered him, you should be held responsible. These seem to me to be the facts. But in my opinion, I feel Zimmerman got off because he was:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A white man of privilege,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Supported by the white power structure and cops,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protected by laws that foster gun violence -- not self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of us are troubled by that, others are outraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAVID B. AXELROD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daytona Beach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Focus on preventable deaths</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The publicity over the shooting of Trayvon Martin is being overdone. Most of this publicity is being pushed by Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson. To quote Sheriff Mike Scott of Lee County, in a letter to the Lee County branch of the NAACP:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A leading cause of death for young black males across our nation is murder, and an astounding percentage are being murdered by young black males. Tragically, record numbers of young, black males have been gunned down in the streets of Fort Myers and an epidemic of alarming proportions over the past few years. In virtually every instance the killer was also black and the majority of those cases remain open. Many more black citizens have been injured and were lucky to survive similar circumstances. To date I am unaware of any appreciable attention or public outcry the NAACP locally or nationally has afforded these issues in our own proverbial backyard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they want to do some good, they need to go to places like Chicago and New York and start working there to reduce some of the killings. In 2012, there were 506 murders in Chicago and 419 murders in New York. In Chicago, there were 54 shot dead during the George Zimmerman trial. I don't see Jackson or Sharpton up there publicizing that. I wonder if they feel that those people's lives are worth less than Martin's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the way, Chicago has one of the toughest gun control laws in the country and so does New York City. It seems obvious from all of the killings in Chicago and New York that gun control is not working. If all these well-meaning people protesting Martin's death and Zimmerman's acquittal put their efforts into stemming the killings where it is an everyday occurrence, they might do more good.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Work todivision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growing up during the 1950s and 1960s, my neighborhood was mixed white, black and Hispanic. Racism and segregation were not issues. I didn't consider my friends and neighbors as white, black or tan. We played kids' games, attended school and church, rode buses, ate lunch and dinner at each others' homes. We grew up together, were drafted, or joined the armed services to serve our country in time of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was raised in the Christian faith. Because of my beliefs, I became involved with the anti-war and civil rights movements. America was a divided nation; on one side those who believed in peace and equality for all, and on the other, those who opposed those beliefs. Protesters were often beaten, bloodied and trampled or assaulted with fire hoses, rubber bullets and dogs. Some lost their lives. Those who supported these beliefs were also labeled as unAmerican, unpatriotic or traitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty years have passed since then and America has become a more united country, electing the first black man as its president. Those who now believe that the president is taking sides and bringing race into question, who believe that he is dividing the nation, are dead wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of Americans want an honest discussion and debate on race. The talking heads (the Rushes, Hannities and Becks) who preach fear, hatred and division daily don't speak for the majority of Americans. One must ask them this question: If America is truly a Christian nation, will we be able to overcome fear and hatred of people of color and differing sexual orientation?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One solution to gridlock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In seeking answers to the action and non-action in Congress, I firmly believe that one of the best answers to get Congress to do what is needed for our country is term limits. Term limits would stop all the politicking that goes on in Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elect all senators and congressional representatives to one four- year term -- staggered -- and then don't let them run for elected office ever again. They should be paid a reasonable salary and should have to buy their own health insurance on the open market and pay into Social Security just like all the rest of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would do several things. Not being able to run for office ever again, they would have to give their full time and attention to the job at hand. Politics as we know it would be vastly curtailed. Re-election is now foremost on the minds of the officeholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special interest groups would still lobby but the officeholder (not being able to run again) would be more inclined to do the right thing for the general public rather than worry about the needed money for their re-election. Term limits would change the seniority for chairmanship of committees, passing around these jobs from person-to-person every couple of years instead of one person holding the position for many decades, depending on majority party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This kind of change to our system would have to come from the grassroots of society. Many of the current legislators would fight this idea very hard, so as to keep their cushy positions. We need people in office who will do the job they were elected to do, keeping in mind what is best for the majority of the citizens that they represent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama part of problem</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, the president chides Washington for having &quot;taken its eye off the ball,&quot; declaring the economy would be the &quot;highest priority&quot; of his second term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, Mr. Obama, I've got some news for you -- you are Washington! While the president's rhetoric is absolutely magnificent, his follow-through or lack thereof has weakened our economic recovery, strangled small business, and polarized our nation. Poised to spend almost $684 million to market and sell Obamacare to a skeptical populace, the president will continue to advocate his progressive agenda despite the severe consequences to our country's economy.</SPAN></P>
