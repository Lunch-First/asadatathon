Death threats were the last type of phone calls George A. Zimmermann, 78, thought he would get after serving 55 years as his Pennsylvania community's preacher.
And he never thought he would be mistaken for the man headlining news these days: George Zimmerman, the Sanford, Fla., neighborhood watch volunteer acquitted in the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin.
Zimmermann, 78, retired to Deland, Fla., 16 years ago from Georgetown United Methodist Church in Paradise, Pa. He says his time in Florida had been peaceful and uneventful -- until the phone calls began trickling in.
According to Zimmermann, he started receiving the calls immediately after Zimmerman (with one n), 29, shot the teenager.  He says they were tame in comparison with the one he got July 14, a day after the verdict was reached.
"Hey (expletive), you're the one who killed Trayvon Martin ...  you're dead," the caller said in a message left on the answering machine,  according to a report by Daytona news station WFVT.
Zimmermann reported the incident to the Volusia County Sheriff's Office. "I know they're venting their emotions, but I had no idea that my name would create such a hassle," he says.
Zimmermann says a couple of the calls have been from out-of-state numbers, but more have been from Florida. He has changed his phone number, and since July 14, he has not received any more intimidating calls.
"They're just shooting in the dark," Zimmermann says. "It doesn' t make sense -- I'm in a different town.
"But I guess when you're upset you do things without rationally thinking about it," he said.
