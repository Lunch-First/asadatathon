<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent protests over the George Zimmerman trial and verdict speak volumes about how deep racism is in Florida and other parts of the country. Lately, though, we've seen racial hatred extend its tentacles far beyond people of color. Immigrants have become the latest target of bigotry and prejudice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tea Party activists and GOP lawmakers recently gathered in Washington to rail against an immigration reform bill passed by the Senate. The event was linked to a number of political figures, including Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), and organizer John Tanton, who has called African-Americans a &quot;retrograde species.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech that could have been cc'd from Herman Goering, circa 1933, Tea Party co-founder Ken Crow brought xenophobia to a new high when he stated, &quot;From those incredible bloodlines of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington and John Smith. And all these great Americans, Martin Luther King. These great Americans who built this country. You came from them. And the unique thing about being from that part of the world, when you learn about breeding, you learn that you cannot breed Secretariat to a donkey and expect to win the Kentucky Derby. You guys have incredible DNA and don't forget it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racism worries me, the stupidity frightens me. This obsessing about breeding is downright creepy. I had no idea the Tea Party had plans to incorporate Hitler's master race into their 2016 platform. Oh, and the reference to Dr. King? That was an obvious red herring, a kind of inoculation that gave Mr. Crow license to prove he was not racist and say whatever he wanted. Either that or he was referring to 16th-century religious reform leader Martin Luther.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Crow must be following in the footsteps of his dad, Jim. Not only was his speech offensive, it was un-American. He mentioned that breeding with immigrants was a no-no, and that American DNA was better. Sadly, the irony and hypocrisy was lost on the Tea Party leader. A little research on his part would have shown that the United States is a nation of immigrants. We are all just mixed-blood mutts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the nasty truth about immigration that Crow and his cronies like to keep under wraps. They believe that no illegal immigrant should be allowed a path to citizenship or amnesty because the wealthy would lose their never-ending supply of cheap labor. They're reluctant to change the immigration system because that would cut into their profits and dilute the country's so-called racial purity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White supremacists think they're better than everyone else when in fact they are the lowest of the low. They claim to be true Americans but are clueless about the history of our country. They have no idea that Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asians, and immigrants helped win the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, both world wars, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. They're unaware that these people built our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People like Crow represent the exact opposite of what America is about. The founding fathers wanted people with diverse beliefs and interests to form a government that would provide for the common good of all. The Tea Party (bless their tiny hearts) advocates for an exclusionary society comprised of self-interests without obligations to their fellow citizens, even if the gap between rich and poor becomes wide enough to drive a revolution through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guilt doesn't stop them. Nothing does. The Tea Party is indefatigable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to Crow and his ilk, our nation is deeply and thoroughly racist, and many churches and religionists are among the most bigoted and discriminatory of all. We still have a Ku Klux Klan and a white supremacist movement filled with members who consider themselves good Christians. Go figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless we stop seeing ourselves as part of anything but the human race, we will remain a nation of fear and hatred. We are brothers and sisters whether we think differently, look differently, or worship differently. Until we are all of the same heart, spirit and soul, there will be more chaos. The tragic story of Trayvon Martin will play itself out over and over again. If we continue to view life through a racist lens, all we will ever see is racism.</SPAN></P>
