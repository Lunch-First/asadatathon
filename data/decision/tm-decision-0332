<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the organized demonstrations demanding justice for Trayvon Martin, the participants in those demonstrations need to accept that justice was served.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the outcome of the trial had been the opposite, do you think the Hispanic-American segment of the population would demonstrate, demand justice and get the Department of Justice to investigate? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juries are for determining who is guilty and who is innocent and judges are supposed to determine what punishment should be meted out to fit the crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racism is a reality in America and people of all ethnic backgrounds want it that way. If America is to become non-racist, then there can be no hyphenated Americans. The citizens and the government of this nation need to quit allowing special treatment for race, nationality or religion. We have freedom for that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There cannot be African-Americans, Japanese-Americans, German-Americans, Mexican-Americans or any other combination of American. You are either American, becoming American or not an American, and if you are not American, go home. </SPAN></P>
