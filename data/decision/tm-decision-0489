<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MILWAUKEE (AP) A 76-year-old U.S. man who fatally shot his black 13-year-old neighbor in the chest after accusing the boy of burglary was sentenced Monday to life in prison with no chance of parole. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John H. Spooner, who was convicted last week of first-degree intentional homicide, acknowledged shooting Darius Simmons last year while the teen&quot;s mother watched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conviction carried a mandatory sentence of life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has drawn some parallels to that of the deadly shooting of black teen Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman after a Florida confrontation. Zimmerman, however, was acquitted amid protests across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Spooner&quot;s shotguns were stolen in a break-in at his home in May 2012, and he told the jury he suspected Darius as the thief. Footage from Spooner&quot;s own surveillance cameras two days later showed him confronting Darius on the sidewalk, pointing a gun at the boy&quot;s chest and firing. Darius turned and fled, then collapsed and died in the street moments later as his mother cradled him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police searched the boy&quot;s home later that day and didn&quot;t find the weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darius&quot; mother, Patricia Larry, has a wrongful-death lawsuit pending against Spooner. After jurors rejected Spooner&quot;s insanity plea on Friday, she told reporters &quot;justice was served.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spooner never denied shooting the boy. He testified, against his attorney&quot;s advice, that he killed Darius because he really wanted his guns back. He also acknowledged wanting to kill the teen&quot;s brother when the older boy ran to Darius&quot; aid as he lay dying. But Spooner said he didn&quot;t want to hit any of the others who had gathered around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When prosecutor Mark Williams suggested Spooner killed Darius for revenge, Spooner replied, &quot;I wouldn&quot;t call it revenge. I would call it justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
