<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RACIAL tensions in the United States are likely to rise if greater efforts are not made to narrow the rich-poor divide and create jobs for hard-pressed ordinary Americans, President Barack Obama has warned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urging Washington to give up political point-scoring and focus on rebuilding America''s sluggish economy, Mr Obama said that years of stagnant wages and depressed incomes had left people &quot;anxious&quot; and &quot;frustrated&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Racial tensions won''t get better,&quot; he said in an interview with 'The New York Times'. &quot;They may get worse because people feel as if they''ve got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot. If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent weeks, America has re-examined the race debate following the acquittal of George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch captain who shot dead the black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next month also marks the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, when the civil rights leader Martin Luther King delivered his 'I have a dream&quot; speech' - an event that Mr Obama said was not just about race, but about economic opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jobs &quot;I always remind people - and, in fact, I have a copy of the original programme in my office, framed - that that was a march for jobs and justice; that there was a massive economic component to that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you think about the coalition that brought about civil rights, it wasn''t just folks who believed in racial equality; it was people who believed in working folks having a fair shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, Mr Obama will continue a national tour to push his inclusive economic message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been scorned by Republicans for his attempt to speak over the heads of Washington''s gridlocked Congress, with senior Republican leaders calling for him &quot;get back to his desk&quot; and cut deals, rather than making campaign-style speeches. (&copy; Daily Telegraph, London)</SPAN></P>
