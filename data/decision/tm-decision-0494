<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OROVILLE -- People marched with the Butte County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on Tuesday to protest laws that allowed George Zimmerman to be acquitted of second-degree murder for shooting Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, claimed self-defense in the 2012 shooting of the teenager in a gated community in Florida where Martin was staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury found Zimmerman not guilty in Seminole Circuit Court in Florida on July 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local NAACP, Unit 1029, led the march. Protesters started at the northwest corner of Home Depot, crossing Nelson Avenue and marching up County Center Drive toward the Butte County Superior Courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAACP President Irma Jordan called for a peaceable march. Jordan and Pastor Kevin Thompson of the Number One Church of God in Christ led the marchers singing, &quot;We are standing for justice. We will not be stopped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group gathered on the steps of the courthouse. Jordan said the Zimmerman trial is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot go back, but we can stop other Trayvon&nbsp;Martin shootings from happening,&quot; Jordan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan said, &quot;We all have the same rights given by God, and the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict was unfair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan asked people to support changes including of the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws on self-defense, racial and other profiling, and the removal of a section of the Voting Rights Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, the United States Supreme Court voted to remove the section of the Voting Rights Act that requires places with a history of discrimination to get approval before changing the way elections are held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tim Harrison, pastor of the New Home Missionary Baptist Church, said the Zimmerman case includes all the elements required for a United States Department of Justice investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida authorities have delivered all evidence related to the Zimmerman investigation to federal officials, who are weighing whether to pursue a civil rights case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celia Hirschman of the Historic Downtown Oroville Neighborhood Watch said they do not support violence by neighborhood watch volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not support what Zimmerman did,&quot; Hirschman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan handed out packets of information people can use to protest laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seng Yang, of the Hmong Cultural Center of Butte County, also spoke about supporting equal justice for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Bradford, born and raised in Oroville, came from Sacramento to participate in the march to support changes in laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradford said a lot of African-American youth in Florida and other areas are living in fear in the aftermath of the Zimmerman trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's leading to a gateway for things like that (the Martin shooting) to happen again,&quot; Bradford said.</SPAN></P>
