Trayvon Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, will speak with attendees of the National Urban League's annual conference in Philadelphia on Friday. 
 With Attorney General Eric Holder and the Rev. Al Sharpton also scheduled to attend the conference, the outcome of the George Zimmerman trial promises to take center stage during the four-day gathering at the Convention Center.
 Fulton will speak at the group's luncheon at noon Friday. Sharpton, whose National Action Network brought attention to the Zimmerman case, is also scheduled to be there. The luncheon is open only to registered attendees at the conference.
 On Thursday from 8 to 10 a.m., Holder will host an "Emergency Town Meeting" on such issues as voting rights, affirmative action, and Zimmerman's acquittal in the slaying of Martin.
 Also scheduled to attend the meeting is Fulton's family lawyer, Benjamin L. Crump.
 On July 13, a jury in Sanford, Fla., acquitted Zimmerman, a neighborhood-watch volunteer, who was accused of second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of the unarmed black teen in the racially charged case.
 The verdict prompted a wave of protests across the country and calls for reexamining state "stand-your-ground" laws.
 U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D., Ga.), a longtime civil rights activist, will give the conference's keynote speech at 8 a.m. Friday. On Saturday he will receive the group's Civil Rights Champion Award.
 Many of the conference events are free and open to the public. Others require official registration. Details are at the National Urban League's website, nul.org.
