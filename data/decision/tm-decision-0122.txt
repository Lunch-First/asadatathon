Black Activists Rising Against Cuts (Barac) co-chair Lee Jasper confirmed the move today after seven days of protests outside the US embassy in London against the racist killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin. Mr Jasper said the Martin killing resonated around the world and cited cases in Britain including the deaths of Stephen Lawrence, Jimmy Mubenga, Mark Duggan, Kingsley Burrell, Smiley Culture and Azelle Rodney. About 350 people joined the London demonstrations demanding justice for Mr Martin, whose killer George Zimmerman was acquitted of manslaughter after claiming self-defence.  
The protests, culminating with a march and rally to Downing Street on Saturday, also backed the Lawrence family's call for a public inquiry into allegations that police attempted to smear them and other anti-racism activists. Mr Jasper said the brutal cuts being implemented by the coalition and other EU states would only exacerbate incidents of racism. "You look at Europe and you can see that austerity has unleashed a tidal wave of racism in Greece, Spain, Italy and Germany and here," he said. "We have seen a rise in violent racist attacks, the targeting of mosques and the persecution of immigrants. "We have the Tories employing Lynton Crosby and making it very clear they want to demonise immigrants in the run-up to the elections and parties like Ukip spreading their lies about immigration." Saturday's protest was organised by Barac with support from the Public and Commercial Services union, Unite, the National Union of Teachers and a number of civil liberties and anti-racism groups. The new coalition, which has yet to be named, will be formally launched in September and is aimed at countering the xenophobic rhetoric of parties such as Ukip and the Tories.
