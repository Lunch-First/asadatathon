TO THE EDITORS:
I believe that Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton missed an opportunity to further racial harmony when George Zimmerman was acquitted of the killing of their son. They could have expressed their disappointment with the decision of the jury, but then gone on to say that they forgive George Zimmerman and encouraged the black community to do the same. 
Everyone in Lancaster County remembers the example set by the Amish community in the wake of the Nickel Mine killings. The girls in that school were truly innocent children who had no way to escape the man who targeted them.
TrayvonMartin could have chosen to go back to the house where he was staying rather than confronting George Zimmerman. He made a tragic choice that night.
George Zimmerman could have chosen to leave the scene and let the police deal with crime in his neighborhood, but he did not.
The result was that a young man lost his life.
Trayvon's parents could bring no greater honor to their son than to have people remember that his death was used to promote racial harmony, which is in the best interest of all Americans.
Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton will have no peace until they can offer forgiveness.
