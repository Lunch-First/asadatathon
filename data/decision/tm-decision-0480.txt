CRASH HELP
GEORGE Zimmerman helped rescue four people from an overturned vehicle last week, just days after he was cleared of all charges in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.
Sanford police said Zimmerman and another man had pulled a couple and two children from a rolled utility on a stretch of Florida highway last Thursday just metres from where Zimmerman shot Martin, 17.
It is the first known sighting of Zimmerman, 29, since he was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the 2012 shooting.
Police said Zimmerman, who didn't see the crash, spoke with a deputy at the scene and then left.
