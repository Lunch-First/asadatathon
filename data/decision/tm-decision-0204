<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read Sunday's article &quot;Tested by tragedy&quot; about how the Lafayette County Sheriff's Department is coping with the two triple homicides recently committed there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can see how hard Sheriff Scott Pedley and his department are working. I know it is a thankless job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elected officials in Lafayette County and Madison should help them with more funding. I really think they need it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Dom Conforti, Beaver Dam</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Braun case is test of team, fan, management character</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you, Brewers owner Mark Attanasio, for being the voice of calm and reason amid the hysteria surrounding Ryan Braun's suspension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be a test of character for the team, the front office and the fans, but it is an opportunity to show the world what we are made of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, it does appear that the terms &quot;liar,&quot; &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;cheat&quot; may apply, but it has been a revelation to discover that we are surrounded by an incredibly high number of perfect people anxious to throw stones and express their hate for those of us who aren't so perfect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe they should put the stones down long enough to look in the mirror. That includes the sanctimonious Major League Baseball leaders who have bungled the whole performance-enhancing drug thing and continue to do so as the deals with the Biogenesis bottom-feeders are approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keep the faith, Brewers fans. See you at Miller Park!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Marlene Buechel, Verona</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impact of technology remains to be seen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My new smart phone is nearly so smart that it can turn me off and function by itself. It may come to that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I miss the Luddites, or are they still around? They used to wreak havoc on technology because it was making human workers obsolete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We take the new technologies for granted, but it may take centuries to evaluate their impact on social relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what of those who choose to drop out in the meantime?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Richard Kovac, Stevens Point</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was aggressor during deadly encounter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's sad that there was no law the jury could use in the George Zimmerman trial to address the aggressiveness he displayed by getting out of his vehicle to follow Trayvon Martin when he was advised not to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman stalked Martin, took his life and tried to justify it by claiming self defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When someone is tracking you down, you've got one of two options: flight or fight. Apparently Martin's first choice was flight. Otherwise Zimmerman wouldn't have had to hunt him down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I'm being chased by another person and we get into an altercation, how am I the aggressor? The inconsistency of Zimmerman's stories implies that he may have been fabricating, and that he was the aggressor when confronting Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was just trying to protect himself from a pursuing stranger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Jeffrey L. Brooks, Madison</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Badgers recruiting too many quarterbacks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is recruiting for Badger football being run right or wrong? You decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in bringing on board all these quarterbacks, the coaches must not realize there are other starting positions on offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't the recruited quarterbacks coming in understand that only one of them is a starter, and there will be little or no playing time for the rest of them? How can they think they will have playing time in an overstocked position?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wonder what each recruit thinks after the spiel by the coach and the promises made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the rug is basically pulled out from under him when another quarterback - who the coach must think is more qualified - is recruited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone likes a winner, but not at these personnel costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Don Schoechert, Montello</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secure land for Madison bypass highway now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hurrah for your recent editorial, &quot;Beltline bypass needs serious look.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a former Wisconsin Department of Transportation engineer for highways, I have long supported planning for such a new highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The existing Beltline needs upgrading, as is now being planned. However, the need for improved highway capacity does not end there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new outer highway from south of Verona, through the southern rural portion of Fitchburg, to a junction with the interstate highway east of McFarland would allow traffic the means to bypass the metropolitan area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would take a large number of heavy trucks, as well as other traffic with no Madison destination, off the existing Beltline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is already a need for this outer highway, but it is not realistic to expect it to be constructed for several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then why be concerned now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take a good look at the development and growth in Fitchburg over the last few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Planning should be going on now to identify the location and land needed for the right of way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That way the corridor can be reserved before all the rural area is consumed by development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Dave Strand, Fitchburg</SPAN></P>
