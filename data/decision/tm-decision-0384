<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt's crisis is the result of an outdated election system, which is even worse than our own local elections were before Berkeley, Oakland, San Leandro and San Francisco passed reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt's problems can also be solved with the same improvements: District representation and Instant Runoff (Ranked Choice) Voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;parliament&quot; proportional election system itself motivates voters to vote along sectarian lines so that their ethnic/religious group will be represented. Only with district representation and ranked voting are politicians motivated to overcome sectarian divisions and promise to focus on improving their district's future instead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win, they cannot risk alienating any ethnic group because they will need all the second- and third-choice votes they can get. This is why Oakland and San Francisco now have the first big-city Asian mayors in the United States, along with nondivisive, policy-oriented political climates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should be sharing these benefits and helping Egypt get proper voting equipment before new elections are held. This is the ideal opportunity, while Egypt has no incumbent government to resist/prevent modernization.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real progress in recycling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News that California's per-capita creation of wastes has decreased from 4.4 pounds per person per day to 4.3 pounds (June 30) in the last year masks that the population has increased by 300,000 people, so the volume of wasted materials may stay about the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State staff erroneously (in my opinion) switched to a per-capita system of measurement about six years ago that fails to show serious progress in waste reduction during a depressed economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more interesting is the behavior of some businesses and families that make ounces of waste a day through careful purchasing and careful management of their used materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight of the 10 largest cities in California have established zero waste goals, but the numbers don't show much progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arthur R. Boone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berkeley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boone is the owner of Center for Recycling Research in Berkeley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Engineering colleges at UC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shankar Sastry, dean of the College of Engineering at UC Berkeley, announced his frustration at the ineffectiveness of Berkeley at fulfilling incoming students' first choice to be engineers. Bravo Sastry!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UC Berkeley's leaders misapply resources into dated programs while Sastry could instead double the number of engineering graduates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many qualified students and applicants don't even apply because of the intense competition for existing slots. Because of limited funding, it currently takes a 4.4 grade-point average to be admitted into Berkeley's vaunted engineering programs. Only valedictorians need apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sastry could readily admit another 700 students per year just as qualified, doubling the output of amazing talent, if the chancellor would demonstrate executive discipline to reallocate his existing operating budget more wisely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, many disappointed Bears take what they can get, often studying for nonexistent or poorly paying careers, while the promise of a career in engineering that they desire is lost. Meanwhile, Provost George Breslauer advocates increasing tuition -- the total yearly cost to attend approaches $35,000 -- while denying capable students their career of choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's time for wisdom at UC Berkeley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buzz Pedrotti</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART strike mustn't happen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting around the Bay Area when you're disabled is tough enough. Getting around the Bay Area without BART is virtually impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A simple elevator outage at BART can easily make a person in a wheelchair late to a doctor's appointment. Without BART, it means you are probably not going to make the appointment at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those of us with disabilities, BART isn't just a transit service -- it's a lifeline service. Many disabled live on limited incomes and are either incapable or cannot afford to drive. Other options, such as paratransit, are either scarce or too expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART remains the fastest, most efficient, most reliable and most affordable transportation option for most Bay Area residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a member of several local transportation planning agencies and committees, I know how scarce transit dollars are and how hard it will be to invest back into the 40-year-old system and its employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is important that BART management and its unions reach a fair settlement before the coming Aug. 4 deadline and avoid another strike. The disabled community, and the region as a whole, is depending on it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lessons from Florida verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict in the Trayvon Martin case teaches us three things:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't go walking after dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't wear a hoody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't be a person of color. (Even a dark tan is suspicious.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have learned nothing in the last 50 years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no IRS 'scandal'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent forum contributor's letter harped on the Internal Revenue Service &quot;scandal.&quot; He opined, &quot;Targeting a group based on their beliefs has the ring of World War II Germany.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That claim is outrageously inappropriate, and he knows that stooping to such an obscene analogy is far worse than that. Coupling President Obama to Adolph Hitler is inexcusably despicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IRS investigation is ongoing, but premature conclusions have been offered by numerous partisans. What is known thus far is that requests for tax-exempt status by most conservative groups were processed carelessly. The bungled handling is intolerable, but what is known hardly constitutes a scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IRS's long-standing rule granted tax-exempt status only to groups that were &quot;exclusively&quot; engaged in social welfare activity. Years ago, that standard was altered to require that such groups only be &quot;primarily&quot; engaged in such activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the organizations in question aren't even superficially engaged in such charitable activity. The groups exist to prod the Republican Party further right, and they have no legal right to ask taxpayers to subsidize their partisan cause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public unions and strikes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent editorial about costly public pension subsidies, the Times suggested the elected officials who continue to agree to the costly deals should be voted out of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is extremely unlikely to have different results by replacing the elected officials. The reason is that there is little difference between the majority of the voting public and the public unions. As a consequence, the public unions are negotiating with their mirror image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is needed is a ban against public employees striking, or to privatize all public supported works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will this happen? Perhaps when the public unions kill the goose that laid the golden egg, but then it will be much too late.</SPAN></P>
