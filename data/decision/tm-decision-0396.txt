TO THE EDITORS:
Description: What do Tremar Boggs and TrayvonMartin have in common? Young black males between the ages of 15-18. Well, one is being held out as a hero (as he should) and the other was profiled as a thug and criminal. 
The hero sped through the neighborhood watching over a part of a community and possibly saved a life or halted a possible sexual assault. Both were just enjoying their respective communities, but one was shot dead.
If you think these scenarios are different, I say you should think again. Sorry thing about attitudes is that these incidents are interchangeable, and if Tremar was in Trayvon's place, he would be dead, too.
What Tremar did is what community watch is about, looking after the neighborhood and, "reporting" crime, not causing it.
Until communities get on the same page, the death of young black males will continue. Much of this has to do with who molds our judicial system. Take a look around the Lancaster County Courthouse, sheriff and police department's diversity, it's almost laughable.
Go to the courthouse and listen to testimony in court. You may be surprised how much perjury is presented and tolerated in the halls of justice, and by what side.
Even the media does not always give true and full stories of the judicial system in our town, only the so-called juicy parts, and we know who does not benefit from that! If you don't know, please ask somebody.
