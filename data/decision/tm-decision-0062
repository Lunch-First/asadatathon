</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial tensions in the United States are likely to rise if greater efforts are not made to narrow the rich-poor divide and create jobs for hard-pressed ordinary Americans, U.S. President Barack Obama has warned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urging Washington to give up political point-scoring and focus on rebuilding America's sluggish economy, Obama said that years of stagnant wages and depressed incomes had left people &quot;anxious&quot; and &quot;frustrated&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Racial tensions won't get better,&quot; he predicted in an interview with The New York Times. &quot;They may get worse, because people will feel as if they've got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot. If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested.&quot; In recent weeks, America has reexamined the race debate following the acquittal of George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch captain, who shot dead black teenager Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next month also marks the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, when civil rights leader Martin Luther King delivered his &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech - an event that Obama said was not just about race, but about economic opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;... That that was a march for jobs and justice ... there was a massive economic component to that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
