<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 23--NEW HAVEN -- Four African-Americans brought their own experiences and insights into a community conversation on healing and triumphing after the George Zimmerman verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event drew about 275 people, an organizer, Carroll E. Brown of West Haven, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens stood when asked if they felt more vulnerable in the wake of the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking across the audience, the facilitator, the Rev. Dr. Jerry Streets, said, &quot;We have people of different ethnic backgrounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not a white race, we're not a black race, we are a human race,&quot; said Streets, senior pastor of Dixwell Avenue Congregational United Church of Church, where the Monday evening program was held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speakers were Assistant Police Chief Thaddeus Reddish; Onya Harris, president of New Haven Black Social Workers Association; Teddy Brown Sr., retired detective sergeant, West Haven Police Department; and the Rev. Keith A. King, an attorney, prosecutor and senior pastor of Christian Tabernacle Baptist Church, Hamden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each offered some guidance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddish said, &quot;It's not the George Zimmermans that are killing the black males. It's our own black males that are killing black males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our problem is not Zimmerman. Our problem is not 'stand your ground.' Our problem is our youth who have no respect for each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officers in New Haven are part of the community, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddish recalled seeing a man on a bike with a gun in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He &quot;pulled the gun out and put it on my face and pulled the trigger. It was a Glock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gun failed to go off. There was a foot chase; opportunity to shoot the man who tried to kill him. The man went to prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see him now with his little kids walking on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Connecticut law said I could use deadly force, but I didn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddish's family of civil rights workers in the South were &quot;totally against&quot; his being a cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I uphold the laws of the state of Connecticut, and it's up to you to change the laws,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like President Barack Obama, King said he encountered racism early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fifth-grade, I recall having a good friend who happened to be white.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While his friend's mother was not home, they hung out together at the boy's house until one day the boy's brother came home and saw King was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was in shock,&quot; King said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that, he was never allowed back at the friend's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His family told him: '&quot;You were not allowed because they found out you were black.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He offered the following suggestions to African-Americans: get voting up to 80 to 90 percent; increase diversity in every area of law enforcement; and &quot;recommit to the family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very rarely,&quot; King said, did he see a &quot;daddy in the courtroom,&quot; when a young African-American man was being prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris noted, &quot;We need more African-American therapists working with African-American boys,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aim is to &quot;wipe the face of despair off them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of young men are stricken with depression, but we see it as aggression,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also identified women who are victims of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown, the former officer, addressed the Zimmerman trial for shooting Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a sloppy investigation,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look at this trial, who was being tried?&quot; he asked the audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he was trained at the Police Academy, Brown said, shooting targets were black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he got out on the street, he looked at blacks in the same way, &quot;because I was programmed to think like that,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
