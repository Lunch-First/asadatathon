<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayoral candidate Bill Thompson's harsher stance on the NYPD's use of stop-and-frisk is a calculated move to garner support from black and Latino voters, critics charge.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The former city comptroller, who on Sunday likened racial profiling in the Trayvon Martin killing to police profiling of citizens here, had until recently embraced a middle-of-the-road stance on the controversial NYPD tactic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a number of polls have shown Thompson struggling to cement the support of black voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think he originally felt that certain segments of the population were going to go with him automatically. He started looking at polls and seeing that wasn't happening,&quot; said City Councilman Jumaane Williams (D-Brooklyn), the lead sponsor of two bills that are meant to combat the high numbers of stops of black and Latino citizens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thompson has been criticized for not supporting either bill - including one that would create an inspector general to monitor the NYPD.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think Thompson's trying to have it both ways without putting any skin in the game,&quot; added Wil&shy;liams. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of Thompson's opponents in the race for mayor also accused him of flip-flopping on the issue for political gain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Cut the bull, Bill,&quot; said former City Council member and mayoral hopeful Sal Albanese, who called on Thompson to apologize for being overly critical of the city's police force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Since this campaign started, Bill Thompson has made it his business to try to be all things to all people,&quot; he added. &quot;New Yorkers can see right through his pandering.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Throughout the campaign, Thompson has called stop-and- frisk a useful tool but one that has been &quot;abused&quot; and &quot;misused.&quot; He said that, rather than creating legislation to improve the police tactic, all it would take is a change of mayors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Sunday, he said, &quot;If our government profiles people because of skin color and treats them as potential criminals, how can we expect citizens to do any less?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yesterday, Thompson insisted his stance on the issue hasn't changed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;My position on stop-and-frisk still is the same. It is of continual concern about that,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has yet to endorse a candidate in the mayor's race, said the speech made him go from &quot;disappointed&quot; to &quot;encouraged&quot; regarding Thompson's stance on stop-and-frisk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I thought it was clearly something that will probably energize a lot of voters who have questions about the fairness of the criminal justice system and policing,&quot; he told The Post. &quot;I think it could prove to energize a lot of voters in the black and Latino community who have been waiting to see where Mr. Thompson stood.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective union President Mike Palladino, who also heads a coalition of uniformed employees that endorsed Thompson, said his latest comments about stop-and-frisk wouldn't impact their backing. </SPAN></P>
