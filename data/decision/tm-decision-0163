<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A JUROR said in an interview made available on Thursday she feels neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman got away with murder for fatally shooting unarmed teen Trayvon Martin, but that there wasn't enough evidence at trial to convict him under Florida law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman was acquitted earlier this month of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the slaying last year of the unarmed 17-year-old. The Miami teenager was shot and killed during a confrontation with Zimmerman. The case spawned heated national debates about racial profiling and the so-called Stand Your Ground self-defence laws in Florida and other states.<BR>  Juror B29 told ABC News she favoured convicting Zimmerman of second-degree murder when deliberations began by the six-member, all-women jury. &quot;I was the juror that was going to give them a hung jury,&quot; she said. &quot;I fought to the end.&quot; <BR> But by the second day of deliberating, she realised there wasn't enough proof to convict the 29-year-old of a crime. &quot;Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God,&quot; she said. <BR> Zimmerman was seen publicly for the first time last week helping a family whose vehicle flipped on a Florida highway.<BR>  Juror B29, identified only as Maddy, is the second panellist to go public with what went on during case deliberations. Juror B37 said the actions of Zimmerman and Martin both led to the teenager's fatal shooting, but Zimmerman didn't actually break the law. - Sapa-AP<BR>  NOT HAPPY: Juror B29, identified only as Maddy, centre, speaks to ABC News with lawyer David Chico Picture: REUTERS</SPAN></P>
