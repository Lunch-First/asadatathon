THE CITY'S top street basketball players will suspend their annual summer tournament this weekend for a special tribute series to honor TrayvonMartin.
The Entertainers Basketball Classic, which has hosted popular games at Harlem's famed Rucker Park basketball court for 33 years, said the tournament for the slain 17-year-old was fitting. 
"Every kid that plays street ball is a part of the street ball family and they are our Trayvon," said Chris Latimer, an EBC spokesman.
The EBC expects a crowd as large as 3,000. All proceeds will go the TrayvonMartin Foundation.
The killing of Florida teenager at the hands of a white neighborhood watchman sparked a national debate on racial profiling. A jury found Martin's killer George Zimmerman not guilty on July 13. Zimmerman had argued self-defense as the reason he killed the unarmed teen.
Some of the local teams who will take the court are Bingo All-Stars from the Bronx, Skull Gang from Harlem and Queens' Sean Bell All-Stars.
The Queens team is named after the man who was shot at more than 50 times and killed by the NYPD the morning of his wedding day in 2006.
"I just feel like everything needs to stand for something," said Cliff Clinkscalvs, 28, a player on team.
"For Sean Bell, for us as a program, for us being picked as one of the teams in the city," he said. "I think that's a blessing and very special. We'll be very honored to play."
Travyon Martin Invitational Tournament at Rucker Park, 155th Street and Frederick Douglas Blvd. in Harlem, July 26 through July 29, 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. For info, visit EBCRuckerPark.com.
