 GEORGE Zimmerman's non - guilty verdict was expected right from the time a six-member single gender white majority jury was selected to decide the fate of Zimmerman in the murder case of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African-American teenager. 
It was quite abnormal to select a six-member jury consisting of white majority women to decide such a high-profile case which caught the attention of thousands of people around the world.
Apart from this, it was dubious the prosecutor lawyers did not object to this single gender jury in spite of underplaying the racial tone prevalent in the case and suspected racial profiling of the victim.
Not arresting the defendant for 44 days after the incident, as well as sparing him from not taking the stand when he is the only person alive and involved in scuffle and killing the victim, supports the allegation of racial undertone of the case.
The people are right in losing faith in the American judicial system as it does not deliver the requisite justice when it comes to dealing with people of an African-American background. In Town Hall meetings, people have pointed out that the people of African- American background are generally punished 25 per cent more than their white counterparts.
Based on the outcome of Rodney King and Zimmerman cases, one may suspect that a non-racial society is not in existence in the USA and the situation needs to be resolved for public satisfaction by re-opening the case under fundamental civil rights of life.
