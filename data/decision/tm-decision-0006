<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - The mother of slain Florida teenager Trayvon Martin and a prominent black lawyers' organization are keeping up the pressure for repeal of &quot;stand your ground&quot; self-defense laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sybrina Fulton joined the call Monday with top officials of the National Bar Association, which is holding its annual convention in Miami Beach. Fulton says she believes neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman got away with murder when he shot Martin in Sanford last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder earlier this month. He claimed he was acting in self-defense when he shot Martin because the unarmed 17-year-old attacked him. Many critics have said they believe Zimmerman profiled Martin because he was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida lawmakers say it is unlikely the state's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law will be repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal officials are reviewing whether to charge Zimmerman with violating Martin's civil rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gas and electrical utility crews were trying to determine what caused the collapse. Rescue crews were combing through the rubble to see if anyone else was trapped.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kennedy killing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. - Weeks before the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's assassination this fall, ReelzChannel will take another look at the killing in a docudrama that suggests a Secret Service agent fired one of the bullets that felled Kennedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;JFK: The Smoking Gun&quot; is based on the work of retired Australian police Detective Colin McLaren, who spent four years combing through evidence from Kennedy's death on Nov. 22, 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-hour docudrama airs Nov. 3 in the U.S., Canada and Australia. It suggests that agent George Hickey fired one of the bullets that hit Kennedy. Hickey, who is now dead, was riding in the car behind Kennedy's limo that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program is ReelzChannel's second Kennedy-related offering. In 2011, the cable channel aired &quot;The Kennedys&quot; after History Channel dropped the miniseries.</SPAN></P>
