<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, my heart goes out to the family of Treyvon (Trayvon) Martin. I am deeply sorry for their loss.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we all saw, President Obama talked about what happened in Florida, absorbing national attention over what is a local issue. Every day that the press allows him to pull a Bill Clinton and say, &quot;I feel your pain&quot; without a challenge is a day he gets to ignore dealing with the fact that we have 21 million people who are unemployed and eight million people who can only find part-time work. The country is 14 million jobs short of where it should be and has a real unemployment rate of more than 13 percent. Even with the government's cooked books, the youth unemployment rate is 24 percent, and the African-American unemployment rate is more than 13 percent. Every day that the press allows a cynical charade like this to go unchallenged is a day that President Obama doesn't have to face tens of millions of Americans out of work or underemployed, that he has presided over a scandalous $300 billion-a-year trade deficit with China, that businesses are refusing to expand beyond 50 employees and are limiting employees to only working fewer than 30 hours per week because of &quot;Obamacare.&quot; Every day that the press plays along with the farce of treating Treyvon (Trayvon) Martin like some modern Medgar Evers is a day that the worst president economically since Herbert Hoover doesn't have to face the music.
