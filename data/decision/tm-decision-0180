<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father of slain teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is slated to appear at a Sunday evening rally in Riviera Beach, one of a series of high-profile appearances by Tracy Martin since George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting death of his 17-year-old son. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riviera Beach Mayor Thomas Masters organized the 7:30 p.m. &quot;Community Rally for Justice and Peace&quot; at Hilltop Missionary Baptist Church on 30th Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with Masters, several local pastors are co-hosting the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as Tracy Martin and Trayvon's mother, Sybrina Fulton, crisscross the country urging the rollback of so-called &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Fulton spoke before the National Urban League in Philadelphia, urging the gathering: &quot;Please use my story, please use my tragedy, please use my broken heart to say to yourself, 'We cannot let this happen to anybody else's child.'~HOA~128~128~&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida law, she said, &quot;prevented the person who shot and killed my son to be held accountable and to pay for his awful crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal ignited debate over &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws, which in Florida says a person has no duty to retreat and can &quot;meet force with force&quot; -- including deadly force -- if the person believes he or she is facing the threat of death or serious injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman did not use the law as part of his defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it was referenced in jury instructions, and one juror has since expressed regret that it helped pave the way for a verdict of not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tallahassee, where Gov. Rick Scott has said he will not budge from his support of the law, there is growing support for revisiting &quot;stand your ground&quot; -- most recently from one of Scott's challengers for the governorship next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nan Rich, a Democratic state lawmaker who in 2005 joined a unanimous Florida Senate in passing the legislation, recently wrote in campaign literature that &quot;stand your ground&quot; is &quot;broken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, pressure for change continues to gather steam: Protesters who have set up camp outside Scott's office are entering their third week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on Monday morning, both Martin and Fulton will appear with lawyers, including family attorney Ben Crump, and civil rights leaders in Miami at a National Bar Association news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The topic is inequalities in the justice system.</SPAN></P>
