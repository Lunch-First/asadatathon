<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We still have stubbornly high unemployment in North Carolina and in the United States as a whole. Yet Congress is not loosening the purse strings to fund sorely needed maintenance of our infrastructure such as roads, bridges and schools. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funding infra-structure projects will put people back to work and rebuild our state and our country. I assume the concern in Congress is the huge yearly budget deficits. Yet we readily are appropriating over $1 trillion each year for our military to fight another war overseas and to build another multi-billion-dollar weapons system. U.S. Senators Richard Burr and Kay Hagan and U.S. Rep. David Price better start spending money in North Carolina and not keep sending billions overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress and President Obama need to take care of America and Americans first.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's suspicious look like?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I resent the comment Paul Richardson made about Trayvon Martin being a prowler. Never ever, nowhere was it ever mentioned that Martin was prowling around on the night that he was murdered. I or no one else saw it written in The Herald-Sun articles, or said in the media. The word prowler was never used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young man was simply on his way home to his father's house in the gated community after coming from the store with a pack of Skittles with his hoodie on because it had started to rain. That's what hoods are for; to protect your head from the falling rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And another thing ? the trial was not about marijuana or jewelry. It was about a young man being followed simply because in the eyes of a paranoid fool, he looked suspicious. What exactly does suspicious look like? I would like to know because, I am a beautiful, attractive woman and I have stared other beautiful women up and down only because I was admiring something about them. Maybe their outfit, their beautiful hairstyle, skin tone. Does that make me suspicious that I am going to rob or kidnap them or something? If you don't touch anybody or anything or get too close, how in the world can you be a threat?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Check your facts next time you make a comment about something you haven't been following in the news.</SPAN></P>
