<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GEORGE ZIMMERMAN &quot;got away with murder&quot; in the killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, according to one of the six female jurors who acquitted him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only ethnic minority member of the jury told ABC News that she &quot;owes an apology to&quot; the 17-year-old's parents as she felt that she &quot;let them down&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The black Hispanic woman, 36, who has eight children, said she believed Mr Zimmerman, who is white Hispanic, was guilty of the second-degree murder charge. &quot;I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury. I fought to the end,&quot; she said. But others finally persuaded her there was not the evidence under Florida law to convict Mr Zimmerman, whose lawyers claimed he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,&quot; said the woman, identified as Maddy. &quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God.&quot; Her comments prompted fresh controversy over a verdict that led to nationwide protests and debate about racial profiling and self-defence laws.</SPAN></P>
