Editor:
Please avoid bias in reporting in the George Zimmerman/ Trayvon Martin case by showing current pictures of both. The pictures selected by your newspaper, and the media in general, are a current, stern-looking picture of Zimmerman next to an old picture of a cute, smiling, cherub-like Martin.
As you know, this will invoke feelings like "how could anyone have an altercation with such a teddy bear?"
This appears to be an attempt to bias the news rather than just report it.
