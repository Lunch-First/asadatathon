India, July 28 -- Jay Z admitted that racism still exists in America while defending TrayvonMartin's right to 'stand his ground' with violent retaliation against unprofessional profiling.
The hip-hop icon endorsed Martin's battery of George Zimmerman as legitimate self-defense against racial profiling and surveillance by the neighborhood watch volunteer.
The entertainment mogul told Rap Radar that Zimmerman may have won, but that doesn't mean Trayvon was a criminal.
He also ridiculed and rejected the right to use a firearm to defend against a home invasion/robbery, the Washington Times reported.
Angry over the acquittal of Zimmerman on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of the 17-year-old Trayvon, the rapper said that Zimmerman's surveillance of Trayvon was a form of predatory pursuit, which licensed a violent counterattack by the targeted teen.
