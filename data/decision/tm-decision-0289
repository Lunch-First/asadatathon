<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-We shouldn't assume that people want to do away with jury trials or overturn their verdicts just because race is being discussed. We need to be able to see things from other perspectives, and I think President Obama's speech on race was an effort to promote that understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Would the person or persons who keep stealing our neighborhood crime watch signs please return them! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The Zimmerman case begs the question: How do we keep guns out of the hands of fools? The root cause of the death of the Martin kid was a fool like Zimmerman had a gun. Is it possible to keep fools from having guns? Or would that be disarming half of America?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Robin Davis thinks the old guard has let the Democratic Party down? That's a laugh. Robin Davis is the old guard of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-What qualifies out-of-state Gayle Manchin to be the head of our state's board if education? Her ability to lead a witch-hunt to get rid of impressive, qualified Jorea Marple to be replaced by good old boy Phares? Her ability to jump into any photo op available?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Director Frank Jezioro makes it plain that the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources is for sale to the highest bidder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The Sanford, Fla. &quot;special&quot; prosecutors repeated several times, &quot;Zimmerman wanted to be a cop!&quot; Since when is &quot;wanting to be a cop&quot; a bad thing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The police chief and prosecutor who lost their jobs, and the jurors who put their lives on hold rather than see an innocent man persecuted deserve Gazette smiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Everyone complaining about Morissey probably voted for him. All he is doing is acting on his Republican values. That is why I voted for McGraw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Three more women murdered in Cleveland, Ohio. Maybe the Republican Party could vote 39 times to protect women in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I think that was out of character for President Obama to come on television and talk about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. I agree that Trayvon did get a raw deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I just heard on the news there's been over 200 killed in Chicago since the year started and most of them are black. I wonder why Mr. Al Sharpton isn't out there protesting and I wonder why the president won't go home and help his town out?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-If MADD mothers would have their way, the drunk drivers would never see the light of day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I see nothing wrong with the stand your ground law myself. If somebody tries to invade your property or maybe tries to beat your head against a rock or concrete, what are you supposed to do? Lie there and let them do it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-There's a segment in this country that can't stand it because we don't do royalty like England. The Kennedys pose like royalty to some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-It was never mentioned in trial that George Zimmerman racially profiled and chased Trayvon&nbsp;Martin with the intent to hold him until police arrived so he could falsely accuse him of being one of the people involved in recent neighborhood break-ins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges. I think he should be granted immunity from any other charges that may arise from this, including lawsuits and investigations and everything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-What has happened to Nitro? Dunbar used to be the drug and alcohol valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-In the past 12 years we have spent $93 billion to rebuild Afghanistan. Can we take a few billion and rebuild Detroit?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-We used to be a great country that took care of ourselves. Now the government is feeding 15 percent of the people on welfare, food stamps. Isn't it a great country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I was just wondering why they cut all the trees down on the east side of Albans school in St. Albans? They were so nice and shady and now it looks terrible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-This tea party bunch is going to ruin our democracy. They don't like President Obama and will not agree on anything that is brought to the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-To the person who picks the comments to put in the paper: I know you know my voice by now. Because I don't agree with your liberal views, you never print anything I say anymore. I used to have my comments published regularly. So I submit to you that you're not a fair journalist.</SPAN></P>
