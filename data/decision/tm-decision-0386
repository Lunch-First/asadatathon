<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I compliment the Free Press Journal for the bold questions put to US Vice President Joe Biden. The US supports its surveillance on the internet, encompassing the entire globe, on the premise that it helps in fighting/stopping terrorism. But what about the US government supporting terrorist organisations like the Taliban earlier in Afghanistan, to throw out the then Soviet Union from that country? Can all ordinary Americans or other citizens of the world can be considered terrorists to snoop on , but not the government? Why there should be secret courts for surveillance programme,when other courts in the US are transparent in working, compared to other nations, and they also have a code of conduct for judges and judicial employees in the public domain, which is a rare commodity for many nations' courts' websites. There should have been one more question - how about prosecuting the ex-President of US ,for war crimes in Iraq, when the US itself said that Iraq did not possess nuclear weapons, but it attacked that country on those very same grounds? What about President Obama's mere paid lip service in the Trayvon Martin case? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another question should have been : Will the Navy Seal commandos hunt down the whistleblower Snowden, who is in Russia now and bring him back to the US? Will the US fighter jets intercept the aircraft carrying Snowden to Latin American countries like Venezuela and Cuba, which have offered him asylum?<BR><BR>Deendayal M Lulla</SPAN></P>
