<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) A U.S. firearms group has raised more than $12,000 to be spent on guns or a security system for George Zimmerman, the former neighborhood watch volunteer who was acquitted in the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Buckeye Firearms Foundation believes Zimmerman&quot;s gun rights are being violated by the U.S. Department of Justice. The department has taken all the evidence from the trial, including the gun that killed Martin, as part of a civil rights investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal sparked nationwide protests and calls for federal officials to charge Zimmerman with violating Martin&quot;s civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was acquitted earlier this month of second-degree murder in the 2012 shooting of Martin in a gated community in Florida. Zimmerman, 29, told police he shot Martin, 17, after the teenager physically attacked him; Martin&quot;s family and supporters say Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, racially profiled Martin as a potential criminal and wrongly followed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s brother and one of his attorneys have said he receives threats and is concerned about his safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foundation&quot;s donation for Zimmerman is meant to be spent on guns, ammunition, protective gear or a security system, said Ken Hanson, the group&quot;s legal chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Justice refused to return him his gun, and he&quot;s in need of protection,&quot; Hanson said. &quot;The money is intended to be used for anything he needs to defend himself or his family. He has complete discretion on how to use the money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money could end up being used to pay for Zimmerman&quot;s defense costs and fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s spokesman, Shawn Vincent, said Zimmerman has been offered free guns, but such donations haven&quot;t been accepted.</SPAN></P>
