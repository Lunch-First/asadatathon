<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happens when following the letter of the law still leads  to an unjust outcome? What is the remedy? What, besides  expressing deep outrage, are ordinary citizens to do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of George Zimmerman of murder and manslaughter  charges in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin left many Americans holding  two thoughts that at first seem contradictory. On the one hand, considering  Florida's permissive laws on self-defense and gun use, topped  by the prosecution's flawed performance, the jury probably came to a  reasonable conclusion. And yet, an innocent young man is dead and  the person who pulled the trigger should somehow be held responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these thoughts aren't necessarily contradictory. A verdict in  a criminal trial  especially one bound up with race and wound up  by a voracious, non-stop media machine  does not necessarily render  moral judgment and create a kind of civic accountability. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a way, we rely on the legal system too much to give us a definitive  judgment of events, Perry Dane, a professor at Rutgers School of  Law, told the Forward. As citizens, we are still entitled to say something  unjust happened, that [Zimmerman] did something unjust beyond  the reach of criminal law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A legal decision is determined by a specialized form of evaluation  and an intentionally difficult standard when the outcome could  be a person's loss of freedom or loss of life. Implicit in that high bar  is the awareness that a defendant might actually be guilty even if he  or she is legally exonerated. Most of the public certainly came to that  conclusion in 1995, when, according to a Gallup-CNN/USA Today  poll, only 33% agreed with the acquittal of O. J. Simpson in an even  more circus-like murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We won't be surprised if polling after the Zimmerman verdict  shows the same pattern. One can acknowledge the legal limitations  of determining guilt while still believing that the fact that an unarmed  young man was shot dead by an armed civilian who ignored entreaties  to stay in his car ought to leave every American outraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the remedy? What should citizens do to correct this  injustice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One avenue is certainly legislative. Florida's Stand Your Ground  law was barely mentioned at Zimmerman's trial, but it framed the  context and the outcome. Under the law, a version of which exists  in more than 20 states, people fearing for their lives can use deadly  force even if the possibility existed of retreating from a confrontation.  Eliminating the duty to retreat radically redefines the legal concept  of self-defense, which has until now considered deadly force as the  absolute last resort outside the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida was the first state to enact Stand Your Ground, in 2005,  and from the beginning, law enforcement officials have been among  its staunchest critics. Miami's chief of police said it was unnecessary  and dangerous. The head of the association representing prosecuting  attorneys has called for its repeal. For good reason: A study commission  by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that in states  with Stand Your Ground laws, the number of homicides had significantly  increased from the years before the law was enacted. As many  feared, the law encourages the use of deadly force when there is, in  fact, either no danger or less dangerous alternatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now researchers are picking up another disturbing trend:  racial disparities. A study by the Urban Institute's Justice Policy Center  commissioned by PBS's Frontline using FBI data found that whites  who kill blacks in Stand Your Ground states are far more likely to be  found justified in their killings than are blacks who kill, regardless of  the race of their victims. The data doesn't yet prove bias, because the  circumstances of these one-on-one killings isn't analyzed, but it certainly  hints at it. Fortunately, the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights is  launching a broader, more detailed investigation of those concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The important thing to remember here is that Stand Your Ground  laws aren't the result of grassroots activism sparked by an expanded  desire for citizen self-defense. They are a national product pushed  by allies of the gun lobby. And they have been approved by so many  state legislatures because that lobby has figured out how to wield enormous  power in Tallahassee and Austin and Harrisburg and Helena  while no one else cared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So ordinary citizens have to try much harder to outflank this  growing power. It's not sexy stuff. Anyone who has spent time in a  state capitol knows that. But it's no coincidence that on this issue, and  countless others, the lack of scrutiny  exacerbated, we might add, by  the unconscionable decision by too many news outlets to scale back  their coverage of state lawmakers  has allowed clever, well-funded  national lobbies to shape, if not dictate, consequential laws. And the  embarrassingly low turnout in elections for state legislatures allows  that power to grow unchecked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be difficult emotionally to draw a direct line between the occasional  campaign for a State House seat and the understandable pain,  fear and anger felt by so many Americans, especially those who look  like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, after this verdict. Repealing a handful of dangerous  laws is hardly the only way to address the deep-seated racial bias  that still exists on America's streets, in its courtrooms and its halls of  power. But it's a start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America has had other unjust laws that were erased by the brave  work of those who knew this nation had the capacity to live up to  higher moral standards. Sadly, that work must continue.</SPAN></P>
