Racial tensions in the United States are likely to rise if greater efforts are not made to narrow the rich-poor divide and create jobs for hard-pressed ordinary Americans, U.S. President Barack Obama has warned. 
Urging Washington to give up political point-scoring and focus on rebuilding America's sluggish economy, Obama said that years of stagnant wages and depressed incomes had left people "anxious" and "frustrated".
"Racial tensions won't get better," he predicted in an interview with The New York Times. "They may get worse, because people will feel as if they've got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot. If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested." In recent weeks, America has reexamined the race debate following the acquittal of George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch captain, who shot dead black teenager Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla.
Next month also marks the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, when civil rights leader Martin Luther King delivered his "I have a dream" speech - an event that Obama said was not just about race, but about economic opportunity.
"... That that was a march for jobs and justice ... there was a massive economic component to that," he said.
