GEORGE ZIMMERMAN "got away with murder" in the killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, according to one of the six female jurors who acquitted him. 
 The only ethnic minority member of the jury told ABC News that she "owes an apology to" the 17-year-old's parents as she felt that she "let them down".
 The black Hispanic woman, 36, who has eight children, said she believed Mr Zimmerman, who is white Hispanic, was guilty of the second-degree murder charge. "I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury. I fought to the end," she said. But others finally persuaded her there was not the evidence under Florida law to convict Mr Zimmerman, whose lawyers claimed he acted in self-defence.
 "You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty," said the woman, identified as Maddy. "George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God." Her comments prompted fresh controversy over a verdict that led to nationwide protests and debate about racial profiling and self-defence laws.
