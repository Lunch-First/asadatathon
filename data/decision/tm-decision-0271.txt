CONSPIRACY theories are thriving after George Zimmerman reportedly rescued a family from a car wreck days after his acquittal in Trayvon Martin's murder.
Some online sleuths claim the first officer to respond to the crash had posted pro-Zimmerman
items on Facebook before his acquittal.
Others say the accident was staged or may not have happened, since the ``uninjured'' family have gone to ground.
Today, the second trial juror to speak publicly, ``Maddy'', said she thought Zimmerman ``got away with murder''.
