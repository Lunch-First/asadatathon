Tuesday's question 
There's growing opposition to so-called "stand your ground" laws following the George Zimmerman case involving the shooting death of unarmed Florida teen Trayvon Martin. President Obama says these state and local laws need a closer look. Harrisburg Mayor Linda Thompson says these laws, including Pennsylvania's "Castle Doctrine," inspire vigilantism and protect those who act recklessly with guns.  
Do you think so-called "stand your ground" laws need to be reviewed and revised? 
Yes: 529 (23 percent) 
No: 1,749 (77 percent) 
KQV runs two polls simultaneously, one from Internet users, the other from telephone callers. The nonscientific polls often do not reflect the same results. KQV updates its results from time to time, so the results on its website may vary from these results. 
Wednesday's question 
Stung by Americans' persistent worries about the economy and a Capitol gripped by controversy and gridlock, President Obama is suffering his lowest job approval numbers in nearly two years. A new McClatchy-Marist poll finds Obama's job approval at 41 percent, a sharp drop from April's 50 percent and his worst since a 39 percent rating in September 2011. 
Do you approve of the job Obama is doing in office? 
Yes: Call 412-333-9190 
No: Call 412-333-9192 
The final results can be heard on KQV-AM (1410) at 6:58 p.m.
