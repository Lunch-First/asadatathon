<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black Americans are angry about the Zimmerman verdict as most have known such racism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If nothing else, the first black president should be good for explaining to white America exactly what it is that makes black folks tick. In a speech many of us had been waiting for, Barack Obama explained why so many people, especially black Americans, are devastated and angry about the not guilty verdict in the George Zimmerman trial. He delivered a long overdue wake-up call: racism is still a problem. As he told it, as black folks, we see the racism in Zimmerman's actions because most of us - including himself - have experienced that racism. We do not believe justice was served in this case because American justice has existed to put black America in its place. We are not angry because we are out of control, but because racism is a tiring, pervasive, helpless type of pain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Obama's &quot;trust me, it happens&quot; depictions of racism will bring a few heads out of the post-racial sands in which they've been buried. Maybe it takes the president to convince racism-deniers that people still see (and act on) colour, and that most black folks are not bent on &quot;playing the race card&quot;. So, if someone racially profiled Obama, then it must really be happening and it must be wrong. But Obama shied away from the root: race is only a problem if one race is presumed to be vastly better. I don't mind - and in fact hope - that you see my colour, as long as you don't think I'm a problem because of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our president dismissed a national conversation on race, and rightfully so. America doesn't need it. America needs a conversation on white supremacy and how the stereotypes, fear and privilege that grow from it poison the thinking of every American. As we've inched closer to equality, many Americans have come to believe white supremacy only takes the hooded, cross-burning form. However, it is white supremacy that has almost every culture stereotyping its darker members as criminal. Meanwhile, the white race enjoys the privilege of not having to think much about such things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fervently locked car doors and clutched purses Obama admitted to facing lead to hurt feelings, but a black body in the wrong place at the wrong time leads to a suspicious presence that, in the case of Trayvon Martin, can mean death without justice. The very idea that a grown man could fear a lanky teen because black people are frightening, an idea the Zimmerman jury believed, is deeply ingrained in the American psyche. The clutched purse, Zimmerman's itchy trigger finger, and the portrait of Martin as anything but a helpless child have white supremacy to thank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama might have known that talk of white supremacy would bring out the conservative watchdogs and turn off the average American. This is unfortunate, because everyday white people, who listen to hip-hop or watch Oprah and consider themselves enlightened, can then decide they aren't part of the problem. They examine their own &quot;bias&quot;, and because they feel guilty when they occasionally stereotype people, quickly find none. They recoil at the outward racism of their backward relatives and feel good because they are on the not-racist side of white America. But they also don't feel anti-racism is their fight, and can you blame them? To take it on as such would mean relinquishing their ever-present white privilege and replacing it in part with the sting of black pain. So in this zero sum game, change comes slowly, if at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until we recognise, openly, the system upholds the right to defend property with guns over the right of the average citizen, especially suspicious dark ones, to simply exist, there can be no progress. We can only solve our &quot;race problem&quot; when the white supremacist beliefs are acknowledged by Americans of all colours, so that we we can begin to eliminate those beliefs. Until then, the effects of racism will persist, unchecked.</SPAN></P>
