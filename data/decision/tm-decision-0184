<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Al Gore</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> didn't exactly succeed with Current TV. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Oprah</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has pulled it off, so far, with OWN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is making that giant leap - founding a new cable TV channel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Combs on Friday said he plans to launch Revolt by late October. It'll be purely about popular music, of all genres. You know, the way MTV used to be before it dived into the (germ-infested) reality TV pool. Not that Combs faults MTV's business plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If I was in that position, I probably would have bit at that apple, too, to be more than just a music channel and be more of a youth culture network,&quot; Combs, 43, said in Los Angeles, according to USA Today. &quot;But sometimes it's better to do one thing great. The most powerful thing that brings us together is music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Revolt, to be available initially in 25 million homes, has a difficult, if not impossible, goal: rejuvenate TV as a medium by bringing the Internet-obsessed millennial generation to the box. &quot;My mission is to bring kids back to television&quot; with live, &quot;unpredictable&quot; music news, performances, and videos, Combs said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Calling the project ambitious would be an understatement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How much cash is Combs sinking into Revolt?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's a lot of money,&quot; he said, refusing to elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Z on Zimmerman </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">George Zimmerman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Trayvon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Martin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> enraged </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Jay Z</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Didn't Trayvon have the right to stand his ground?&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Beyonc&eacute;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s husband asked. &quot;He was being chased . . . and fought back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jay Z said Zimmerman had no right to act the policeman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This guy's not a professional. . . . This guy's a novice. This guy's a . . . mall cop.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatorship for Bynes? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Amanda Bynes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a danger to herself and others, her parents, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rick</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 68, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Lynn</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 66, argued in an Oxnard, Calif., court on Friday. The Byneses seek an emergency conservatorship order that will give them legal and financial control over the troubled actress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Judge </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Glen Reiser</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> postponed making a ruling, saying he first needs to speak directly with Amanda. Reiser told the Byneses that Amanda is not in any immediate danger, since she's still in a locked psychiatric ward. Her psychiatric hold has been extended to 14 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Byneses will return to court Aug. 9.</SPAN></P>
