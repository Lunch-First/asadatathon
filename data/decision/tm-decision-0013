<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLICE in Washington, DC are investigating a weekend robbery as a possible hate crime in retaliation to the not-guilty verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Bethesda, Maryland man was beaten and robbed early on Saturday by three black men who approached him as he was walking in Washington, DC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are investigating the robbery as a hate crime since one of the men yelled, ``this is for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin'' before attacking the man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men threw the victim to the ground and kicked him before leaving with his wallet and iPhone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim suffered minor injuries and declined medical attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack comes two weeks after a jury found George Zimmerman not-guilty of murdering 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in February 2012, even though he admitted to shooting the teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the l verdict was handed down, Martin's family and supporters called for non-violence. ``It's all right to be vocal, but we don't want to be violent,'' Reverend Walter T. Richardson said. ``We've already lost one soul and we don't want to lose any more.''</SPAN></P>
