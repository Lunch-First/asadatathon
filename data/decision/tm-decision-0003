<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor of THE EAGLE:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama recently gave an impassioned speech in response to the verdict of not guilty in the trial of racial profiler and likely murderer George Zimmerman. The president asserted that in his past, he was Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, profiled and misunderstood by the dominant white culture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, on the other hand, it would be difficult to see the president as anything like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, and, in fact, his behavior in office suggests he likely relates better to George Zimmerman these days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Zimmerman and Obama profile with lethal consequences, Zimmerman in his killing of Martin in an attempt to be a neighborhood watchman, and Obama in the child murder he perpetuates with his use of drone warfare overseas. Both see their victims as unfortunate but necessary collateral damage to keep their communities safe, both men invoke their personal and our national fear of the &quot;other&quot; to legitimatize their criminal and murderous activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it is George Zimmerman waddling swiftly at the heels of a teenager he mistrusts due to his skin color or Obama signing off on artificial intelligence war machines slaughtering innocents abroad, the result is the same. Both men are allowing their prejudice and cowardice to define their actions which have fatal consequences to innocent children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama may have been Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, but he is George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
