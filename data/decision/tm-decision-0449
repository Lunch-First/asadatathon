<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Trayvon saw Zimmerman doing his job as a neighborhood watch person, Trayvon should have approached Zimmerman and identified himself and the purpose of his visit to the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Trayvon Martin had not assaulted Zimmerman: sucker punched him and knocked him to the ground where he proceeded to smash Zimmerman's head into the concrete and forcing Zimmerman to unholster and use his gun in self-defense, maybe Trayvon Martin would still be alive. At least that's what the jury heard in the trial.</SPAN></P>
