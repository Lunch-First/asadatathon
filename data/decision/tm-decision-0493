<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 23--Hello, Tuesday...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weather: It just won't stop. The rain continues again today, with a 50 percent chance of thunderstorms and a high near 86. Tonight's low will fall to the lower 70s with a 40 percent chance of storms. Wednesday will be a copy of today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At long last -- pavement. The residents of Liberty Crossing subdivision in Kimberly finally got their streets paved, ending a long-running dispute with residents and the Kimberly City Council on one side and developer Clint Singletary on the other. The city had imposed an end-of-summer deadline on Singletary before it cashed in the performance bond on the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a boy, and a future king. Prince William and wife Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, are now the parents of a bouncing baby boy weighing 8 pounds, 6 ounces. The baby was born Monday at 4:24 p.m. local time (10:24 a.m. our time). No name has been announced yet for the boy, who will be third in line for the British throne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman is back. But this time, the Florida man is credited with helping save a family of four trapped in an SUV that had rolled over on Interstate 4 near Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman, who was acquitted days ago of second-degree murder charges in the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, had been in hiding since the verdict was handed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports: Braun gone. Major League Baseball has suspended Milwaukee's Ryan Braun for the rest of the season, for what was called &quot;violations of the Basic Agreement and its Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program.&quot; Braun was implicated in using performance-enhancing drugs associated with the company Biogenesis, which has ties to several other MLB players who are expected to face long suspensions over the next few days. Among them: New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez... Meanwhile, Jason Heyward was the star for the Braves, as his laid-out diving catch in center field with two outs in the bottom of the ninth clinched the 2-1 win over the Mets. Atlanta scored twice in the top of the ninth for the comeback win.</SPAN></P>
