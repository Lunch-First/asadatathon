Jay Z, Madonna and Justin Timberlake are not joining Stevie Wonder in protest of Florida's controversial Stand Your Ground law, despite contrary reports. 
Stevie Wonder announced his decision to protest the state's controversial Stand Your Ground Law by taking the unique stance earlier this month.
The legislation is blamed by critics for causing upset in the acquittal of accused murderer George Zimmerman.
The 29-year-old was recently cleared of all charges in the shooting death of an unarmed teenager, Trayvon Martin, whom Zimmerman gunned down on the teen's walk home in Sanford, Florida last year.
Recent reports suggested Jay, Madonna, Justin, as well as Kanye West, The Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart, Usher and Rihanna, had joined Stevie in the fight by refusing to play in the state until the law is abolished.
The list of stars supporting the Superstition hitmaker was initially published by the American Urban Radio Networks.
However, representatives for the aforementioned trio insist the reports are baseless.
"I don't know where this list came from," one representative told Variety.
Stevie announced his efforts while performing in Quebec City last week.
"I decided today that until the Stand Your Ground law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again," he proclaimed.
"As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world."
A spokesperson for the hitmaker has yet to offer further comment on the boycott.
