<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Former city Comptroller William Thompson's little-engine-that-could mayoral campaign took a turn for the truly ugly over the weekend, when the candidate stood up in a predominately black church in Brooklyn and grossly slandered the NYPD. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Seeking to turn a profit from the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin-George Zimmerman tragedy, Thompson laid it on as thick as it comes:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Here in New York City, we have institutionalized Mr. Zimmerman's suspicion with a policy that all but requires our police officers to [profile] young black and Latino men . . . as Trayvon was profiled,&quot; he said - leaving hanging in the air the logical concluding clause: And then murdered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thompson is so wrong on so many different levels that it's difficult to know where to begin, but here are two questions: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l Will Thompson ever again be able to look Police Commissioner Ray Kelly in the eye? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l Why in the world would he say such a thing? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first question is personal; it's a test of character for Thompson. But the answer to No. 2 is as clear as a mountain spring. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Politics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yesterday's Quinnipiac University mayoral poll is the second in a row to show Thompson, who is African-American, well positioned to win a Democratic primary-election runoff in October. But first he must get in the runoff, and the polls also show him lagging badly among black voters (to the benefit, oddly enough, of cyber-flasher Anthony Weiner). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So, what to do? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Well, wave the bloody shirt, of course. That is, recast a tragedy as a martyrdom, regardless of the damage that will do to the truth, to social harmony in New York and to Thompson's ability to govern should he in fact become mayor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thompson apparently feels the need to get beyond his earlier measured support for a muscular NYPD anti-crime presence in high-crime police precincts - a presence that has prompted the hopelessly politicized attack on cops' use of &quot;stop, question and frisk&quot; tactics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, Thompson even had pushed back against the standard left-wing demand for an independent inspector general for the NYPD and similar initiatives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No doubt this was largely coalition-building - middle-class voters strongly support stop-and-frisk, for example - but there also was a detectable measure of sincerity in his rationale: &quot;I'm the one who has to worry about my son being stopped and frisked,&quot; he said. &quot;But I'm worried also about my son being shot by someone who's a member of a gang in the street.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And worry he should, given the statistics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But black voters - Thompson's natural base - strongly oppose the program, and the always-odious Al Sharpton seems to have conditioned his own support for Thompson on unequivocal opposition to it: &quot;This is not a marginal issue,&quot; threatens The Rev. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thus the shameful Kelly-as-Zimmerman analogy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But, while dramatic, it's probably not enough to please Sharpton. His continuing influence depends largely on his ability to keep supplicants dancing in public - so doubtless he's planning further humiliations for Thompson's immediate future. Just to make clear who's boss. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What adjustments will then be required of the candidate's carefully crafted campaign isn't clear. But in a race as close as this one - yesterday's Q-poll shows a statistical three-way dead heat, with Weiner a pile of smoldering wreckage - even subtle shifts could be critical. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thompson has been chugging along in characteristically low-key fashion for some months now - quietly constructing alliances based on decades of personal connections and political give and take.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How much give, and how much take, remains to be seen; one shudders to think of what went in to Thompson's endorsement by the always-grasping teachers union, for example. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet, for better or for worse, that's how we govern ourselves. And Thompson's opponents appear prepared to turn the entire city over to the grabbers; better that half a loaf be stolen than the entire breadbasket, right? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Up to a point. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To play retail politics with people's lives - and that's precisely what Thompson did Sunday - should be impermissible.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To so cynically delegitimize the world's finest urban police department - to cast 35,000 cops as reckless racial-profilers capable of murderous violence - is a grave offense to the NYPD.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And, more important, to the citizens of New York. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Remember Crown Heights? It was a long time ago, but the same issue - contempt for public order - was in play then as it is now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Does Bill Thompson understand that's where he's headed? Does he even care? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Time for some deep soul-searching. </SPAN></P>
