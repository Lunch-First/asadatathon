<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turn on the TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week the &quot;big news&quot; is the birth of a British royal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Drudge ran the birth of the Prince of Cambridge at the top of his page, treating it like it was the biggest event out of Europe since D-Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the media wanted to change the subject to something pleasant -- or completely unimportant -- but the arrival of Kate and William's baby boy was a timely blessing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It blew George Zimmerman, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and the issue of race in America off the front pages. It even eclipsed President Obama's teleprompter-free speech about the Zimmerman verdict last Friday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liberal media, as usual, gave the presidential sermon a standing ovation, saying that Obama -- who claimed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been him 35 years ago -- hit a home run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I agree with what that old boo-bird Bill O'Reilly said on his TV show Monday night. The president didn't whiff completely, but he grounded out weakly to second base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Reilly, madder than usual, praised the president in his &quot;Talking Points Memo&quot; for bringing up the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then he blasted Obama and other black leaders for still having &quot;no clue&quot; how to solve the social and moral problems that continue to rip apart black communities in our cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They won't dare mention the issues of drug gangs, out-of-wedlock births, fatherless families and welfare dependency, O'Reilly railed, &quot;because race hustlers and the grievance industry have intimidated the so-called 'conversation,' turning any valid criticism of African-American culture into charges of racial bias.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Reilly pointed out that, yes, Martin was profiled by Zimmerman, the community watchman. But it wasn't because of his race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was because Martin was wearing a hoodie -- the official national uniform of urban street thugs and drug gangs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President Obama said Martin could have been him 35 years ago, he was talking nonsense. Thirty-five years ago, Barack Obama wasn't stalking around gated communities at night wearing gangster clothes and getting in fistfights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death was a horrible tragedy. That cannot be said too many times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Martin's death should not be exploited any further by the president or anyone else as proof that white racism is the chief cause of problems in the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black communities have been breeding a criminal class for decades. Repealing stand-your-ground laws or passing stricter gun control laws will not change that. Nor will blaming the justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black community's problems begin at home. They are not a result of slavery or discrimination or poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are, as O'Reilly said, a result of the disintegration of the black family, a gangster culture that glorifies criminals, and a bunch of so-called civil rights leaders who ignore reality, preach victimhood and blame racism for everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young black males are dying at disproportionate rates in Chicago and other cities not because they're being shot by racist white cops, or wanna-be cops like George Zimmerman, but because they are being gunned down by other young black males, usually over drug-gang turf wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Reilly said, &quot;It's now time for the African-American leadership, including President Obama, to stop the nonsense. Walk away from the world of victimization and grievance and lead the way out of this mess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exactly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black leaders, including the president, need to step up and start talking about the real causes of crime and poverty in black communities. So should our gutless media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a year the president and black leaders have cynically exploited a tragedy to &quot;prove&quot; that society still needs to do much more for blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead they should be using Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death as an opportunity to start an honest national discussion about what the black community needs to do for itself.</SPAN></P>
