<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news about the landlord of Virginia's new health commissioner was very informative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as a public health educator/researcher for some 30 years at VCU's School of Medicine, I was curious about Dr. Cynthia Romero's preparation for being Virginia's health commissioner, a job usually calling for specialty training and credentials in public health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I have been retired for some years now and am no longer up-to-date on what Virginia law says about this, the past assumption in the commonwealth and other states was that a physician trained only in a clinical field (such as Romero's board certification in family practice) was not equipped or allowed to be the chief medical officer of a state health department. The past practice of appointing only well-trained and experienced public health physicians as our health commissioner was strictly observed. This made public health policy decisions comply with medical and scientific standards, not political or ideological ones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps more ought to be known about how and why Romero was appointed and why she would accept this war-torn position. Health commissioner is ordinarily awarded to public health physicians who know firsthand details about the complex services in a state health department, which protects the public from preventable disease, disability, accidents, death and mass catastrophes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Store toxic waste in Detroit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is time for Detroit to start a new industry. Make the empty acres a nuclear and/or a hazardous-waste disposal site. Federal funds could be used. A training facility could be built. Sunflowers could be planted to absorb soil surface radiation. A laboratory could be built to research ways to neutralize hazardous chemicals. This idea would be a whole lot better than bankruptcy. And no, I don't think Detroit is a wasteland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, believers can't do that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You headlined a letter &quot;Believers can also support choice.&quot; The only response is, &quot;No Way!&quot; Believers cannot support the killing of an unborn human being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Believers know that embryologists state as fact that life begins at conception. Believers know that obstetricians treat the fetus as an independent life. Believers know that the fetus is treated in law as an independent human being, that the killing of a fetus in a criminal act is considered by law as murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides in this discussion, pro-choice and pro-life, are not on an equal footing. A mother has no moral right to allow her unborn child to be destroyed. This is what believers believe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pitts' column deepens division</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a tragedy when someone as young as Trayvon Martin loses his life in such a senseless way. The story saddens anyone who has children or knows what it is to lose a child. My grandson is only two years younger than Martin was at the time of his death. I can only imagine how I would feel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Op/Ed piece by Leonard Pitts &quot;Wake . . . up&quot; has saddened me even more. I find his column incendiary. It can only serve to deepen the void between races. His bitter words help infuse a global perception that there is no solution to our social dilemma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This type of journalism has no place in a country struggling to eradicate racism and prejudice. The more the media focus on our differences and espouse anger and hatred at every turn or event, the longer it will take for us to understand and accept one another as the brothers we are. No law can ever accomplish this. This is learned and earned through mutual trust and respect over time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps, the day will come when racism and prejudice no longer exist in the United States, but words like those expressed by Pitts fuel more distrust and misunderstanding. It is a pity he does not use his words for inspiration and healing, because those are something that America desperately needs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supplements are safer than drugs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the article &quot;Regulations differ for supplements&quot;: The reason dietary supplements aren't regulated like drugs is because they're much safer than drugs. It's the same reason the Department of Energy regulates nuclear reactors differently than fireplaces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is the FDA drug-approval system the best model for safety? Properly prescribed FDA-approved drugs kill an estimated 100,000 people and receive approximately 550,000 adverse event reports a year. FDA-approved opioid painkillers now kill more Americans each year than automobile accidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dietary supplements can't go through the FDA drug-approval process, which requires expensive double-blind studies that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Because natural products (such as dietary supplements) can't be patented, supplement companies can never recoup the astronomical costs of these trials. As a direct consequence, natural (and oftentimes exponentially safer and cheaper) remedies are dismissed as ineffective and subjected to legal threats by hostile regulatory agencies and organizations like Public Citizen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't balance budget on backs of the ill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 1, under the cover of a popular vacation week, Medicare proposed a devastating surprise for my dialysis patients -- a 12 percent Medicare budget cut. This disappointing plan was triggered by congressionally mandated fiscal cliff cuts. The cuts are so deep they could restrict dialysis services and force clinic closures just as kidney disease is growing. It's cruel, unusual and unjust to have critically ill people accept reduced care or travel longer distances for dialysis. My patients could die within two weeks without their three weekly dialysis treatments. The life-sustaining nature makes this budget issue unique, especially in Virginia where more than 15,442 residents have kidney failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you don't think kidney disease impacts you -- think again. The silent killer is caused by high blood pressure and diabetes and affects one in seven Americans, making it the eighth-leading cause of death. When the disease progresses to kidney failure, my patients must seek transplantation (which is rare) or get dialysis four hours, three times a week to stay alive. In Virginia, kidney failure has increased 15.8 percent increase since 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dialysis professionals like me have worked hard to improve health outcomes. In 2011 we adopted a cost-effective payment system which became a Medicare model. Yet our progress is being rewarded with Medicare cuts. Why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medicare covers the cost of dialysis, regardless of age. But it barely covers the cost of complex dialysis care now, and new cuts would be disastrous. Congress must not balance budgets on the backs of kidney failure patients. The sick and vulnerable deserve better.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local musicians need to eat, too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent article noted that the State Fair of Virginia is putting out the call for free musicians. As a professional musician, I am very dismayed that the State Fair and the Virginia Farm Bureau look at the local arts as an entitled commodity with no real monetary value. Furthermore, the Virginia Farm Bureau's comment of loving to work with musicians who play in garages, parking lots et cetera, will only yield amateur, non-professional musicians or hobbyists, which will just downgrade the overall quality of entertainment at the fair -- which claims on its website that it offers &quot;the best of Virginia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have no problem with periodically playing a charitable benefit for a worthy nonprofit organization, but the State Fair is for-profit. The fair is paying the &quot;national&quot; acts performing there and the array of electricians, plumbers, groundskeepers, even parking attendants -- why not local musicians?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm sure the fair will find bands willing to play for free, undermining the value of working musicians. And that's the problem -- once you devalue a service, it will be seen as having no intrinsic value to anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shame on the State Fair of Virginia for trying to take advantage of local musicians. I will be boycotting the State Fair this year and asking other musicians, entertainers and supporters of the arts to join me.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia could stand outfrom the rest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having spent time in China with Charles McPhillips and Brad Haneberg marketing the many business advantages of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I concur with the recommendations made in their Commentary column, &quot;Virginia needs investment from overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese business has a very real desire to invest offshore due to its government's inconsistent monetary policy. The U.S., with its stable business climate, large consumer base and strong entrepreneur activity, is a logical Chinese target for investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia can stand out from the other 49 states by encouraging new foreign capital to invest in the commonwealth through a mechanism like the Virginia In-Bound Growth Funds option. As suggested, we have an incentive tool, the Governor's Opportunity Fund , to help leverage this foreign capital and keep the investment tied to Virginia based on job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an economic developer who has worked exclusively in the commonwealth since 1976, I believe we need to explore new ways of bringing jobs and capital investment to the state. Why not explore the Virginia In-Bound Growth Funds concept?It could provide a whole new stream of business opportunities that are not currently being explored.</SPAN></P>
