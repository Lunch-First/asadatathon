<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Why does the Gazette not condemn the Democrats' war on women? Weiner, Spitzer and the mayor of San Diego all treat women like garbage but because they are pro-abortion the Gazette gives them a free pass on criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-It will be interesting to see if the NRA and conservatives defend the first black man who shoots a white man and invokes the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law. I believe I already know the answer to that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-If you think this country is not more economically sound now than when Bush was president then you are not educated in economics. Or, you do not know how to read the stock market reports. Or is it that you just despise a black president?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-If the evidence of a person being a Christian are joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith, why do I virtually never meet a Christian who displays these characteristics?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I thought that government agencies were to answer their phones. I have tried calling the DMV since 8 a.m. for the two numbers I have for them and have gotten no answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The ethics council for lawyers in West Virginia would not know an ethics violation if it fell from the sky and hit them in the head. Their website says lying is a violation but even when given evidence in writing, they ignore it. A powerful lawyer here can get away with anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Is Melissa Lee capable of walking a mile in George Zimmerman's shoes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I think it is time for Casey the lobbyist to step aside and support Poore, the politician who can win. You know you can't win, Nick. Who do you think you are fooling? You do one thing - you lobby - and not always in the best interest of the working folks in West Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Reagan and Bush all went home on occasion for breaks from D.C. Obama doesn't have a home to go back to so he vacations someplace expensive and different trip after trip. Comparing Bush/Obama vacations is comparing apples to oranges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Have you heard much about the large clips of ammunition lately? Joe Manchin's faux stance for background checks is only to take the attention off the large clips, which is one of the NRA's main moneymakers. It's intended to make him look like he's a &quot;stand up&quot; guy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The Pentagon says we're at war with &quot;Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces,&quot; but the identity of the &quot;associated forces&quot; is classified. Our nation is at war with people, but citizens aren't allowed to know who those people are. Just trust the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Trayvon Martin was such a handful he wasn't living with either one of his parents. Maybe instead of blaming gun laws and neighborhood watch volunteers for their son's death they should look in the mirror and take some of the responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Another day, another Leonard Pitts column about being black. Yawn. At least he made it clear that the point of Obama's speech was to increase racial animosity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Conservatives would have you believe that everything wrong with America is the fault of Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, and that there was no president between their presidencies. And you know what? They are right. There was no president between Clinton and Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-To the reader who said President Obama had been on vacation a total of 83 days. Seems you have your stats all wrong. Obama has been in office more than five years and has been on vacation or out to lunch or campaigning 100 percent of the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I'm still an Obama supporter, but his commentary bemoaning us for locking our doors at the sight of an approaching stranger as proof we are racist was unfair. Please publish the ethnic composition of our prison population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-While the city of Detroit has been declared bankrupt, with its public assets put up for sale to the highest private-sector bidder, somehow public money will still be found to fund almost half the $650 million cost of a new hockey arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-In 2011, a man with a Hispanic name shot a white man, walking away, in the back, at the Logan Walmart, but the Gazette editorial writers were relatively silent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-To the person who said Obama should keep his mouth shut, I guess you like Zimmerman think it is all right to shoot unarmed kids, especially black kids who wear a hoodie! The president is right! What if it had been your kid? Then what would you say?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-There is an easy solution to the problem about kids wanting to go to certain schools. You go to school where you live! If you don't like the school either move or work to improve the school your children go to.</SPAN></P>
