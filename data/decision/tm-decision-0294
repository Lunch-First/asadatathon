<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Occupy Elgin plans protest:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the Trayvon Martin verdict, the group Occupy Elgin is planning a protest on Saturday calling for repeal of stand-your-ground self-defense laws across the nation. The protest will take place at 1 p.m. at the corner of Grove Avenue and Kimball Street, across from Gail Borden Public Library in Elgin, organizers said in a news release. There will be an informal &quot;speak out&quot; at 2 p.m. during which people from the community can take turns speaking about their reaction to Zimmerman verdict. Organizers didn't immediately return calls for comment Wednesday. A Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of murder and manslaughter charges after he shot and killed Martin in February 2012. Florida adopted its stand-your-ground law in 2005; among other things, the law eliminated the duty to retreat before using deadly force.</SPAN></P>
