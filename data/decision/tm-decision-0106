<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">After reading the noble-sounding ideas such as &quot;no park fees&quot; and &quot;vote of the people,&quot; of Clark County Commissioners Tom Mielke and David Madore and state Sen. Don Benton, R-Vancouver, I now am watching, in slow motion, their hot air &quot;balloons&quot; crash into the real world with consequences affecting all of us.</SPAN></P>

<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">I find it refreshing to read stories and columns by Lou Brancaccio, John Laird, Erik Hidle, The Columbian editorials as well as the many letters from my fellow readers.

<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">In rebuttal to Frank Bailey's July 23 letter &quot;Environmentalists talk the talk,&quot; it is global climate change that Bill McKibben (</SPAN></P>

<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">) is fighting against, and not to enhance the wealth of oil, gas, and coal corporations. Most environmentalists, including McKibben, recognize the necessity of continuing to use carbon fuels for mobile applications. It's highly compact portable energy and we don't have the technology yet to replace it. But for the production of electricity? That has to stop ASAP. There are alternatives that can be scaled up to replace carbon fuels if we have a mindset to do so. This is going to require compromises and yes, we all will be making sacrifices.</SPAN></P>

<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive vice president, said, &quot;The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.&quot; With that in mind, then, a young man being stalked by a man with a gun had no right to protect himself physically, but if he also had a gun and felt his life was in danger, he could have shot the stalker. And if he had shot his stalker would the jury have found him not guilty?</SPAN></P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">It's suggested by many that everyone should carry a gun for protection. So if everyone has a gun and can &quot;stand your ground&quot; when he or she feels threatened, how will we be able to tell the good guy from the bad guy? A bad guy doesn't always look bad, i.e. Ted Bundy, while some may think a dark-skinned man in a hoodie looks really bad.</SPAN></P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">I have an idea. When a gun is purchased the owner will be given a &quot;Good Guy&quot; or &quot;Bad Guy&quot; badge to wear. But who decides which badge you get to wear?</SPAN></P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="100.0%" CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c12">What difference does it make? You have a right to carry a gun, you have a right to stand your ground, and you have a right to pull the trigger. Right?</SPAN></P>

Both of these people promote reverse racism. The Trayvon Martin-George Zimmerman case would not even have been in the news if the roles were reversed. And Jackson and Sharpton would be celebrating about justified self-protection. These so-called civil rights leaders promote hatred in this country and should be rejected by the media.</SPAN></P>
