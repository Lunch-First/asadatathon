<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the Trayvon Martin verdict, the group Occupy Elgin is planning a protest on Saturday calling for repeal of stand-your-ground self-defense laws across the nation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest will take place at 1 p.m. at the corner of Grove Avenue and Kimball Street, across from Gail Borden Public Library in Elgin, organizers said in a news release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be an informal &quot;speak out&quot; at 2 p.m. during which people from the community can take turns speaking about their reaction to Zimmerman verdict. Organizers didn't immediately return calls seeking comment Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of murder and manslaughter charges after he shot and killed Martin in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida adopted its stand-your-ground law in 2005; among other things, the law eliminated the duty to retreat before using deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elgin resident Danise Habun posted information about Saturday's rally on her Facebook page. She's not a member of Occupy Elgin, but she supports the rally's cause, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict that came out of Florida was a travesty,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm standing in support of efforts to make sure that something like that doesn't happen again. I think it was a ridiculous verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman should have been &quot;punished in some way&quot; for killing Martin, Habun said. &quot;It should never have happened -- both the murder and the acquittal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elgin resident Elvira Ramirez said she also plans to attend the rally, because she doesn't support stand-your-ground laws. &quot;It makes it really easy for people to commit crimes,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also believes that Zimmerman's trial was unfair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't really know what the story is behind it all. We only have one person's story,&quot; she said. &quot;I believe (during the trial) they tried Martin as a defendant, and Zimmerman as a victim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
