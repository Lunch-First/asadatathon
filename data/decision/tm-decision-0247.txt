 A second juror in the trial of George Zimmerman has given a TV interview saying the former neighborhood watch volunteer "got away with murder" when he was acquitted earlier this month in the shooting death of black, unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin.  
The woman, identified  as juror B29, who is part Hispanic, said she would have liked to convict Zimmerman of murdering Martin but said her hands were tied by a lack of evidence. "You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty," she told ABC  in an interview due to be aired on this  morning. "But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence." - (Reuters)
