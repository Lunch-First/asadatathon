TO THE EDITORS:
I believe the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial was an absolute travesty of justice, to say the least.
If Zimmerman had obeyed the police order to stay in his car, none of this would have happened and Trayvon Martin would be alive today.
Once he exited the car and took on the role of predator, Zimmerman placed all forthcoming actions and consequences upon his shoulders.
Because of his apparent need to feel like a big man, his actions and stupidity brought about much sorrow and pain, none of which seem to affect him.
What a waste of humanity Zimmerman is.
