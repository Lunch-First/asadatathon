<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second juror to speak publicly told ABC News in an interview made available Thursday that she feels George Zimmerman got away with murder for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, but that there wasn't enough evidence at trial to convict him under Florida law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B29 told Robin Roberts that she favoured convicting Zimmerman of second-degree murder when deliberations began by the sixmember, all-women jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was the juror that was going to give them a hung jury,&quot; she said. &quot;I fought to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by the second day of deliberating, she realized there wasn't enough proof to convict the 29-year-old neighbourhood watch volunteer of a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was acquitted earlier this month of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the 2012 slaying of the unarmed 17-year-old. The Miami teenager was shot and killed during a confrontation with Zimmerman in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she feels like she owes Martin's parents an apology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt like I let a lot of people down, and I'm thinking to myself, 'Did I go the right way? Did I go the wrong way?&quot;' she said.</SPAN></P>
