GEORGE Zimmerman helped pull a Florida family from an overturned SUV just days after being acquitted of murdering unarmed black teen TrayvonMartin, police said Monday. 
As the country erupted in protest over the controversial outcome of his trial, the former neighborhood watchman jumped into action to save a white family.
Mark Gerstle lost control of his blue 2004 Ford Explorer and overturned at a Sanford, Fla., intersection, just a mile from where Zimmerman shot Trayvon to death on Feb. 26, 2012. Gerstle, his wife, Dana, and their two children were trapped in the SUV when Zimmerman happened along to pull them to safety. No one was seriously hurt in the accident around 5:45 p.m. Thursday.
"George didn't look to see what race the people were before he helped them out of the car," Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, told the Daily News.
