</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The White House has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, everybody. This sound system is really powerful. Today, I'd like to update the American people on two issues that I've been monitoring closely these last several days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First of all, we continue to make progress in carrying out our targeted military operations in Iraq. Last week, I authorized two limited missions: protecting our people and facilities inside of Iraq, and a humanitarian operation to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians stranded on a mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week ago, we assessed that many thousands of Yezidi men, women and children had abandoned their possessions to take refuge on Mount Sinjar in a desperate attempt to avoid slaughter. We also knew that ISIL terrorists were killing and enslaving Yezidi civilians in their custody, and laying siege to the mountain. Without food or water, they faced a terrible choice -- starve on the mountain, or be slaughtered on the ground. That's when America came to help. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last week, the U.S. military conducted humanitarian air drops every night -- delivering more than 114,000 meals and 35,000 gallons of fresh water. We were joined in that effort by the United Kingdom, and other allies pledged support. Our military was able to successfully strike ISIL targets around the mountain, which improved conditions for civilians to evacuate the mountain safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, a small team of Americans -- military and civilian -- completed their review of the conditions on the mountain. They found that food and water have been reaching those in need, and that thousands of people have been evacuating safely each and every night. The civilians who remain continue to leave, aided by Kurdish forces and Yezidis who are helping to facilitate the safe passage of their families. So the bottom line is, is that the situation on the mountain has greatly improved and Americans should be very proud of our efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the skill and professionalism of our military -- and the generosity of our people -- we broke the ISIL siege of Mount Sinjar; we helped vulnerable people reach safety; and we helped save many innocent lives. Because of these efforts, we do not expect there to be an additional operation to evacuate people off the mountain, and it's unlikely that we're going to need to continue humanitarian air drops on the mountain. The majority of the military personnel who conducted the assessment will be leaving Iraq in the coming days. And I just want to say that as Commander-in-Chief, I could not be prouder of the men and women of our military who carried out this humanitarian operation almost flawlessly. I'm very grateful to them and I know that those who were trapped on that mountain are extraordinarily grateful as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the situation remains dire for Iraqis subjected to ISIL's terror throughout the country, and this includes minorities like Yezidis and Iraqi Christians; it also includes Sunnis, Shia and Kurds. We're going to be working with our international partners to provide humanitarian assistance to those who are suffering in northern Iraq wherever we have capabilities and we can carry out effective missions like the one we carried out on Mount Sinjar without committing combat troops on the ground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We obviously feel a great urge to provide some humanitarian relief to the situation and I've been very encouraged by the interest of our international partners in helping on these kinds of efforts as well. We will continue air strikes to protect our people and facilities in Iraq. We have increased the delivery of military assistance to Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting ISIL on the front lines. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, perhaps most importantly, we are urging Iraqis to come together to turn the tide against ISIL -- above all, by seizing the enormous opportunity of forming a new, inclusive government under the leadership of Prime Minister-designate Abadi. I had a chance to speak to Prime Minister-designate Abadi a few days ago, and he spoke about the need for the kind of inclusive government -- a government that speaks to all the people of Iraq -- that is needed right now. He still has a challenging task in putting a government together, but we are modestly hopeful that the Iraqi government situation is moving in the right direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, second, I want to address something that's been in the news over the last couple of days and that's the situation in Ferguson, Missouri. I know that many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images we've seen in the heartland of our country, as police have clashed with people protesting. Today, I'd like us all to take a step back and think about how we're going to be moving forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning, I received a thorough update on the situation from Attorney General Eric Holder, who has been following it and been in communication with his team. I've already tasked the Department of Justice and the FBI to independently investigate the death of Michael Brown, along with local officials on the ground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Justice is also consulting with local authorities about ways that they can maintain public safety without restricting the right of peaceful protest and while avoiding unnecessary escalation. I made clear to the Attorney General that we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened, and to see that justice is done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also just spoke with Governor Jay Nixon of Missouri. I expressed my concern over the violent turn that events have taken on the ground, and underscored that now is the time for all of us to reflect on what's happened, and to find a way to come together going forward. He is going to be traveling to Ferguson. He is a good man and a fine governor, and I'm confident that, working together, he is going to be able to communicate his desire to make sure that justice is done and his desire to make sure that public safety is maintained in an appropriate way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, it's important to remember how this started. We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old. His family will never hold Michael in their arms again. And when something like this happens, the local authorities -- including the police -- have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death, and how they are protecting the people in their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting. There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protestors in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. And here, in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground. Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those of us in positions of authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know that emotions are raw right now in Ferguson and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened. There are going to be different accounts of how this tragedy occurred. There are going to be differences in terms of what needs to happen going forward. That's part of our democracy. But let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law; a basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protest; a reverence for the dignity of every single man, woman and child among us; and the need for accountability when it comes to our government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So now is the time for healing. Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson. Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done. And I've asked that the Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney on the scene continue to work with local officials to move that process forward. They will be reporting to me in the coming days about what's being done to make sure that happens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks very much, everybody.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">7123  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The White House has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">**Please see below for a correction marked with an asterisk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12:00 P.M. EDT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Good morning. I apologize for the weather, but we'll try and make it up to you here. I'm going to let Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes lead us off. He's got about 10, 15 minutes. He can handle sort of the nitty-gritty on the foreign policy pieces, and then I'll flesh everything else out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: Great. Thanks, everybody. Let me just begin by giving you an update on the President's morning. He was briefed again by National Security Advisor Susan Rice. He did a phone call with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel. We'll have a fuller readout of that call, as it just recently completed. They obviously were focused on the ongoing efforts to get a sustainable cease-fire in place with respect to Gaza. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that, I'm happy to take questions. Julie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Hey, Ben. Can you update us on the President's thinking in terms of using U.S. troops to do some kind of rescue mission at Sinjar Mountain? And even though that wouldn't be combat troops on the ground in a traditional sense, wouldn't that put Americans at risk in a similar way?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: Well, again, first of all, we have a very specific objective with respect to the humanitarian situation, and that is to get food, water and emergency supplies to the population on this mountain, and also, as necessary, to take airstrikes against ISIL as they threaten the people on that mountain. And to date, I believe we've taken in the range of seven airstrikes associated with that mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, there needs to be a lasting solution that gets that population to a safe space where they can receive more permanent assistance. So what the President has done is authorized the deployment of 130, roughly, U.S. military personnel who will assess the situation on Sinjar Mountain and in northern Iraq. They then, again, will make recommendations about how to follow through on an effort to get the people off that mountain into a safe place. And you heard Prime Minister Cameron indicate today they're cooperating with us in those efforts as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, these 130 personnel are not going to be in a combat role in Iraq. They're there on a temporary basis to make assessments about how to get the population off that mountain. This would be a humanitarian effort to get them to a safe space. There are a range of ways for doing that. We haven't made decisions about how to carry out that mission because we want to get the readout from this assessment team first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q But given that it's a pretty urgent situation, how quickly do you expect the President to get recommendations from this team?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: I think relatively quickly here -- in a matter of days. We don't believe it's sustainable to just have permanent airdrops to this population on the mountain. Some of them have been able to escape. But again, we want to get options in place and move them to a safer place. There are a range of ways for doing that. Again, we're going to be cooperating with Kurdish forces who are also operating in the region, other international partners. And our goal here is to work with the Iraqis and with international partners so that these people can get off that mountain to a safer place. Again, we don't believe that that involves U.S. troops reentering a combat role in Iraq. It involves, frankly, a very difficult logistical challenge of moving folks who are in danger on that mountain to a safer position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q But there would be some danger to U.S. personnel that would be involved in a mission like that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: Well, look, if at any time you have -- I mean, even now, as we speak, we have pilots flying over Iraq; that always carries with it danger. So in any effort, there are always dangers involved. I think the key point here is that the U.S. forces -- the role of U.S. forces is not one of reentering combat on the ground, it's how to provide humanitarian assistance to this affected population. And again, in terms of the kinetic actions that are being taken, those are in the form of airstrikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q But, Ben, if they come under fire, if that kind of mission is launched and they come under fire, they would be in combat, would they not?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: Well, look, as a bottom line, force protection is always a mission for U.S. personnel in any country in the world. We've already reinforced our embassy in Baghdad and our facility in Erbil with military personnel who are there for the express purpose of protecting those facilities. So any U.S. military personnel anywhere in the world has the ability to protect themselves, but the purpose and the mission that they are going to Iraq for is not to engage in combat. This is to make an assessment on a temporary basis about how we move that population off the mountain and into a safe place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q And what do you make of some of the assessments you've heard from some of your Republican critics in the last couple days that ISIS does pose a national security threat to the United States? Is that also the opinion of the President, the White House?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: Well, look, the President has ordered this military action in Iraq because of the threat that they pose to our facility and our people in Erbil. So, by definition, we absolutely believe that ISIL poses a threat to U.S. persons and U.S. personnel. We're focused on dealing with that threat right now in Iraq so that the terrorists cannot advance on Erbil. The airstrikes that we have launched have stopped those advances and given space for the Kurdish forces, the Peshmerga, to engage ISIL. But we are always monitoring not just the security of our facilities and our people in places like Baghdad and Erbil -- also monitoring potential plots against the United States, and we'll continue to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Is one of the options under consideration is creating a safe corridor for the refugees to get off that mountain?<BR>MR. RHODES: Yes, there are a range of options. I don't want to get ahead of decisions that haven't been made yet. We're going to rely on what the teams report back in terms of their assessment. But you look at corridors, you look at airlifts, you look at different ways to move people who are in a very dangerous place on that mountain to a safer position. And that's exactly what our team is doing on the ground now in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q And is the President willing -- I know he said over and over again no ground troops in Iraq. But is he willing to consider the option of sending a certain number of troops in there for the purposes of establishing something like a force protection, like you're saying, or a safe corridor for them to get out?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: Well, we haven't made that decision at this point, Jon. We want to see what the circumstances are, see what options are available for moving those people who are trapped on the mountain. We obviously have not just U.S. personnel who could potentially get engaged in that type of effort. We have Kurdish forces who are engaged in the area with ISIL. We have international partners who also want to support the provision of humanitarian assistance. So we'll look at what the best way and the safest way is to get those people off that mountain. And the President will be making decisions after he hears back from the military about what they found on the ground there in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Just to clarify what I'm asking -- because the President has said over and over again no combat troops, no ground troops in Iraq. Does that statement extend to the idea of a safe corridor -- establishing a safe corridor? Is he willing -- is that something -- so in other words, are you saying -- I think what you're saying is the President hasn't ruled out sending in additional troops to establish a safe corridor for those refugees to get off that mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: Well, again, he hasn't received a recommendation to establish a corridor at this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q I'm asking what he's ruled out. Because he's ruled out many time ground troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: What he's ruled out is reintroducing U.S. forces into combat, on the ground, in Iraq. But there are a variety of ways in which we can support the safe removal of those people from the mountain. And frankly, we already have people on the ground working with Kurdish forces in a joint operation center in Erbil. So there are ways in which we can coordinate with Iraqi forces on the ground, for instance, in seeking to combat the threat from ISIL and to bring people to a safe space. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But again, as we make decisions about what the best course of action is to bring those people to safety, we will be very transparent about that. I think the principle holds that we're not putting ground forces in a combat role in Iraq. We're using U.S. military personnel to assess what the best way is to bring people to safety and what the best way is to provide them with humanitarian assistance. But again, always, force protection is a mission for U.S. personnel wherever they are in the world. That's certainly true of the reinforcements that are protecting our facilities in Erbil and Baghdad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q What information does the U.S. have about how many people still are stranded on the mountain and where exactly they are?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: So there have been a broad range of estimates to date that go into the tens of thousands. We believe that some number of thousands of people have been able to escape from the mountain, but not in a safe enough way and to a safe enough space that we're confident that the remaining people who are trapped there can get off. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of what these teams can do, working with Kurdish forces, is try to get an understanding of the scope of the challenge on the mountain, as well as the routes to remove people. To date, we've also provided over 100,000 meals, some 27,000 gallons of water. We'll continue those airdrops. The British have done a number of airdrops, and they're going to continue to do that. We've had offers of assistance from France, Canada, Australia. So we're getting aid to the people who are on the mountain while also trying to determine that best means to bring them to a safe place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Ben, Maliki is showing resistance to stepping down as Prime Minister. Does the U.S. have any message for him specifically after this new Prime Minister-designate has been chosen?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: Yes, I think the message to all of Iraq's leaders is there is a peaceful process in place to get a new government for Iraq. There's a new president. There's a new speaker of parliament. And a Shia alliance of different political blocs has put forward Dr. Abadi as a candidate for Prime Minister, and now the President has asked him to form a government. So in our view, he is clearly the Prime Minister-designate in Iraq. This process now needs to go forward for him to put together a government and submit it to parliament. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that is the process in place that all Iraqis have to respect. And frankly, any efforts to derail that process, any efforts to use violence instead of working peacefully through the political process will be rejected not just by the United States, but by Iraqis themselves, by the international community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we want to see, again, a peaceful context for this process to conclude. There's an enormous opportunity with a new Prime Minister-designate in place to get a unity government that all of Iraq's different factions can buy into, can support, and then turn the focus to where it needs to be, which is combating the threat from ISIL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Do you think Maliki is trying to derail the process?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: Well, again, to date, the process has moved forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q He's still there, though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: He's still there. There's a 30-day period now that Dr. Abadi has been designated as the next Prime Minister for him to form his government and present it to parliament. That is the step that needs to take place for this to be formalized. So that is an ongoing process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I think our message to Prime Minister Maliki and to all Iraqi leaders is this is the one process that is consistent with the Iraqi constitution that is going to lead to a new government, and he needs to respect that process, let it go forward. Because frankly, this is not being imposed on anybody from outside of Iraq. This is what the Iraqis themselves have decided to do, including, importantly, not just the Kurdish President and the Sunni Speaker, but the different Shia political factions that put forward Dr. Abadi as their candidate for Prime Minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Will the White House be glad to see Maliki off the world stage?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: The White House will be very glad to see a new government in place with Prime Minister Abadi at the lead of that government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We believe it's necessary, frankly, to bring the country together. What's happened in the course of the last several years is you did not have Iraqis working together across different sectarian and communal lines. You had a Sunni population that became disaffected. That led to a loss of confidence in certain parts of Iraq in the Iraqi security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we need, and this is -- often we're asked, what is the long-term strategy for dealing with ISIL? I think it's very clear: You get a new government in place. That provides the basis for all of Iraq's communities to support the government of Baghdad and to turn the focus where it needs to be, which is on combating ISIL. We will be providing a training-and-equipping security assistance and advice to Iraqi and Kurdish forces, and then we can begin to squeeze the space where ISIL is operating and start to push them back. But that demands the cooperation of all Iraqis. And that's the opportunity we have with this new government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Ben?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q You've said that the allies have offered to help with humanitarian efforts. Does that extend to getting the refugees off the mountain, either through a corridor or airlifts? And also, do we need personnel up there to help distribute the aid that's being dropped?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: So, in the first instance, Wendell, the Iraqis and the Kurdish forces in particular have been engaged. They have a presence on the mountain, and they will certainly be cooperating with us in this effort. The Brits have been the most forward-leaning of all of our allies in terms of doing humanitarian airdrops. Prime Minister Cameron today indicated that they want to work with us as we work to get that population to a safe place. So the United Kingdom has been fully in coordination with us in the provision of humanitarian assistance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, we have offers of support from a number of allies like France, Australia, Canada. We'll be in discussions with them about what they can do, both as it relates to helping the Yezidi population that has been trapped on the mountain, but also more broadly, helping bring relief to the displaced persons in northern Iraq, which includes not just Yezidis, but an enormous number of Iraqi Christians and others who have been driven from their homes by ISIL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q And distributing food, is there no concern about the chaos that can be caused by just dropping supplies in there and letting the people sort it out?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: Again, we have done several airdrops I think every night. We have good fidelity on where the food and water is dropping. We're able to watch how that reaches the population, given the assets we have in the area. And we're able to make sure we're trying to drop food and water in places where we believe people are concentrated. We've done these types of humanitarian airdrops in other instances. And so, again, we have an ability to focus on where we believe people are most impacted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But part of what these assessment teams will do who are going to northern Iraq is get a better understanding of the situation on the mountain where folks are. And so that can help inform, again, both how we move them off the mountain, but also how we're providing that humanitarian assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q So if it's not being equitably distributed, then does that suggest a more -- a presence, an American presence on the mountain?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: Look, I think it's -- when you talk about 100,000 meals, 27,000 gallons of water, that's not including the British support; there's clearly a lot of food and water, and other support that is reaching the mountain and the people on the mountain. But it's not -- we would be the first to acknowledge that's not a permanent solution, just dropping food and water in perpetuity from the air. So that's what we're turning our focus to right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q I think you're going to appreciate the specificity of this question. When the President asks military advisers for recommendations, he spells out his own limits. Has the President told his military advisers, don't bring me a recommendation that includes U.S. military personnel on the ground as part of a corridor to remove the Yezidis or anyone else from Sinjar? Is that off the table entirely as far as what the President is asking for as to actionable decisions he can make there? Or has he told them, if there is a way that U.S. ground forces can expedite that, I am open to that and bring me your best thoughts on making that happen?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: Major, I'd say two things. First is, we have a range of ways that we can support this type of effort. We bring very unique capabilities in terms of our logistical capacity, in terms of our intelligence capacity, in terms of how we can support and strengthen the Iraqi and Kurdish forces on the ground. The President's one limiting factor that he's communicated repeatedly in public and to the military is we don't want to be reintroducing U.S. forces into a combat role on the ground. But if they can --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q But if he defines it as a humanitarian mission, it's not a combat role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: What I'm saying is he's open to recommendations in which the United States is helping to facilitate the removal of these people from the mountain on a humanitarian mission, which we believe is separate than saying U.S. forces are going to be redeployed in Iraq in a combat role to take the fight to ISIL. The people who are on the ground fighting ISIL are the Kurdish forces and the Iraqi security forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are taking action from the air on the objectives of protecting our people and providing a humanitarian space for the Yezidis in particular on the mountain. If there's additional things that we can do as part of an effort to move them off the mountain, he'll certainly review those options. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q But you would acknowledge that defining it as a humanitarian mission doesn't mean it's not dangerous and it doesn't mean it couldn't turn into a combat situation? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: Major, absolutely there are dangers involved with any military operation. We would absolutely acknowledge that. There is danger when pilots are flying sorties. There's a danger when you're in a very difficult situation, as we are in Iraq. But he's confident that we can have a limited military objective. When people talk about whether or not the United States is going to be drawn more into another war in Iraq on the ground, I think what they need to know is we've laid out what the objectives are for our military, which are protecting our people and carrying out the humanitarian mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broader effort to take the fight to ISIL on the ground is being carried out by Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with our training, our arming, our advice. But again, they're the ones who are engaged in combat, not just around the perimeter of Erbil, but around other parts of Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Thank you, Ben.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RHODES: Thanks, guys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I have one quick announcement, and then we can get to your questions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama set a goal early in his first term to lay the foundation for the United States to lead the world with the highest proportion of college graduates by 2020. Last January, the President asked college presidents to increase college opportunity for all Americans, because a college degree remains one of the surest ways to get into the middle class, and is an especially powerful engine of social and economic mobility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, we are pleased to announce two things. First, 14 additional community colleges, as well as new private sector partnerships, are joining this effort. They will join more than 100 colleges and 40 nonprofits across the country who have been working to advance college opportunity earlier this year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the President and the First Lady will host the White House's second College Opportunity Summit on December 4th of this year. This year's summit will focus on building strong K-12 and higher education partnerships to encourage more students to go to college and to finish their degree, especially for first-generation, low-income and underrepresented students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These efforts have inspired engagement and supported the progress of educational leaders who are taking collective action in their schools on college campuses and in their communities to do all they can to help more low-income students prepare and succeed in college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that, I will take your questions. Nedra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Eric, can you give us the President's reaction to Secretary Clinton's interview in The Atlantic this week? And also his response to the phone call yesterday?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I think we addressed this yesterday. The President, indeed, appreciated Secretary Clinton's call, as he does every opportunity to chat with the former Secretary of State. They have a close and resilient relationship. I think you'll remember that in 2007, as some of you covered, they had about 20 presidential debates. And even after a hard-fought nomination contest, the President felt strongly he wanted her to be a key member of his team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why Secretary Clinton was the President's partner for four years in managing a wide array of complicated foreign policy situations. They continue to agree on a broad majority of issues confronting our country, even if they have the occasional policy difference. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President appreciates her counsel and advice, but more importantly he appreciates her friendship. And that's why he's looking forward to seeing her this evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q But was he upset that she was critical of him, especially at this time when he's juggling all these crises overseas?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I'm not going to go ahead and get into a behind-the-scenes here. I will say that the President appreciated her call yesterday, as he does every opportunity to chat with Secretary Clinton. I know that Secretary Clinton's folks put out a short readout of that call, but we are looking onwards and upwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Can you talk about what is going to happen tonight -- if there's going to be any media access for this hug that's greatly anticipated?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: As I'm sure most Americans watching who have a birthday party, they would all love you to join them. I don't expect open press access for this private social gathering of someone's birthday. I understand the press interest here, so we'll try and get you a sense of some sort of readout of what happens after the fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q And is that his only plan to see her, is at the party? Do they have any other plans together? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: That's correct. That's it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q No. (Laughter.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Jim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q That was a good try. But we all want to see if they do indeed hug here. So don't you think that that would be something that -- you would like to have that seen -- American people? Secretary Clinton, she said that she wants to hug it out, so why not let everybody see it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I believe the President and Secretary Clinton have had many hugs over the past few years. (Laughter.) I suspect many of them have been caught on camera. Again, I appreciate the request, but I do think this is a private social gathering for someone's birthday. So it's going to be hard to bring all of you lovely people in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q What about responding to the assertion that &quot;don't do stupid stuff&quot; is not a policy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I'm not sure anyone in this room would contest that doing stupid stuff is a good idea. But I also don't think anyone at the White House would assert that that is how we would describe our approach to foreign policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are looking for a description of how the President views the role of the United States in the world, I'd urge you to look at his speech at West Point a few months ago, which again, I think many of you were at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we do have sound, fundamental organizing principles that dictate how the President views the role of the United States in the world. Number one, that is confronting any threat to the national security interests of the United States. The President has said he will not hesitate on that front. And I'd also urge you read a little bit further in that speech when he talks about how military action cannot be the only or even primary component of our leadership in every instance. Just because we have the best hammer, doesn't mean that we have to hit every nail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so I think that the President has taken a thoughtful, deliberate approach to these issues. He laid out his general guidelines in that speech. I would refer you there. But our bottom line is the United States will use military force, unilaterally if necessary, and when our core interests demand it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And of course, most recently you've heard the President talk about our willingness to act on behalf of human dignity, and America's support for democracy and human rights goes beyond idealism. As the President said, it's part of our charge. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Let's take the other part of Mrs. Clinton's critique, saying that the failure to fully support the moderate rebels in Syria fueled the rise of ISIS. Does the President agree with that critique?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Jon, I think we've heard this critique. Secretary Clinton actually wrote about it in her book, so we know that that was an honest policy difference that the President --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Well, I don't think she wrote about the second part of it, fueling the rise of ISIS. What's new here is she is saying that this failure -- that's her word -- of the President to do this has fueled the rise of this terrorist group that we are now bombing in northern Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Jon, I think the President has been very clear in a number of press conferences and in a number of interviews why he didn't want to rush to provide military assistance to the Syrian opposition. As you may recall, he's talked about how it could have fallen into the hands of ISIL. Instead, we waited until we got to know the opposition better, had better working relationships, and worked to provide them non-lethal assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Eric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Just because this has been a sore point in the past -- if we're not going to be there, can you assure us there will be no other coverage, meaning the White House, of this event this evening, meaning nothing on Flickr or Twitter?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: You're asking me to rescind my invite? Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q It's a sore point, Eric. I'd like you to treat it seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Your point is well taken, and I can make that assurance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Secondarily, remembering the hat you used to wear in a political context separate from the White House, how comfortable is the President with the idea that Republicans now running in the midterm elections can just as easily quote Hillary Clinton criticizing Obama foreign policy as criticizing it themselves?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: You're right -- that is my old hat. I'm not going to do a diagnostics of the midterms from here. I will say the President has been very clear on the guiding principles that guide each of his foreign policy decisions. Secretary Clinton and the President have broad agreement on a wide range of issues. That's why they worked so effectively for four years even when there are small policy differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q -- a priority for the President; he had a fundraiser here just a couple of days ago to help the Democrats keep the Senate. And in this context, Republicans don't even have to say, don't listen to me, just listen to the former Secretary of State. Isn't that awkward for the President and all of his Democrats running for reelection?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I'm not going to handicap potential Republican campaign ads from the podium today. I will say, as you point out, keeping the Senate majority is a priority for the President. That's why he did attend the fundraiser two nights ago. He looks forward to doing what he can to maintain the majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Eric, what do you make of the criticism of the President being on vacation? The Republican National Committee has put out a web video showing him playing golf, and that sort of thing, with all these foreign crises. Has he had any second thoughts about whether this was a good idea to keep this vacation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Jim, as you know, the President is the President wherever he goes. He travels with a wide array of communications equipment, and we also travel with a staff that allows us to have robust operational capabilities. In this trip, that includes his National Security Advisor, Susan Rice; his Deputy National Security Advisor, Ben Rhodes; his Deputy Chief of Staff, Anita Breckenridge; and some very capable communications professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Has it felt like a vacation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I think it's fair to say there are, of course, ongoing complicated situations in the world, and that's why you've seen the President stay engaged. On Saturday, he spoke with Prime Minister Cameron, Prime Minister *President Hollande. He gave an update from the South Lawn and took your questions. While up here, he's spoken with Prime Minister Erdogan, President Poroshenko, Prime Minister Harper and Prime Minister Renzi. The President also had multiple national security briefings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I think, as many have observed over the past few days, there's never a perfect time for the President to take some time away with his family. But I think we can also all agree that it's valuable to recharge your batteries. And I just don't think the American people begrudge their President for taking some downtime with his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q And one very quick follow. Josh said last week that we might learn more about these in-person meetings that he might have. Care to shed any light on what the President is going to be doing when he goes back and actually interrupts his vacation to go to Washington?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: The President is still planning on returning to Washington on Sunday for meetings at the White House. I don't have too much more detail about that. We'll have more as the time comes. I will say that the President will be meeting with Vice President Biden while he's back in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Give us some indication, Eric -- will this formidable team the President has brought with him to Martha's Vineyard return with him to Washington for that brief session with advisors?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Some. Some of us will be returning; some of us will be staying in lovely Martha's Vineyard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Who will be returning?<BR><BR>MR. SCHULTZ: I'll get you the manifests as soon as I can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q The reason I ask is that would indicate the level of seriousness of what's going on back in Washington. Who stays and who doesn't would give us some indication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Eric Schultz is staying. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Could you talk a little bit about what the First Family has been doing in the last several days? We can't see what they're doing in the house. Have they been reading? Has the First Lady been exercising, working out? On the beach? Stuff that is happening while the President is on the golf course. Talk a little bit about what their day is like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Well, I do think it's fair to call this a working vacation, Mike -- I think probably an apt label for any presidential vacation. As you've seen, the President remains engaged -- getting briefs, speaking with foreign leaders, updating you all on ongoing situations. But I also can say the President is very much enjoying some downtime with his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you know, they've dined out at some of Martha's Vineyard's wonderful establishments. They've also had a few meals in. The President attended a fundraiser Monday evening to help keep the Democratic majority in the United States Senate. And as you know, he'll be attending a social gathering this evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may have noticed the President has already enjoyed a few rounds of golf, and I suspect you could see more of that to come. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q But I mean, that's all stuff that we know. But I'm talking about stuff that we don't know. What's been going on at the house? What books is the President reading? What kind of activities is the First Family, Mrs. Obama and the kids, involved in? Is Sasha here yet?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I don't have private moments from the family's vacation to read out to you from the podium right now. I can tell you that Sasha arrives next week and Malia will be traveling back with the President on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Eric, has the President worked on the issue of immigration in addition to working on foreign policy issues this week? And can you give us an update on the timing for the executive action --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Yes, the update on that timing is that it remains the end of summer. As you know, in June I believe, the President spoke in the Rose Garden asking his team -- specifically, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General -- to look at what he can do, given that House Republicans failed to bring up the comprehensive immigration bill, the bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill that passed the Senate. He asked his team to take a look, and they're going to report back in to him. And then we've put that timeline as end of summer, and I think that still holds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q And has he been doing anything on that issue this week?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Nothing to read out from here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Can you describe -- going back to the questions about Hillary Clinton -- just their relationship more generally? Since she left the White House, we know they've had -- or since she left the administration, rather, we know they've had lunch at the White House (inaudible) and talked on the phone. Can you describe that relationship more generally?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Sure. They are very close friends, as I mentioned. They came through a very heated primary contest in 2007. After that contest, the President asked I guess then-Senator Clinton to be a part of his administration. The President spoke about having a team of rivals be a member of his Cabinet, because he wanted strong, powerful voices who would offer candid advice. That's why I think they were such a strong partnership for the past four years in confronting the challenges across the world and advancing America's interests in each of those instances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since leaving the White House, I know they've been in touch regularly, as you point out, both in person and over the phone. And, again, they look forward to chatting tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathleen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q On that point, can you say whether the President has ever sought out Secretary Clinton's advice on foreign policy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I couldn't hear you, I'm sorry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Has the President ever sought out Secretary Clinton's advice on foreign policy? You say that they talk, but does he value her opinion?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: He definitely values her opinion, and they definitely both talk. When they see each other, they talk socially and they catch up on each other's personal lives. But I am sure they talk about the pressing issues of the day, as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q The good folks at Bloomberg had a story out today about a number of the President's top donors being those who have profited from corporate inversions -- the same kind the President has condemned. So I'm wondering, just a very simple question: Is the President going to be asking Democrats to return money contributed, or seeking to return money contributed by some of these corporate inversion magnates?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Why not? I mean, these guys are profiting off of the very practice the President has condemned and wants to see stopped.<BR>MR. SCHULTZ: As you know, Jon, we are not privy to the details and have no role in any individual company's plans, but what the President is focused on is stopping the problem. And stopping companies from renouncing their citizenship just to get out of paying their fair share of taxes is something that just can't wait. That is why the President called on Congress to do this. That is also why we've noted that the last time Congress closed this loophole was in 2004 with bipartisan majorities in the House and in the Senate, and signed into law by a Republican President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we're going to continue to explore whether there are steps we can take with or without waiting for Congress to further encourage companies to build their businesses and create jobs here at home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q But isn't this hypocritical? I mean, essentially the President has profited himself -- his political apparatus has profited by taking contributions from people that have made money doing exactly this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I guess I would understand the skepticism more if we weren't doing something to tackle the problem. But instead, we are going after any company that renounces its U.S. citizenship in order to pay less in taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q So why not renounce those donations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: What we're renouncing is the practice of using shifty accounting in order to avoid paying their fair share, and which subsequently passes on to middle-class families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q And can I ask one other? Ethel Kennedy laid down a direct challenge to the President of the United States, and she poured a big bucket of ice water over her head and asked the President to do same. I assume he's doing this today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Jon, I had a lot of thoughts on suggestions for who the President could designate to take this challenge, some of whom sit in this room. However, I think we'd release that the President is going to make a financial contribution instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q So he's not going to -- I mean, Ethel Kennedy did it, and the President can't do it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: As I said, I think we're going -- the President has actually already made a financial contribution on this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q And how much was it? How much was the contribution?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I'll have to check. I don't have the amount for you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Katie. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Eric, the President yesterday put out a statement on the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. And it looks like last night and early this morning, protesters were forced away by tear gas away in facing off the riot police. I'm just wondering if the President has a response to these latest development and what his personal thoughts are on the death of Mr. Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I don't have a response to any late-breaking developments overnight. I will say that yesterday the President and First Lady sent their condolences to the family of Michael Brown. Over the past few days, officials with the Department of Justice have begun monitoring the situation and working with local investigators on a full and thorough investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the President said yesterday, he believes the best way to honor the memory of Michael is through calm and reflection throughout the community and the country, as details gather on what happened last Friday. Again, the President and First Lady send their condolences to the family during this difficult time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would add that the Department of Justice has dedicated resources to this, and we've been in touch with civil rights leaders both in the area and nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Can you assure us that the President is not going to be dealing with the immigration issue when he goes back next week, in terms of a major announcement?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I can assure you we are not anticipating a major announcement on immigration when the President is in Washington this weekend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q -- publicly he might confer with the Attorney General and the Homeland Security Secretary?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any of those -- can you ask that again?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Will that be the time that he confers with Holder and Johnson on the issue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I don't know. I don't have those meetings set up for you. As soon as I have more details on those, we'll make sure we get them to you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Okay. And then I have a leftover question about Ukraine. So many of the statements that the press office and the Pentagon have issued over the past few days about the mission have talked about coordinating with the government of Iraq. With so much political turmoil there, and such a power struggle going on, do you really know who's in charge? Who is the White House coordinating with on this and other issues?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: You said Iraq, not Ukraine?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q I said Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Well, I can tell you that, as Ben expressed, we are very supportive of the steps the Iraqi government is taking to form their coalition government. We believe they've taken real, concrete -- we've seen real, concrete progress over the past few weeks and months on this front. And we have contacted all levels of the government in Iraq, both at the principal level -- I think the Vice President read out a call yesterday, the President has made a few calls -- and also members of the national security team, as well as over at the State Department. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q If it comes down to the question of who's in charge, is it Nouri al-Maliki?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I think, again, our belief is the people of Iraq need to select their government. And you've seen quite a bit of progress on that front over the last few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we off to the Seafood Shanty? (Laughter.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Eric, as a housekeeping matter, if you're going to be here when the President goes back to Washington, will briefings potentially occur here while he's in Washington? Or will there potentially be briefings back at the White House?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I don't anticipate briefings at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q And one other as clarification. The President mentioned the importance of a Democratic Senate because we may have Supreme Court vacancies. Was he saying -- was he giving some news there? Are we going to have Supreme Court vacancies before he leaves office?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: The President was speaking generally about the opportunity to fill vacancies if they were to arise. He wasn't speaking about any specific vacancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Eric, one more on Jim's question. If you're not going to brief at the White House, are you going to brief here? Is it likely or possible that Monday or Tuesday?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I'm happy to take requests. <BR>Q Well, some of us are going to -- may have to go back with the President, and the idea is if you're going to brief here, it might not be smart for us to go back with the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: Again, I'm going to let you all decide your own movements. I would tell you that we don't anticipate any major, significant news developments out of Washington those few days. As for what's going on up here, I think we'll just have to be in touch. We still have a few days before Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Eric, has Josh had his baby yet?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SCHULTZ: I have no personnel announcements at this time. (Laughter.) Thanks, guys.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1071  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The White House has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This afternoon, President Obama updated the nation on two issues that he's been monitoring closely over the past several days -- America's military operations in Iraq, and the situation in Ferguson, Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking first on Iraq, the President noted the progress the U.S. has made in carrying out &quot;targeted military operations&quot; in the country: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, I authorized two limited missions: protecting our people and facilities inside of Iraq, and a humanitarian operation to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians stranded on a mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A week ago, we assessed that many thousands of Yezidi men, women and children had abandoned their possessions to take refuge on Mount Sinjar in a desperate attempt to avoid slaughter. We also knew that ISIL terrorists were killing and enslaving Yezidi civilians in their custody, and laying siege to the mountain. Without food or water, they faced a terrible choice -- starve on the mountain, or be slaughtered on the ground. That's when America came to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the last week, the U.S. military conducted humanitarian air drops every night -- delivering more than 114,000 meals and 35,000 gallons of fresh water. We were joined in that effort by the United Kingdom, and other allies pledged support. Our military was able to successfully strike ISIL targets around the mountain, which improved conditions for civilians to evacuate the mountain safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, a small team of Americans -- military and civilian -- completed their review of the conditions on the mountain. They found that food and water have been reaching those in need, and that thousands of people have been evacuating safely each and every night. The civilians who remain continue to leave, aided by Kurdish forces and Yezidis who are helping to facilitate the safe passage of their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bottom line,&quot; President Obama said, &quot;is that the situation on the mountain has greatly improved and Americans should be very proud of our efforts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of the skill and professionalism of our military -- and the generosity of our people -- we broke the ISIL siege of Mount Sinjar; we helped vulnerable people reach safety; and we helped save many innocent lives. Because of these efforts, we do not expect there to be an additional operation to evacuate people off the mountain, and it's unlikely that we're going to need to continue humanitarian air drops on the mountain. The majority of the military personnel who conducted the assessment will be leaving Iraq in the coming days. And I just want to say that as Commander-in-Chief, I could not be prouder of the men and women of our military who carried out this humanitarian operation almost flawlessly. I'm very grateful to them and I know that those who were trapped on that mountain are extraordinarily grateful as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President also noted, however, that the situation is still dire for Iraqis that are &quot;subjected to ISIL's terror throughout the country,&quot; including minorities like Yezidis and Iraqi Christians, as well as Sunnis, Shia, and Kurds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We're going to be working with our international partners to provide humanitarian assistance to those who are suffering in northern Iraq wherever we have capabilities and we can carry out effective missions like the one we carried out on Mount Sinjar without committing combat troops on the ground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We obviously feel a great urge to provide some humanitarian relief to the situation and I've been very encouraged by the interest of our international partners in helping on these kinds of efforts as well. We will continue air strikes to protect our people and facilities in Iraq. We have increased the delivery of military assistance to Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting ISIL on the front lines. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, perhaps most importantly, we are urging Iraqis to come together to turn the tide against ISIL -- above all, by seizing the enormous opportunity of forming a new, inclusive government under the leadership of Prime Minister-designate Abadi. I had a chance to speak to Prime Minister-designate Abadi a few days ago, and he spoke about the need for the kind of inclusive government -- a government that speaks to all the people of Iraq -- that is needed right now. He still has a challenging task in putting a government together, but we are modestly hopeful that the Iraqi government situation is moving in the right direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to the situation in Ferguson, the President acknowledged that many Americans this week have been &quot;deeply disturbed&quot; by the images of police clashing with protestors -- adding that we should all &quot;take a step back, and think about how we're going to move forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This morning, I received a thorough update on the situation from Attorney General Eric Holder, who has been following it and been in communication with his team. I've already tasked the Department of Justice and the FBI to independently investigate the death of Michael Brown, along with local officials on the ground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Department of Justice is also consulting with local authorities about ways that they can maintain public safety without restricting the right of peaceful protest and while avoiding unnecessary escalation. I made clear to the Attorney General that we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened, and to see that justice is done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I also just spoke with Governor Jay Nixon of Missouri. I expressed my concern over the violent turn that events have taken on the ground, and underscored that now is the time for all of us to reflect on what's happened, and to find a way to come together going forward. He is going to be traveling to Ferguson. He is a good man and a fine governor, and I'm confident that, working together, he is going to be able to communicate his desire to make sure that justice is done and his desire to make sure that public safety is maintained in an appropriate way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, it's important to remember how this started. We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old. His family will never hold Michael in their arms again. And when something like this happens, the local authorities -- including the police -- have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death, and how they are protecting the people in their communities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, MO.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. - When an unarmed black teenager and a police officer crossed paths here last weekend  with fatal results, the incident cast a blinding spotlight on a small police department struggling for authority and relevance in a changing community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the shooting, the department has been criticized for how police have handled the response to the incident and for not disclosing key details, including the name of the officer involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department bears little demographic resemblance to the citizens of this St. Louis suburb, a mostly African American community whose suspicions of the law enforcement agency preceded Saturday afternoon's shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old who this week had been headed to technical college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the racial disparity between the public here and its protectors has come to define the violent aftermath of Brown's death, the department's problems stretch back years and include questions about its officers' training and racial sensitivity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The office of Missouri's attorney general concluded in an annual report last year that Ferguson police were twice as likely to arrest African Americans during traffic stops as they were whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And late last year, the state chapter of the NAACP filed a federal complaint against the St. Louis County police department, whose officers are now assisting Ferguson's force since the shooting, over racial disparities in traffic stops, arrests and other actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions between residents and the police have shaped the aftermath of Brown's death in unpredictable and alarming ways. Those include the nightly clashes between young residents, most of whom are African American, and a predominantly white police force dressed in full riot gear and armed with tear gas and rubber-coated bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early Wednesday morning, a St. Louis County police officer shot and critically wounded a man who pointed a gun at the officer, a police spokesman said. Police had responded to calls regarding four men armed with shotguns and wearing ski masks in St. Louis as well as calls about shots fired in the area. People fled the scene when police arrived, but one person pointed a handgun at an officer, who shot the man, spokesman Brian Schellman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials have provided little information about Brown's shooting and have withheld the name of the police officer involved, citing security reasons. The vacuum has been filled by social media, which has displayed in real time street confrontations between police and demonstrators, documenting the fraught interactions in images, videos and short dispatches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson acknowledged the problems facing his department and asked the community for help in restoring its trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, there has been this undertow that has bubbled to the surface,&quot; Jackson said at a news conference. &quot;It's our priority to address it and to fix what's been going wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis is among the most segregated metropolitan areas in the nation. Ferguson, one of the 91 municipalities in largely white St. Louis County, has seen its population shift in recent years. About two-thirds of the city's 21,100 residents are black. That's a significant increase from 2000, when blacks made up just over half of the population. White residents, who had accounted for 44 percent of the population, now make up just under 30 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the police force patrolling Ferguson has not changed along with the population. The police force has 53 members, and three of them are black. The city's mayor and police chief are white, as are most of the members of the Ferguson City Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been trying to increase the diversity of the department ever since I got here,&quot; Jackson said Wednesday. He pointed out that he had promoted two black superintendents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Race relations is a top priority right now,&quot; Jackson said. He said his force is working with the Department of Justice's community relations office to improve how police interact with the citizens. &quot;I've told them, 'Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.'&nbsp;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents have described Brown's death as a breaking point that finally pushed years of tension to the fore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People here are angry, frustrated,&quot; said Corey Crawford, 36. &quot;There needs to be justice. If you can find a single person in this community who trusts the police, that is like finding a four-leafed clover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been &quot;very hostile&quot; for years, said Anthony Ross, 26, who lives nearby. He called the relationship between residents and police nonexistent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody in this city has been a victim of DWB [driving while black],&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For at least a decade, there have been complaints about racial tensions between police and black communities in the St. Louis County area. Communities, some residents say, can have less-experienced, poorly-equipped police departments and highly uneven levels of protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, St. Louis County invited researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles to help study complaints that county police had engaged in racial profiling and to help them improve protocols for matters ranging from traffic stops to neighborhood monitoring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This came after a former lieutenant with the county police who had been accused of ordering officers to target black people at stores was fired. An investigation determined that he had made &quot;inappropriate racial references.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A St. Louis Post-Dispatch investigation in 2003 found that dozens of small police departments in the region suffered from poor training owing to a lack of funding, leading to inadequate investigations of complex crimes and an uneven use of force. The newspaper further found that this led to problematic officers moving easily between one city's force to another without punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As attention has shifted to the protests and nightly standoffs on Ferguson's streets, key details regarding the shooting remain unclear. Authorities have yet to say how many times Brown was shot or where he was struck. Earlier in the week, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said that Brown was shot multiple times but did not elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Wednesday, Jackson, Ferguson's police chief, would not say how many times Brown was shot. The only update regarding the confrontation came Wednesday, when Jackson said that the officer's &quot;face was swollen&quot; after the encounter, so he required medical treatment. Police have said that Brown was shot after a physical confrontation with the officer, including a struggle over the officer's gun, which witnesses have disputed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a separate news conference Wednesday, Robert P. McCulloch, the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, also declined to say how many times Brown was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to test the veracity and accuracy of anybody who comes to us with a statement and says they saw something,&quot; McCulloch said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said in an interview Wednesday that he was driving with his children to lunch Saturday when a sergeant called him about the shooting. Before even arriving at the scene, Jackson called county police to take over the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as protesters from the community and neighboring city flooded Ferguson's streets for both prayer vigils and tense standoffs, Ferguson again called on the county for help. Hundreds of officers from St. Louis County police, the city of St. Louis and the Missouri State Highway Patrol arrived to help deal with the looting that had broken out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In audio recordings released Wednesday by the hacking collective Anonymous, a voice identified as belonging to a county police dispatcher indicated that Ferguson police were unaware that one of their officers had been involved in Saturday's shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The female dispatcher noted that she had received two calls about an &quot;officer-related shooting&quot; on Canfield Drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We just got another call about an officer-involved shooting . . . there,&quot; she said. &quot;This came from the news, so [unintelligible] don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few seconds later, the dispatcher, apparently frustrated that the information appeared to be coming from news accounts, said she couldn't get confirmation from the police in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We just called Ferguson back again, and they don't know anything about it,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County police did not respond to a request for comment regarding the dispatch tape's veracity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anonymous became widely known for its cyberattacks on government Web sites and credit card companies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, MO.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. - When an unarmed black teenager and a police officer crossed paths here last weekend  with fatal results, the incident cast a blinding spotlight on a small police department struggling for authority and relevance in a changing community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the shooting, the department has been criticized for how police have handled the response to the incident and for not disclosing key details, including the name of the officer involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department bears little demographic resemblance to the citizens of this St. Louis suburb, a mostly African American community whose suspicions of the law enforcement agency preceded Saturday afternoon's shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old who this week had been headed to technical college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the racial disparity between the public here and its protectors has come to define the violent aftermath of Brown's death, the department's problems stretch back years and include questions about its officers' training and racial sensitivity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The office of Missouri's attorney general concluded in an annual report last year that Ferguson police were twice as likely to arrest African Americans during traffic stops as they were whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And late last year, the state chapter of the NAACP filed a federal complaint against the St. Louis County police department, whose officers are now assisting Ferguson's force since the shooting, over racial disparities in traffic stops, arrests and other actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions between residents and the police have shaped the aftermath of Brown's death in unpredictable and alarming ways. Those include the nightly clashes between young residents, most of whom are African American, and a predominantly white police force dressed in full riot gear and armed with tear gas and rubber-coated bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early Wednesday morning, a St. Louis County police officer shot and critically wounded a man who pointed a gun at the officer, a police spokesman said. Police had responded to calls regarding four men armed with shotguns and wearing ski masks in St. Louis as well as calls about shots fired in the area. People fled the scene when police arrived, but one person pointed a handgun at an officer, who shot the man, spokesman Brian Schellman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials have provided little information about Brown's shooting and have withheld the name of the police officer involved, citing security reasons. The vacuum has been filled by social media, which has displayed in real time street confrontations between police and demonstrators, documenting the fraught interactions in images, videos and short dispatches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson acknowledged the problems facing his department and asked the community for help in restoring its trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, there has been this undertow that has bubbled to the surface,&quot; Jackson said at a news conference. &quot;It's our priority to address it and to fix what's been going wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis is among the most segregated metropolitan areas in the nation. Ferguson, one of the 91 municipalities in largely white St. Louis County, has seen its population shift in recent years. About two-thirds of the city's 21,100 residents are black. That's a significant increase from 2000, when blacks made up just over half of the population. White residents, who had accounted for 44 percent of the population, now make up just under 30 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the police force patrolling Ferguson has not changed along with the population. The police force has 53 members, and three of them are black. The city's mayor and police chief are white, as are most of the members of the Ferguson City Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been trying to increase the diversity of the department ever since I got here,&quot; Jackson said Wednesday. He pointed out that he had promoted two black superintendents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Race relations is a top priority right now,&quot; Jackson said. He said his force is working with the Department of Justice's community relations office to improve how police interact with the citizens. &quot;I've told them, 'Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.'&nbsp;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents have described Brown's death as a breaking point that finally pushed years of tension to the fore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People here are angry, frustrated,&quot; said Corey Crawford, 36. &quot;There needs to be justice. If you can find a single person in this community who trusts the police, that is like finding a four-leafed clover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been &quot;very hostile&quot; for years, said Anthony Ross, 26, who lives nearby. He called the relationship between residents and police nonexistent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody in this city has been a victim of DWB [driving while black],&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For at least a decade, there have been complaints about racial tensions between police and black communities in the St. Louis County area. Communities, some residents say, can have less-experienced, poorly-equipped police departments and highly uneven levels of protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. - Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri moved Thursday to restore calm in this St. Louis suburb after the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer had led to several nights of unrest, which had been met by tear gas and rubber bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference, Nixon said the Missouri State Highway Patrol would direct the team providing security and crowd control during protests. The governor said the highway patrol would work with local law enforcement officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, United States President Barack Obama called on the police in Ferguson to be &quot;open and transparent&quot; as they investigate the shooting death of the teenager, and he urged calm in a city that has been rocked by violence in recent days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama did not specifically call on the police to release the name of the officer who shot 18-year-old Michael Brown on Saturday, a decision by the authorities that has helped fuel anger among the residents of Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters from his island vacation in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, Obama urged law enforcement and protesters to &quot;take a step back and think&quot; about their actions. He scolded the police in Ferguson for reports of excessive force by officers and of protesters being jailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Now's the time for healing. Now's the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president said he had just spoken to Nixon about his concern that the situation had taken &quot;a violent turn.&quot; He said he had urged Nixon to make sure public safety was maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief of Ferguson, Tom Jackson, said during a news conference that federal, state and local officials were meeting Thursday to discuss the police response to the protests, in part to determine if the actions of officers had exacerbated the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to talk about not only the tactics but the appearance&quot; of the officers, who have been equipped with riot gear, armoured vehicles and assault rifles during the demonstrations, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., however, said in a statement that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sent a conflicting message. He said that federal officials would provide &quot;assistance to local authorities in order to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri said that the police response to the protests had become part of the problem rather than a solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the demilitarization of the response will help a lot,&quot; she said, adding that the show of force by the authorities made it appear as if peaceful demonstrators in Ferguson had been behaving illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon made his comments after meeting with the St. Louis Metropolitan Clergy Coalition and other civic and faith leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been a fear to hear, not just about this action, but how this fits into a much larger and broader context into a deeper march to justice,&quot; the governor said. But he also said that people should be allowed to demonstrate as long as it is peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must make sure that justice prevails,&quot; Nixon said, assuring residents that the investigation into the shooting would seek to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama issued a written statement two days ago on Brown's shooting, promising that the Justice Department and the FBI would examine the circumstances of the death. Since then, the situation in the Midwest city has grown more violent, with clashes between police and protesters. Obama warned that people should not use what he called &quot;this tragedy&quot; as an opportunity for vandalism or looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he spoke more directly to the law enforcement authorities, saying that &quot;we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Thursday, a group identifying itself as Anonymous, the computer hacking collective, disclosed what it said was the name of the police officer who fatally shot Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing on Twitter, the group said it would publish additional information about the officer - including his photograph - if it did not receive a response from the St. Louis County Police Department, which is overseeing one of the investigations into the death of Brown. Brown was shot Saturday afternoon while walking from a convenience store with a friend. But the account was later taken down by Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said that the name released by Anonymous was incorrect, and the St. Louis County police said on Twitter that the name was &quot;not even an officer with St. Louis County or Ferguson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ferguson Police Department has declined to release the name of the officer, citing safety concerns for the officer and his family after threats were made against him and the department on social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said officials would discuss whether to release the name of the officer but that a decision had not yet been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're having some conversations about that today,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer in a suburb of St. Louis over the weekend has evoked a repeat of the turmoil that followed the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida two years ago. In both cases young African-American men just entering adulthood died violently under circumstances that fostered questions about whether they were targeted solely because of their race, and in both cases the killers justified their actions by claiming self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a pattern that has become depressingly familiar in African-American communities across the country and has stoked the anger and resentment against police. Authorities need to conduct a thorough investigation into what happened and make the results known as quickly as possible not only to hold those responsible to account but to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents in the future. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police initially claimed the incident began after 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was walking with a friend, engaged in a &quot;physical confrontation&quot; with an officer from the Ferguson, Mo., police department. They said a struggle ensued involving the officer's service weapon. Police said the officer was pushed back into his squad car and one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the car. The officer then got out of the car and fired several more shots at the teen, who was killed about 35 feet away from the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But so far police have offered no explanation for what sparked the alleged confrontation, nor of who fired the shot inside the car or why the officer fired so many shots at Mr. Brown after leaving his vehicle, or how a confrontation next to and inside a vehicle ended with a corpse a dozen yards away. Meanwhile, a witness who was walking with the victim has disputed the police account, saying the officer opened fire when Mr. Brown, who was said to have had his hands up, refused to move from the middle of the street to the sidewalk. An autopsy Sunday showed Mr. Brown was hit by multiple rounds from the officer's gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting has sparked days of solemn vigils and angry protests from black Ferguson residents. On Sunday hundreds of people faced off against officers wearing riot gear to press their complaint that people of color were being unfairly targeted by police because of their race, and a small number of demonstrators looted stores and shops in the area. Local residents described the unrest as a expression of long-standing frustrations over police routinely stopping young black men for trivial reasons and employing excessive force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are certainly enough questions surrounding Mr. Brown's death to warrant the U.S. Justice Department's decision Monday to open its own separate investigation into possible civil rights violations. Ferguson authorities have turned the local investigation over to the St. Louis County police department, none of whose officers were involved in the shooting. County police chief Jon Belmar said he could understand why the public might be skeptical about whether his department could conduct an impartial investigation of fellow police officers but pleaded for patience as it pursued what he called a very sensitive and complex case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr. Brown's parents have hired Benjamin Crump, the lawyer who represented Trayvon Martin's family, to advise them as the federal and local investigations proceed. Reflecting the outrage felt by African-Americans nationwide over a string of recent deaths of young black men at the hands of police, Mr. Crump has called the Brown shooting &quot;another senseless death of another person of color.&quot; Echoing that sentiment, NAACP President Cornell William Brooks, who arrived in Missouri after the shooting, said that &quot;the death of yet another African-American at the hands of those sworn to protect and serve the community where he lived is heartbreaking.&quot; Other civil rights leaders have warned that a thorough, timely and transparent investigation is the only way to restore black residents' faith in local law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no doubt the case has struck a raw nerve, or that anything short of holding those found to be responsible for this tragedy will just exacerbate the ill-feeling and mistrust of police in African-American communities. There is no justification for looting and lawless behavior in the aftermath of such incidents, but at the same time police must learn to conduct themselves in a way that gains the confidence and respect of those they are sworn to serve and that starts with a recognition that every young black man walking down the street isn't a potential criminal who deserves to be harassed, intimidated or even killed for no reason at all.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLAYTON, Mo. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLAYTON, Mo. -- Yet again, the protesters took to the sidewalks and streets, facing a row of police guarding the St. Louis County prosecutor's office. &quot;Hands up!&quot; they chanted, their arms aloft. &quot;Don't shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is how the boy died!&quot; Kendrick Strong, 42, hollered at police officers Tuesday morning. &quot;This is how the boy died! With his hands up in the air!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As St. Louis' predominantly black northern quarter has teetered toward chaos the past four days -- after police in the suburb of Ferguson killed an unarmed teen -- the chant has been one inescapable constant amid the worry and confusion and clamor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hands-up -- a sign of surrender and submission black men and boys here say they learn early on when dealing with police -- has been transformed into a different kind of weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're angry, throw your arms up,&quot; said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who traveled to St. Louis in the wake of the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. &quot;If you want justice, throw your arms up. Because that's the sign Michael was using. He had a surrender sign. That's the sign you have to deal with. Use the sign he last showed. We want answers why that last sign was not respected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was shot and killed by an officer Saturday, while Brown, according to witnesses, was running away with his hands up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police, an officer drove up next to Brown and attempted to get out of his patrol car. Brown pushed the officer back into the car and after an altercation over a weapon in the car, the officer and Brown exited the car, when the fatal shooting occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the days since the shooting, riot police have been sweeping the streets amid scenes of civil unrest. Stores have been looted, a gas station burned, a Catholic charity's window smashed. Teens have hurled rocks at cops. Officers have launched tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Brown's parents, has demanded that police identify the officer who shot Brown, but the Ferguson police chief declined to do so, citing death threats against the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama, noting the Justice Department is aiding local officials in investigating the shooting, on Tuesday said, &quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Mo., and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local and national black community organizations are deliberating their roles in how to respond to Brown's death. And everyone wonders when the convulsive nighttime violence that has turned Ferguson into an unpredictable &quot;war zone&quot; -- as some officers have put it -- will end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as &quot;Ferguson&quot; has transformed into an instantly recognizable shorthand -- a name now signifying an unsettled national conversation over race and policing -- the &quot;hands up, don't shoot&quot; chant has joined a long line of activist slogans that instantly crystallize the heart of a community's moral outrage: Hell no, we won't go. No justice, no peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators had already taken up the chant Monday when hundreds of demonstrators, many older, marched in front of the Ferguson Police Department, arms raised. About two-thirds of Ferguson's 21,000 residents are African-American, but police and city officials are predominantly white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black teens and 20-somethings who took to the streets in Ferguson on Monday night did the same, only their hands were raised to the lights of a police helicopter and the line of police vehicles -- with officers in front -- trying to keep them at bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the youths also used the hands-up sign as a tool for provocation, drifting toward the police with their arms up, as if daring for a response. They mixed the hands-up chant with a obscene anti-police chant. The police eventually drove them back with tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Clayton the following morning, the hands-up protest was deployed again to confront police officers, but with more peaceful intentions. For several black men who looked on as a line of demonstrators held up their hands, the symbol had powerful and even painful personal resonance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Sutton, 24, of St. Louis, recalled an incident when he was 18. He had gone to a mall with his little brother to pick out a prom suit, but ID-checkers at the entrance wouldn't let him in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sutton said that as he walked away with a cellphone to his ear, a police officer grabbed his hand; surprised, he yanked his arm away, and then was thrown to the ground, handcuffed and Tasered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That could have been me in '08,&quot; Sutton said of Brown's shooting. &quot;I wouldn't be here to tell this story. I wouldn't be here to protest.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">495 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nights of unrest have vied with calls for calm in a St Louis suburb where an unarmed black teenager was killed by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile the community is still pressing for answers about the weekend shooting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of residents packed two churches yesterday evening for community meetings about the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was confronted by a Ferguson officer while walking with a friend in the street near his grandmother's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People also gathered in the streets last night, shouting at police. Officers again fired tear gas into a crowd, according to reports. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One person was injured in a drive-by shooting, although it was not clear if the shooting was related to the protests. There were also reports that a St Louis County police officer shot and critically wounded a man who authorities said pulled a handgun on the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal shooting of Mr Brown has exposed deep racial and economic fault lines in the community. At one church gathering with dozens of clergy members and elected officials, Missouri governor Jay Nixon urged calm &quot;in the face of crisis&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We stand together tonight, reeling from what feels like an old wound torn open afresh,&quot; Mr Nixon said. &quot;A wound that hadn't quite healed right in the first place, and now the pain is just as searing as when the injury first occurred.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other church rally featured civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton, who earlier in the day pressed police to release the name of the police officer involved - but also pleaded for calm after a night of looting and vandalism and instances of police using tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The local authorities have put themselves in a position - hiding names and not being transparent - where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation,&quot; Mr Sharpton said at a news conference with Brown's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police initially planned to release the name of the officer, who is on administrative leave, yesterday. But they said death threats to its officers prompted them to withhold it. Computer hackers have also targeted the city's website and released details online about individual city employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson said: &quot;If we come out and say, 'It was this officer,' then he immediately becomes a target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're taking the threats seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white. The Ferguson force has 53 officers, three of whom are black. Mr Jackson said the city has had trouble recruiting and retaining black officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators have released few details about the deadly encounter, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer on a routine patrol asked Brown and another teen to get out of the street on Saturday afternoon. At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, according to the St Louis County Police Department, which is handling the investigation at the smaller city's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said there is no security or police video of the confrontation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St Louis streets tense after police shoot young man MOURNING: Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden. Photo: Getty Images By Nick O'Malley in Washington Three days after a young black man was shot dead by police, tension on the streets of St Louis, Missouri, remained high. Still, nobody seemed quite sure what happened. All that was certain was Michael Brown, 18, was unarmed when he was shot several times just after 2pm on Saturday in the suburb of Ferguson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St Louis County Police Department chief Jon Belmar said officers &quot;had an encounter&quot; with Mr Brown, during which the youth pushed an officer and reached for his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our understanding at this point in the investigation that there was a struggle over the officer's weapon. There was at least one shot fired in the car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Brown was found dead more than 10metres from the car and, according to his mother, was shot eight times. Piaget Crenshaw, a young local woman, told a local Fox station Mr Brown was walking with a friend, Dorin Johnson, to his grandmother's apartment when an officer in a car ordered them to get off the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a verbal altercation, the officer shot Mr Brown dead as Mr Johnson hid behind a car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Brown graduated from high school this year and was to start at a technical college on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the shooting, events followed a tragically familiar path. Soon the streets filled with protesters, some yelling &quot;kill the police&quot;. Fearing a riot, police flooded the streets with officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday night the riot broke out. A dozen or so businesses were vandalised or looted, two officers injured and 32 people arrested. On Monday the streets were calm but tension remained high, especially as an autopsy report was soon to be made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angered that the media appeared to select photos of young black men that made them look menacing, thousands posted dual photos of Mr Brown or themselves online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One post showed Mr Brown looking streetwise beside another of him looking comfortable in a classroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another typical post showed a photo of a young man throwing a gang sign beside another of him in military uniform reading to children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Brown's shooting had been compared to the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that case, the young black teenager was shot dead by George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer who believed the teenager, wearing a hooded sweatshirt, looked suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St Louis Post-Dispatch reported Mr Brown's family had retained Trayvon Martin's lawyer Benjamin Crump to represent them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting came as civil rights organisations prepared for protests in New York over the death of Eric Garner, 43, who died after police allegedly used an illegal chokehold on him while arresting him for selling single cigarettes on the street.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 13--OAK BLUFFS -- And now, the island waits for The Big Hug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, a conciliatory embrace between Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton -- between a current and perhaps a future president -- may be the main event tonight, when the powerful pair are scheduled to attend a party for Ann Jordan, wife of Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need for a squeeze arose from recent remarks by Clinton that could be viewed as critical of some aspects of the president's foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to The Associated Press, Clinton called Obama on Tuesday to tell him that the remarks, made during an interview with The Atlantic, were not an attempt to attack him or his leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like any two friends who have to deal with the public eye, she looks forward to hugging it out when they see each other (Wednesday) night,&quot; said Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill in a written statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the interview, Clinton -- Obama's secretary of state during his first term -- described a different approach she would take in places such as Syria and the Mideast. And she rebuked Obama's cautious approach to global crises, according to the Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So will it be a bear hug or an air hug? Or is it no cinch that there will even be a clinch? Serious squeeze fans can only wait and wonder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the calm before the hug, Obama headed over to Vineyard Golf Club in Edgartown Tuesday afternoon to golf while the golfing was good. Weather forecasts point to a washout on Wednesday, which might limit the president to puttering around his vacation home in Chilmark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Birdie-seeking pals on the swinging safari included Cyrus Walker, cousin of senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett; Dr. Eric Whitaker, a longtime friend of Obama from Chicago; and Ron Kirk, former trade ambassador.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the President also expressed his condolences to the family and community of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager who was shot to death over the weekend by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Tensions have been boiling in the suburban St. Louis city since the incident, sparking protests, riots, looting and arson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,&quot; Obama said, according to a White House statement. &quot;We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, a conciliatory embrace between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton -- between a current and perhaps a future president -- may be the main event tonight, when the powerful pair are scheduled to attend a party for Ann Jordan, wife of Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need for a squeeze arose from recent remarks by Clinton that could be viewed as critical of some aspects of the president's foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to The Associated Press, Clinton called Obama on Tuesday to tell him that the remarks, made during an interview with The Atlantic, were not an attempt to attack him or his leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like any two friends who have to deal with the public eye, she looks forward to hugging it out when they see each other (Wednesday) night,&quot; said Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill in a written statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the interview, Clinton -- Obama's secretary of state during his first term -- described a different approach she would take in places such as Syria and the Mideast. And she rebuked Obama's cautious approach to global crises, according to the Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So will it be a bear hug or an air hug? Or is it no cinch that there will even be a clinch? Serious squeeze fans can only wait and wonder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the calm before the hug, Obama headed over to Vineyard Golf Club in Edgartown Tuesday afternoon to golf while the golfing was good. Weather forecasts point to a washout on Wednesday, which might limit the president to puttering around his vacation home in Chilmark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Birdie-seeking pals on the swinging safari included Cyrus Walker, cousin of senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett; Dr. Eric Whitaker, a longtime friend of Obama from Chicago; and Ron Kirk, former trade ambassador.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the President also expressed his condolences to the family and community of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager who was shot to death over the weekend by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Tensions have been boiling in the suburban St. Louis city since the incident, sparking protests, riots, looting and arson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,&quot; Obama said, according to a White House statement. &quot;We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, MO. (AP) &amp;GT;&amp;GT; Nights of unrest have vied with calls for calm in a St. Louis suburb where an unarmed black teenager was killed by police, while the community is still pressing for answers about the weekend shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of residents packed two churches Tuesday evening for community meetings about the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was confronted by a Ferguson officer while walking with a friend in the street near his grandmother's home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People also gathered in the streets Tuesday night, shouting at police. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that police again fired tear gas into a crowd. One person was injured in a drive-by shooting, although it was not clear if the shooting was related to the protests. The Post-Dispatch also reported that a St. Louis County police officer shot and critically wounded a man who authorities said pulled a handgun on the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal shooting of Brown has exposed deep racial and economic fault lines in the community. At one church gathering with dozens of clergy members and elected officials, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon urged calm &quot;in the face of crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We stand together tonight, reeling from what feels like an old wound torn open afresh,&quot; Nixon said. &quot;A wound that hadn't quite healed right in the first place, and now the pain is just as searing as when the injury first occurred.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other church rally featured the Rev. Al Sharpton, who earlier in the day pressed police to release the name of the police officer involved   but also pleaded for calm after a night of looting and vandalism and instances of police using tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The local authorities have put themselves in a position   hiding names and not being transparent   where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation,&quot; Sharpton said at a news conference with Brown's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson police initially planned to release the name of the officer, who is on administrative leave, on Tuesday. But they said death threats to its officers prompted them to withhold it. Computer hackers have also targeted the city's website and released details online about individual city employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we come out and say, 'It was this officer,' then he immediately becomes a target,&quot; Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said. &quot;We're taking the threats seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white. The Ferguson police force has 53 officers, three of whom are black. Jackson said the city has had trouble recruiting and retaining black officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators have released few details about the deadly encounter, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer on a routine patrol asked Brown and another teen to get out of the street on Saturday afternoon. At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, according to the St. Louis County Police Department, which is handling the investigation at the smaller city's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred protesters rallied Tuesday morning in the county seat of Clayton, urging St. Louis County's prosecutor to file criminal charges against the Ferguson officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., said at the news conference to &quot;come together and do this right ... no violence.&quot; President Barack Obama also urged calm, saying people must comfort each other &quot;in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson's mayor and police chief were among the speakers at the meeting Nixon attended. Both were welcomed with polite applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum was intended as an alternative response after two nights of unrest in which crowds had burned stores, vandalized vehicles, assaulted reporters and taunted officers. Organizers shared plans for numerous nonviolent responses, such as a prayer walk planned to mark the one-week anniversary of Brown's death and assembling teams of greeters to welcome back students at the high school from which Brown recently graduated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fullest account of Brown's death so far has come from Dorian Johnson, who said he was walking home with Brown when they were approached by an officer in a squad car who ordered them to move to the sidewalk. Johnson told news crews that he and Brown kept walking and the officer then reversed his car &quot;to where it almost hit us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer, Johnson said, tried to open his door, but it &quot;ricocheted&quot; back. Johnson said the officer reached through the window, &quot;grabbed my friend around the neck&quot; and tried to pull him into the car. The officer then reportedly pulled out his weapon and said, &quot;'I'll shoot you,' or 'I'm going to shoot,'&quot; Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the officer opened fire, Brown was hit, said Johnson, who hid behind a car. Brown kept running, Johnson said. Johnson said the officer pursued Brown and fired again. When Brown felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down on the ground. The officer kept firing, Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said there is no security or police video of the confrontation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She called for calm, but demonstrations demanding the arrest and conviction of the police officer turned violent.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds driven out of one area by tear gas gathered outside a police station chanting &quot;Hands up, don't shoot&quot;.</SPAN></P>

A law signed this week prohibits direct contact between members of the public and big cats at travelling animal shows and fairs. Animal exhibitors would face fines for each violation. So-called &quot;tiger selfies&quot; have emerged as popular profile photos on online dating sites, with users looking to stand out by posting a photo of themselves with the dangerous predators. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. A St. Louis County police officer has reportedly shot and critically wounded a man who police say pointed a handgun at the officer early Wednesday in Ferguson, Mo., where the fatal shooting of an unarmed young black man by an officer has triggered demonstrations, street clashes and looting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman was also shot in the head and wounded during the area'a sporadic street demonstrations overnight, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told the Los Angeles Times. He also confirmed the separate officer-involved shooting, but said that incident was being handled by St. Louis County police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer-involved shooting, which occurred at 1 a.m. CDT, occurred near the site of protests against police in the shooting of Michael Brown, St. Louis County police told local media outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A county police spokesman couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers arrived at the scene after receiving a call reporting four to five armed men in the area, and reports of shots fired, county police spokesman Officer Brian Schellman told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An officer approached one of the men, who pulled a handgun on the officer, and the officer shot him, Schellman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unidentified man was taken to the hospital in critical condition, according to the Post-Dispatch. A gun was recovered at the scene, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the incident involving the woman, local media reported that she was shot in the head during a drive-by shooting near the Ferguson QuikTrip gas station that had been looted and burned over the weekend and which has become a gathering point for demonstrators this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was conscious after being shot and called 911 herself, Jackson said. He was not able to provide further details, saying that he hadn't been briefed yet. Police were reportedly seeking four to five men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial tensions have simmered since the Saturday shooting of Brown. Ferguson is a working-class suburb of 21,000, where two-thirds of residents are black but police and city officials are predominantly white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning, scores of demonstrators faced off with riot police in Ferguson, with some protesters leaving peacefully and others being forced away by tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The street demonstrations followed a packed church meeting Tuesday night in Ferguson, in which Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, who is white, told area residents and civic leaders he wanted an &quot;open, thorough and fair&quot; investigation into Michael Brown's death, also adding, &quot;in the face of crisis, we must keep calm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a father of two sons, I've prayed for the parents and loved ones of Michael Brown,&quot; Nixon said in his remarks. &quot;We stand together tonight, reeling from what feels like an old wound that has been torn open afresh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon spoke at a second packed community forum and called for reconciliation and healing &quot;while remaining uncompromising in our expectation that justice must not simply be pursued, but in fact achieved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father of the young man who was killed, Michael Brown Sr., said: &quot;I need all of us to come together and do it right, the right way, so we can get something done about this. No violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. The police chief here on Wednesday offered some details of the shooting death of an 18-year-old African-American man by one of his officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief, Thomas Jackson, said that minutes before the shooting on Saturday, the officer and the young man, Michael Brown, had engaged in a violent confrontation, in which the officer was hit in the face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The side of his face is swollen,&quot; Jackson said at a news conference, adding that the officer, who has been put on administrative leave, was treated at a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson has not released the name of the officer, citing fears for his safety and that of his family. The police say Brown was shot after he assaulted the officer and tried to take his gun - an account disputed by a witness, a friend of Brown's who said his hands were raised when the last of several shots were fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI has opened a civil rights inquiry into the shooting, and the case is being investigated by the St. Louis County Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The selective release of information about the shooting, especially the anonymity granted the officer, has stoked frustrations in this largely African-American community north of St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, the St. Louis County medical examiner's office said that it would take two to three weeks to complete the autopsy of Brown, including a toxicology report, which is standard procedure in such deaths, said Suzanne McCune, a forensic administrator at the office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCune said that a preliminary autopsy was completed Monday and that Brown's body had been released to his family. McCune said the police department would decide whether to approve the release of the report once it is complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin L. Crump, a lawyer representing the Brown family, said that arrangements were being made for a private autopsy to be performed in the next week or so. &quot;The family wants an autopsy done by somebody who is objective and who does not have a relationship with the Ferguson police,&quot; Crump said. ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a third night of protests in Ferguson in which the police fired tear gas at protesters, the city's mayor and the City Council posted a letter Wednesday on the city website asking protesters to limit their demonstrations to daylight hours. A police spokesman said the request did not amount to a curfew.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police spokesman said Wednesday that a man who was fatally shot by two officers in South Los Angeles Monday night during a struggle had attempted to remove a gun from an officer s holster, a preliminary account that conflicts with statements made by the man s family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members told KTLA (Channel 5) on Tuesday that the 25-year-old man, whom they identified as Ezell Ford, was complying with Los Angeles Police Department officers  orders when he was shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said Wednesday that two veteran officers from the Newtown Division, who work gang detail, were driving their patrol car in the area of 65th Street and Broadway when they saw the man walking on a sidewalk, stopped their car and exited to talk to him. As the officers approached and made eye contact with the man, he continued to walk  making several suspicious movements, which include an apparent attempt to conceal his hands,  Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the officers attempted to stop him at some point, the man spun around, grabbed one of the officers and both the man and the officer fell down to the ground, Smith said. There was then a struggle with the  suspect on top of our officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We got two officers, one involved in a fight underneath the suspect   the suspect was on top of him,  Smith said.  It appears the suspect was attempting to pull a gun out of the holster. The partner shoots the officer. The officer underneath pulls his backup weapon while holding on to his primary weapon and shoots the suspect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all of the police department s patrol cars are equipped yet with video cameras and this particular car was not equipped, Smith said. Although a pilot program is underway in the Central Division in which officers are equipped with cameras on their bodies, nothing like that exists in the Newton Division, he said. Both officers were assigned home duty until the chief can made a decision on their status, which is expected to happen today, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tritobia Ford, who identified herself as the man s mother, told KTLA Tuesday that her son was lying on the ground, complying with the officers  commands, when he was shot three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My heart is so heavy,  she said.  My son was a good kid. He didn t deserve to die the way he did. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man who identified himself only as a cousin told the TV station there was no reason for the  excessive force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications,  the man said.  Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division knows that   that this child has mental problems. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earl Ofari Hutchinson of the Los Angeles Urban Roundtable, who along with other civil rights leaders has called for a meeting with Chief Charlie Beck over the matter, said he wants an investigation that is  swift, speedy, fair and impartial and most importantly transparent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Typically, these investigations drag on weeks and weeks and months on months,  Hutchinson said.  We are not interested in that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., a man killed by a police offer s chokehold after allegedly selling black market cigarettes in New York and the beating of Marlene Pinnock by a CHP officer in Los Angeles   in which all the victims were black    there has to be a sense of urgency,  he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A protest organized by those concerned about the shooting is slated for 3 p.m. Sunday at Police Department headquarters at 100 W. First St., according to a Facebook page .</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 people marched to the St Louis County courthouse yesterday in protest against the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager, but the demonstration remained peaceful after two previous days of violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters called for justice in the death of Michael Brown (18), shot to death in the back of a police car on Saturday, an end to what they say is harassment of blacks by the mostly white police force in Ferguson and the jailing of the officer who shot Mr Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson said police were determined to keep a lid on tensions. Authorities had been expected to release the name of the officer involved in the shooting, but the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">St</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> Louis Post-Dispatch</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, citing police, said yesterday the name would not be released. His race has not been revealed either.  'Hands up, don't shoot' The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the case. St Louis County is also investigating the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd in front of the St Louis County Courthouse in nearby Clayton yesterday chanted &quot;hands up, don't shoot&quot; - a reference to reports that Brown appeared to have been shot while holding his hands up in surrender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've consistently had a problem,&quot; said St Louis attorney Jerryl Christmas, who helped lead the protest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lack of diversity all the way up from the local police to the prosecutor's office into the judiciary.&quot;  Gun struggle Police said Brown was shot in a struggle with a gun in the police car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The street in the low-income, mostly black neighbourhood where Brown was killed was surrounded by memorials of candles and flowers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police, they always look at us with a certain disdain,&quot; said resident Christopher Phillips (33). &quot;So there are a lot of people with an 'F the police' mentality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said the neighbourhood had a lot of crime but there were no race problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Brown's family speaking on CNN yesterday, said the Justice Department needed to take over the investigation completely, and not rely on St Louis County police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 50 people have been arrested in protests following Brown's death.  - (Reuters)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- Protests in the St. Louis suburb rocked by racial unrest since a white police officer shot an unarmed black teenager to death turned violent Wednesday night, with people lobbing Molotov cocktails at police who responded with smoke bombs and tear gas to disperse the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who has been the public face of the city torn by Saturday's death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, told reporters earlier in the day that the St. Louis County investigation of the shooting could take weeks to complete. In the meantime, he said, his department welcomes Justice Department training on racial relations in the suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black while all but three of the police force's 53 officers are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, an undertow (of racial unrest) has bubbled to the surface,&quot; said Jackson. &quot;Race relations is the top priority right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Jackson said he wanted to mend fences with the community, protesters were on the streets of Ferguson again Wednesday, facing heavily armed police who at time trained weapons on them from an armored truck. Two reporters said they were detained by police while working at a McDonald's in the area. The situation became more tense after nightfall, with police ordering people to go home and then using smoke bombs and later tear gas after some people threw Molotov cocktails and other things at them. Journalists who witnessed the events included an Associated Press photographer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said he had no immediate information about the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post said they were handcuffed and put into a police van after officers came in to quickly clear the fast-food restaurant where they were doing some work. The Post reported that Lowery said he was slammed against a soda machine and plastic cuffs were put on his wrists. The reporters were subsequently released without any charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin D. Baron, the Post's executive editor, issued a statement saying &quot;there was absolutely no justification&quot; for Lowery's arrest and said the organization was appalled by the officers' conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson did not immediately return a cellphone message Wednesday night from the AP seeking comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. In their initial news conference about the shooting, police didn't specify whether Brown was the person who scuffled with the officer in the car and have refused to clarify their account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said Wednesday that the officer involved sustained swelling facial injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it &quot;ricocheted&quot; back, apparently upsetting the officer. Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some protesters Wednesday raised their arms above their heads as they faced the police. Others held signs asking for answers about Brown's death. The most popular chant has been, &quot;Hands up! Don't shoot!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's body remained on the street for hours -- a span Jackson deemed &quot;uncomfortable&quot; but justified, given that &quot;you only get one chance at that crime scene&quot; to process it correctly. Jackson said authorities also were concerned about gunfire they could hear in a nearby building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the shooting's aftermath, the notorious hacking collective Anonymous has taken credit for burrowing into the city website and shutting it down for much of the day Monday. The group also released what it said were audio experts from St. Louis County dispatch on the day Brown was killed. Police declined to comment on the recordings Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. -- The chief of police here said Tuesday that he had reconsidered his decision to release the name of the police officer involved in the fatal shooting of an unarmed African-American teenager and would not do so because of concerns about the officer's safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ferguson Police Department had said it would release the officer's name by noon on Tuesday, but then it reversed itself after it said that threats had been made on social media against the officer and the city's police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The value of releasing the name is far outweighed by the risk of harm to the officer and his family,'' the police chief, Thomas Jackson, said in announcing a decision that was quickly criticized. The officer has been placed on administrative leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change came amid another day of protests in the St. Louis suburbs where the teenager, Michael Brown, 18, was shot several times on Saturday by an officer as he and a friend walked from a convenience store. The circumstances remain in dispute. The police say Mr. Brown hit the officer and tried to steal his gun; Mr. Brown's family and friends deny that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The F.B.I. has opened a civil rights inquiry into the shooting, and the case is being investigated by the St. Louis County Police. The results of an autopsy on Mr. Brown have not been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests have at times turned violent: Stores have been looted, and at least one business was set on fire. The police have made more than 40 arrests since Sunday and fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a peaceful protest march on Tuesday to the St. Louis County prosecutor's office in Clayton, Mo., the seat of St. Louis County, demonstrators chanted ''Don't shoot!'' and raised their hands over their heads -- the pose they say Mr. Brown was in when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration barred aircraft from flying below 3,000 feet over Ferguson. The county police department had asked the agency to issue the ban on Monday after its helicopters were shot at ''a couple of different times,'' Officer Brian Schellman, a department spokesman, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama, in his first comments about the shooting, called the death of Mr. Brown heartbreaking but urged residents to remain calm. ''I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions,'' the president said in a statement on Tuesday, ''but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Mo., and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview on Tuesday with MSNBC, Dorian Johnson, a friend of Mr. Brown's, gave a description of the shooting. He said that he and Mr. Brown had been walking in the street when an officer drove up and told them to get onto the sidewalk. The two stayed in the street after telling the officer that they were close to Mr. Johnson's house. The officer, who had passed them, then backed up, almost hitting them in doing so. He then tried to open his door, which hit Mr. Brown, and when the door bounced shut, the officer reached out and grabbed Mr. Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mike was trying to get away from being choked,'' Mr. Johnson told MSNBC. At that point, he said, the officer pulled a gun and fired, striking Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown ''did not reach for the officer's weapon at all,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Johnson said that he and Mr. Brown began to run, and while he ducked behind a car, Mr. Brown kept going. After Mr. Brown was shot a second time, Mr. Johnson said, he turned to face the officer with his hands up, the officer fired several more shots, and Mr. Brown fell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing the Brown family, said Tuesday that Mr. Johnson had yet to be called in for questioning by the police and wanted to speak only to federal authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He does not trust the local law enforcement community,'' Mr. Crump said. ''How could he? He saw his friend executed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Crump, who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager who was shot and killed by a neighborhood-watch volunteer in Florida in 2012, criticized the Ferguson police chief's decision not to reveal the name of the officer who killed Mr. Brown. He said it only deepened the mistrust among blacks in the city, which is about two-thirds African-American but has a police force that is predominately white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Jackson said a provision of state law allowed police departments to withhold an officer's name if there were concerns about personal safety. Normally, a department has 72 hours to disclose a name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rash of threats on social media, Chief Jackson said, led to his decision. He said he had also ordered his officers to ride two to a car because rocks were being thrown at patrol cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, at a news conference on Tuesday in St. Louis with the Brown family, called for an end to the violence in Ferguson. ''Some of us are making the story about how mad we are,'' he said. ''To become violent in Michael Brown's name is to betray the gentle giant that he was.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown Sr., the victim's father, echoed that sentiment. ''I need justice for my son,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, a crowd gathered outside a church where members of the Brown family appeared with Mr. Sharpton. Many people urged calm, reminding one another that television cameras were present; some people made sure others did not spill into the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Stay on the sidewalks,'' one man said. ''The whole world is watching.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Tyler Atkins heard about the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, 18, an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Mo., he posted on Twitter a picture of himself in a tuxedo, with a saxophone around his neck, next to a photograph of himself dressed in a black T-shirt with a blue bandanna tied around his head and his finger pointed at the camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like hundreds of young African-Americans, he placed his pictures under the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown, protesting Mr. Brown's killing by a police officer and the way young black men are depicted in the news media. He said that Mr. Brown's identity was distorted and filtered through negative stereotypes, and that the same would have been done to him with the bandanna image if he found himself the victim of a similar event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first picture was taken after a jazz concert at the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Houston, where Mr. Atkins, a senior, studies music. The other was taken during a recording for a rap video he made with friends for a school math project. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Had the media gained ahold of this picture, I feel it would be used to portray that I was in a gang, which is not true at all,'' Mr. Atkins, 17, wrote in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speed with which the shooting of Mr. Brown has resonated on social media has helped propel and transform a local shooting into a national cause, as African-American commenters draw attention to continued episodes of violence directed at African-Americans and the media portrayals of young black men. ''This affects me deeply because the stories of Mike Brown, Renisha McBride, Trayvon Martin, Sean Bell, Amadou Diallo and many more could have been me,'' Mr. Atkins wrote, referring to the shooting deaths of blacks, some at the hands of police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, President Obama issued a statement calling the shooting ''heartbreaking'' and urging Americans to remember Mr. Brown ''through reflection and understanding.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said, ''I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions,'' adding, ''We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brittney Gault, 28, a student at DePaul University, said the #IfTheyGunnedMeDown campaign gained popularity because of the strength of black Twitter users collectively known as ''Black Twitter.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They are really a media response team,'' Ms. Gault said. ''Everybody is tapped into Black Twitter.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the social media chatter and anguish have become part of a complicated sea of viral words and images -- a picture Tuesday of police officers in combat gear pointing military-style rifles at a young black man in jeans and a blue T-shirt was one of them -- that have created a new and charged environment for social activism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to data from the Pew Research Internet Project, 40 percent of African-Americans ages 18 to 29 use Twitter, compared with 28 percent of whites of the same age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the #IfTheyGunnedMeDown campaign began, the phrase has been used on Twitter more than 168,000 times. Commenters on Twitter are also hoping to organize a series of vigils called the National Moment of Silence, which is meant to commemorate victims like Mr. Brown. The St. Louis County N.A.A.C.P. urged people on Twitter to use the hashtags #MikeBrown and #blacklifematters ''so that your posts can be seen nationally.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local authorities in Ferguson are less enthusiastic about social media's role, blaming it for inciting looting and violence following after the events. ''They have the ability to understand where they're all going to be, and they can basically plan where they want to go next,'' said Jon Belmar, the St. Louis County police chief. ''So it's a really efficient way to communicate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local officials have also declined to release the name of the officer who shot Mr. Brown, citing concerns about the officer's safety because of threats on social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The image of Mr. Brown that spurred the campaign on Twitter showed him with the fingers of his right hand extended in what some considered a peace sign, but which others called a gang sign. A spokeswoman for NBC News, one of the outlets that published the photograph online, said it was taken from Mr. Brown's personal Facebook page, where it was his profile picture.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a subsequent article about Mr. Brown's killing, the network used a different photograph of him that showed him wearing headphones and gazing at the camera.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tosan Tutse-Tonwe, 32, a blogger, consultant and co-founder of a nonprofit group called Act 4 Accountability, said photographs remove context from a situation, particularly in the wake of negative stereotypes about black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Tutse-Tonwe posted a photograph of himself wearing a T-shirt from his group and another with a black male friend who is flashing peace signs. Mr. Tutse-Tonwe said he chose to post the photograph with his friend after the image of Mr. Brown making the same hand gesture was circulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mike was throwing up a peace sign and people thought it was a gang sign? You've got to be kidding me,'' Mr. Tutse-Tonwe said. ''People make these leaps and there's no basis in them and they go unchecked.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Connally, 24, a student studying computer science at University of Texas at Arlington, agreed. ''They're portrayed as if they deserved it, cop versus robbers, good guys versus bad guys,'' he said. The Twitter engagement is part of broader efforts to use social media as a tool for education and engagement, particularly among the young. Few things have been more of a spur to passionate campaigns on Twitter and other social media than some of the racially charged killings of young blacks in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, when The Associated Press published a Twitter message announcing that Theodore P. Wafer had been found guilty of second-degree murder for killing Ms. McBride, Twitter users reacted swiftly, criticizing the post that described Mr. Wafer as a ''suburban Detroit homeowner'' and Ms. McBride as a ''woman who showed up drunk on porch.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, Twitter users posted African-American history images, including one featuring a slave ship with the headline, ''Families board wrong ship, end up in wrong place.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yemisi Miller-Tonnet, 19, a student at Spelman College in Atlanta, said social media movements should be taken seriously. ''Hashtag activism is activism,'' Ms. Miller-Tonnet said. ''We might be tweeting from a couch, but we're also getting up and doing the work that needs to be done.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police spokesman said Wednesday that a man who was fatally shot by two officers in South Los Angeles Monday night during a struggle had attempted to remove a gun from an officer s holster, a preliminary account that conflicts with statements made by the man s family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members told KTLA (Channel 5) on Tuesday that the 25-year-old man, whom they identified as Ezell Ford, was complying with Los Angeles Police Department officers  orders when he was shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said Wednesday that two veteran officers from the Newtown Division, who work gang detail, were driving their patrol car in the area of 65th Street and Broadway when they saw the man walking on a sidewalk, stopped their car and exited to talk to him. As the officers approached and made eye contact with the man, he continued to walk  making several suspicious movements, which include an apparent attempt to conceal his hands,  Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the officers attempted to stop him at some point, the man spun around, grabbed one of the officers and both the man and the officer fell down to the ground, Smith said. There was then a struggle with the  suspect on top of our officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We got two officers, one involved in a fight underneath the suspect   the suspect was on top of him,  Smith said.  It appears the suspect was attempting to pull a gun out of the holster. The partner shoots the officer. The officer underneath pulls his backup weapon while holding on to his primary weapon and shoots the suspect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all of the police department s patrol cars are equipped yet with video cameras and this particular car was not equipped, Smith said. Although a pilot program is underway in the Central Division in which officers are equipped with cameras on their bodies, nothing like that exists in the Newton Division, he said. Both officers were assigned home duty until the chief can made a decision on their status, which is expected to happen today, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tritobia Ford, who identified herself as the man s mother, told KTLA Tuesday that her son was lying on the ground, complying with the officers  commands, when he was shot three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My heart is so heavy,  she said.  My son was a good kid. He didn t deserve to die the way he did. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man who identified himself only as a cousin told the TV station there was no reason for the  excessive force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications,  the man said.  Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division knows that   that this child has mental problems. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earl Ofari Hutchinson of the Los Angeles Urban Roundtable, who along with other civil rights leaders has called for a meeting with Chief Charlie Beck over the matter, said he wants an investigation that is  swift, speedy, fair and impartial and most importantly transparent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Typically, these investigations drag on weeks and weeks and months on months,  Hutchinson said.  We are not interested in that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., a man killed by a police offer s chokehold after allegedly selling black market cigarettes in New York and the beating of Marlene Pinnock by a CHP officer in Los Angeles   in which all the victims were black    there has to be a sense of urgency,  he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A protest organized by those concerned about the shooting is slated for 3 p.m. Sunday at Police Department headquarters at 100 W. First St., according to a Facebook page .</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. - President Barack Obama called the police shooting death of an unarmed black teenager a tragedy and called Tuesday for thoughtful response after two nights of violent protests, looting, arrests and tear gas in a St. Louis suburb. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He promised a full U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the case, which has provoked outrage in the largely African-American town of Ferguson, where police have not released the shooter's name, citing security concerns and death threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but ... I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,&quot; Mr. Obama said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and family of 18-year-old Michael Brown planned a peaceful church vigil for Tuesday night, and his father pleaded for an end to the violence that has followed the incident, while activists demanded that authorities release the name of the officer involved. Standing with supporters, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, Michael Brown Sr. said he wanted justice for his son but wanted it &quot;the right way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way,&quot; said Mr. Brown, who wore a T-shirt showing his son's baby picture. &quot;No violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activists speaking to reporters in downtown St. Louis also called for federal authorities to take over the investigation after two nights of demonstrations and unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Ferguson had initially said they would release the officer's name Tuesday, but changed the plan, citing fears of retaliation, according to media reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sharpton, a New York-based civil rights leader, also called for peaceful protest in the wake of looting and more than 50 arrests since the shooting. Mr. Sharpton's National Action Network will pay for Mr. Brown's funeral. &quot;To become violent in Michael Brown's name is to betray the gentle giant that he was,&quot; Mr. Sharpton said of the 6-foot-4 Mr. Brown, who had planned to start college this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A demonstration was planned at a Ferguson-area church Tuesday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown was shot to death in the back of a police car Saturday, police said. The race of the officer, a six-year veteran who is now on administrative leave, has not been revealed. The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the racially charged case, and St. Louis County also is investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Mr. Brown was shot in a struggle with a gun in the police car but have not said why Mr. Brown was in the car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a witness to the shooting interviewed on local media has said Mr. Brown had been putting his hands up to surrender when he was killed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. - Nights of unrest have vied with calls for calm in a St. Louis suburb where an unarmed black teenager was killed by police, while the community is still pressing for answers about the weekend shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of residents packed two churches Tuesday evening for community meetings about the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was confronted by a Ferguson officer while walking with a friend in the street near his grandmother's home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People also gathered in the streets Tuesday night, shouting at police. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that police again fired tear gas into a crowd. One person was injured in a drive-by shooting, although it was not clear if the shooting was related to the protests. The Post-Dispatch also reported that a St. Louis County police officer shot and critically wounded a man who authorities said pulled a handgun on the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal shooting of Mr. Brown has exposed deep racial and economic fault lines in the community. At one church gathering with dozens of clergy members and elected officials, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon urged calm &quot;in the face of crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We stand together tonight, reeling from what feels like an old wound torn open afresh,&quot; Mr. Nixon said. &quot;A wound that hadn't quite healed right in the first place, and now the pain is just as searing as when the injury first occurred.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other church rally featured the Rev. Al Sharpton, who earlier in the day pressed police to release the name of the police officer involved - but also pleaded for calm after a night of looting and vandalism and instances of police using tear gas. ROBIN WILLIAMS DETAILS RELEASED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN RAFAEL, Calif. - Although police have now revealed how Robin Williams committed suicide, the Oscar-winning actor's fans, friends and even family continue to struggle to understand why someone who spread so much joy throughout the world could find so little in his own life that he decided to stop living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Williams, who made no secret of his decades-long struggles with depression and substance abuse, killed himself by fashioning a noose out of a belt and hanging himself, authorities said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The frenetic funnyman who starred in such films as &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire,&quot; ''Good Will Hunting&quot; and &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam,&quot; had announced only last month that he was re-entering a 12-step program to get his life back on track after months of nonstop work. His publicist confirmed after he died that he had been suffering in recent weeks from a serious case of depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, even family members were caught off-guard when his body was found in his San Francisco Bay Area home Monday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll never, ever understand how he could be loved so deeply and not find it in his heart to stay,&quot; his 25-year-old daughter, Zelda Williams, said in a poignant statement released Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marin County Sheriff's Lt. Keith Boyd said Mr. Williams was last seen alive by his wife, Susan Schneider, who went to bed around 10 p.m. Sunday. She awoke the next morning and left the couple's Tiburon home, thinking he was asleep somewhere else in the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he didn't answer a knock on the door a short time later, his personal assistant found him dead in a bedroom. A pocketknife was nearby and Mr. Williams also had superficial cuts on his wrists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt. Boyd said all evidence indicates the actor committed suicide by hanging himself. A final ruling will be announced after toxicology reports and interviews with witnesses are complete. RETAIL SALES FLAT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Retail sales were essentially flat in July, providing evidence that consumers have yet to shed their doubts about the economy despite recent job gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commerce Department said today that seasonally adjusted retail sales were unchanged in July compared with the prior month. Total sales rose a statistically insignificant $161 million from $439.6 billion in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spending dipped at auto dealers and department stores last month. The losses were offset by gains at grocery stores, gasoline stations, restaurants, clothiers and building material stores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures suggest that Americans are hesitant to spend, which could limit growth for the economy. Retail sales are closely watched because consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police spokesman said Wednesday that a man who was fatally shot by two officers in South Los Angeles Monday night during a struggle had attempted to remove a gun from an officer s holster, a preliminary account that conflicts with statements made by the man s family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members told KTLA (Channel 5) on Tuesday that the 25-year-old man, whom they identified as Ezell Ford, was complying with Los Angeles Police Department officers  orders when he was shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said Wednesday that two veteran officers from the Newtown Division, who work gang detail, were driving their patrol car in the area of 65th Street and Broadway when they saw the man walking on a sidewalk, stopped their car and exited to talk to him. As the officers approached and made eye contact with the man, he continued to walk  making several suspicious movements, which include an apparent attempt to conceal his hands,  Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the officers attempted to stop him at some point, the man spun around, grabbed one of the officers and both the man and the officer fell down to the ground, Smith said. There was then a struggle with the  suspect on top of our officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We got two officers, one involved in a fight underneath the suspect   the suspect was on top of him,  Smith said.  It appears the suspect was attempting to pull a gun out of the holster. The partner shoots the officer. The officer underneath pulls his backup weapon while holding on to his primary weapon and shoots the suspect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all of the police department s patrol cars are equipped yet with video cameras and this particular car was not equipped, Smith said. Although a pilot program is underway in the Central Division in which officers are equipped with cameras on their bodies, nothing like that exists in the Newton Division, he said. Both officers were assigned home duty until the chief can made a decision on their status, which is expected to happen today, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tritobia Ford, who identified herself as the man s mother, told KTLA Tuesday that her son was lying on the ground, complying with the officers  commands, when he was shot three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My heart is so heavy,  she said.  My son was a good kid. He didn t deserve to die the way he did. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man who identified himself only as a cousin told the TV station there was no reason for the  excessive force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications,  the man said.  Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division knows that   that this child has mental problems. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earl Ofari Hutchinson of the Los Angeles Urban Roundtable, who along with other civil rights leaders has called for a meeting with Chief Charlie Beck over the matter, said he wants an investigation that is  swift, speedy, fair and impartial and most importantly transparent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Typically, these investigations drag on weeks and weeks and months on months,  Hutchinson said.  We are not interested in that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., a man killed by a police offer s chokehold after allegedly selling black market cigarettes in New York and the beating of Marlene Pinnock by a CHP officer in Los Angeles   in which all the victims were black    there has to be a sense of urgency,  he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A protest organized by those concerned about the shooting is slated for 3 p.m. Sunday at Police Department headquarters at 100 W. First St., according to a Facebook page .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FERGUSON, MO. - The Rev. Al Sharpton pressed police Tuesday to release the name of the officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager in suburban St. Louis, and he pleaded for calm after two nights of violent protests over the young man's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police said death threats prompted them to withhold the name of the officer, who was placed on administrative leave after fatally shooting 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, where the incident has stoked racial tension, rallies and a night of looting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investigators have released few details, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Brown and another teen to get out of the street. At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also echoed pleas for peaceful protests by the NAACP and Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., who told the crowd: &quot;I need all of us to come together and do this right. ... No violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOARD APPROVES BULLET TRAIN TRACK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LOS ANGELES - Federal officials on Tuesday cleared the way for construction of a major segment of the California bullet train project: 114 miles of track from Fresno to Bakersfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After months of reviewing the proposed route and related environmental studies, the Surface Transportation Board conditionally approved the longest section of the Central Valley alignment, exempting it from further board oversight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is the final clearance for construction,&quot; said Lisa Marie Alley, a spokeswoman for the California High Speed Rail Authority. &quot;There is nothing else the Surface Transportation Board needs to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Fresno-to-Bakersfield section is part of a $68 billion proposal to build a 500-mile high-speed rail system between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Work is getting underway on a 29-mile section from Madera to Fresno.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDICTMENTS TARGET STOLEN PHONES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Minnesota family directed thieves to steal tens of thousands of smartphones across the country and then sold them to buyers in the black markets of the Middle East and China, federal authorities said Tuesday following the indictments of 20 people involved in the organized crime ring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Authorities say that the sophisticated &quot;Mustafa Organization&quot; used runners to fly across the country to steal phones outright or to buy them from retailers with false identities under bogus contracts. The phones would then be resold overseas under the cover of the wireless phone stores the family owned, federal authorities say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Authorities estimate that the family made upward of $4 million selling stolen phones over the past eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOTING RESUMES AFTER HAWAII STORM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A primary election in Hawaii that had threatened to extend weeks beyond last Saturday's balloting will conclude Friday when voters affected by Tropical Storm Iselle cast the remaining ballots that will determine the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appointed incumbent Sen. Brian Schatz held a lead of 1,635 votes, out of 230,000 cast, over challenger and U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa when ballots from all but two precincts were tallied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Voting in the two precincts in the Puna area of the Big Island had been postponed because of power outages and blocked roads caused by Iselle, which came ashore early Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOARD REAPPOINTS CHIEF OF L.A. POLICE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck was reappointed Tuesday to a second five-year term despite concerns about the LAPD's disciplinary policies and openness with information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Police Commission voted 4-1 in favor of Beck's reappointment, with veteran commissioner Robert Saltzman casting the lone dissenting vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Steve Soboroff praised Beck for falling crime numbers in the nation's second-largest city, though he also noted the commission's inspector general will be investigating reports of crimes that were improperly classified and lowered some statistics on violent offenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mayor Eric Garcetti supported Beck in his efforts to be reappointed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON o The U.S. Justice Department has intervened in cases involving more than two dozen local or state law enforcement departments over the last 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent intervention is coming in the fatal police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson on Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1997, 21 police departments - ranging from East Haven, Conn., to Los Angeles - have signed consent agreements with the Justice Department to improve procedures and policies. They often have involved use of force or relationships with minority communities, according to Samuel Walker, a national authority on civil liberties, policing and criminal justice policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all Justice Department involvement goes as far as consent decrees, and the department does not announce all its investigative activities, particularly if it investigates and closes without further action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consent agreements or investigations reached between the Justice Department and police forces usually came after broad allegations of police misconduct or, in a few cases, where specific instances spark broader action against a police force with a history of complaints against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department involvement in the Ferguson case has so far been what Attorney General Eric Holder describes as supplementary to local law enforcement investigations of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis, and two other members of Congress on Monday called for a broader investigation than the parallel track laid by Holder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concurrent investigation &quot;may be insufficient for two reasons,&quot; Clay wrote Holder, in a letter co-signed by Reps. John Conyers, D-Mich., and Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio. &quot;First, the St. Louis County Police Department may not be the most objective or credible body to investigate civil rights matters involving law enforcement given evidence of racial profiling by that department in the recent past, which Congressman Clay had asked the Department of Justice to investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Second, only the federal government has the resources, the experience, and the full independence to give this case the close scrutiny that the citizens of Ferguson and the greater St. Louis area deserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Missouri State Conference of the NAACP in November 2013 filed a federal civil rights complaint alleging that St. Louis County police officers racially profiled blacks in and around stores in south St. Louis County and that racism is rampant in the department's hiring, firing and discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorney general's reach in cases where race and civil rights violations are potential factors grew in the 1994 Violent Crime Act that passed in the aftermath of the late Rodney King's beating by Los Angeles police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law gave the Justice Department power to bring civil suits against law enforcement agencies where a &quot;pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers&quot; exists that &quot;deprives persons of rights, privileges, and immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States or by the Constitution or laws of state.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EAST ST. LOUIS &gt; Man gets 57 months in robbery o A Michigan man was sentenced to 57 months in prison Tuesday for robbing a Highland bank in February, the U.S. attorney's office said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander P. Gerth, 18, of Troy, Mich., was one of two men who robbed the Bradford National Bank on Valentine's Day. The other was Ramsey Z. Fakhouri, 22, also of Troy, Mich., who was in a long-distance relationship with a bank employee and was trying to get $13,000 to buy her an engagement ring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men hatched the plan when they heard the unnamed employee explain the procedure by which the bank's ATM was stocked with cash, prosecutors said. They drove to Highland and used an air gun to rob the employee stocking the ATM, they said. On their way home, Fakhouri got a text from his girlfriend about the robbery, and returned by bus to comfort her. Gerth drove home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days after the robbery, Fakhouri's girlfriend was emailed a photo of the robbers, and Fakhouri tried unsuccessfully to explain why he appeared in the photos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police recovered most of the money that they'd taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fakhouri was sentenced to six and a half years in prison last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS COUNTY &gt; Man accused of beating baby son to death o A north St. Louis County man was charged with child abuse resulting in death after police said he struck his 3-month-old baby boy's head against a &quot;hard object&quot; on Tuesday. The baby, identified by St. Louis County Police as Skyy Ricks, died at a hospital later that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dearis L. Ricks, 21, of the 10800 block of Spring Garden Drive, was charged Tuesday. The baby was taken to a hospital after being found unresponsive at home. Ricks confessed, court documents say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was being held in lieu of $200,000 cash-only bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDWARDSVILLE, ILL. &gt; Police evidence thrown out o Authorities are trying to determine how and why evidence in more than 100 Alton cases has been destroyed or discarded, clouding prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madison County State's Attorney Tom Gibbons said his office learned on July 23 that an Alton Police Department evidence officer improperly disposed of the evidence in pending criminal cases, nearly half of them involving felonies, the (Alton) Telegraph reported Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence officer has been placed on administrative leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a very serious matter,&quot; said Gibbons, who has reached out to the U.S. attorney's office, Illinois State Police and the FBI to help with the investigation. Gibbons said he does not believe criminality factored into how the evidence - none of it involving money - went missing, though the investigation continues. Gibbons said the evidence includes items such as crack cocaine, heroin, guns, marijuana, a satchel, tools and surveillance tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbons said the most-affected cases involve major drug-dealing crimes, many of them developed by undercover operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS &gt; Looters hit shoe store off Gravois o The windows of a shoe store in St. Louis were smashed and the store looted late Monday, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 11:55 p.m., a caravan of cars pulled up to the Shoe Carnival at 3503 Bamberger Avenue in Gravois Plaza and 30 to 40 people got out, police say. The group, wearing T-shirts to cover their faces, smashed windows to get inside and stole shoes and other merchandise. Glass, shoes and socks littered the sidewalk in front of the store after the break-in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unarmed security guard saw the looting and called police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group also attempted to break into the Radio Shack store in the same plaza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis police Lt. Donnell Tanksley said he did not know whether the break-ins had anything to do with other looting in the wake of the fatal shooting of an unarmed teen by Ferguson police. But he said it is unusual that it was a caravan of vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Francis Slay said on Tuesday that city police are &quot;closely watching incidents like last night's for patterns and for connections to events outside the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slay added: &quot;The vast majority of people who want justice for Michael Brown are expressing themselves peacefully. A small number are not. So, our police will be doing their job keeping our citizens safe, protecting property, and arresting criminals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police later arrested two people acting suspiciously near the door of a Radio Shack in the 3400 block of Hampton Avenue. Police say they don't know whether that was related to the previous break-in at the Shoe Carnival.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where civil rights activist Al Sharpton goes, national attention follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So as the Rev. Sharpton arrived in St. Louis on Tuesday to add his voice to the many who have protested the shooting of Michael Brown, it was seen as an event - a kind of validation that the incident had become a national cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton walked arm-in-arm downtown Tuesday morning with Brown's family members, their attorney and clergy, before speaking to a crowd at the Old Courthouse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 50 people and twice as many reporters heard him call for peace, prayer and a continued push for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By evening, more than 1,000 people packed a church located half a mile from the shooting as the Baptist preacher and TV host hit on similar themes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known for crisscrossing the country to deploy to civil rights controversies, this is Sharpton's mode of operation. Recently, he led the charge against the handling of the Trayvon Martin case, calling the acquittal of George Zimmerman last year an &quot;atrocity&quot; and &quot;a slap in the face to those that believe in justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To his critics, Sharpton is a spectacle - and a divisive and self-serving one at that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To others, he is a galvanizing and potent orator and a mouthpiece for the message of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flanked by Michael Brown's parents at the Old Courthouse, Sharpton sought to keep the focus on that message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a cause for them,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;This is not some prop for politics. This is their child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said the purpose of his visit was to help the Brown family gain justice and to ensure federal authorities complete a full investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Brown was killed while showing an arms-in-the-air surrender sign to the police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Deal with the last sign he had shown,&quot; Sharpton said in a booming voice to a responsive crowd, with some clapping in agreement. &quot;We want answers why that sign was not respected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton lashed out against violent protests. &quot;To become violent in Michael Brown's name is to betray the gentile giant that he was,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;Don't be a traitor to Michael Brown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baltimore-based Pastor Jamal Bryant joined Sharpton, saying the Brown shooting has become a national event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;St. Louis is in fact bearing witness for America,&quot; he said. &quot;The Band-Aid has been ripped off, and all of America is seeing the open wound of racism exists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday wasn't the first time Sharpton has sought to draw attention to events in St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps his most notable visit came in 1999, when he was among 125 people arrested for standing on Interstate 70, bringing Monday morning rush hour traffic to a halt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action was taken to seek to increase minority participation on highway projects. A construction training program was initiated as a result, and including minority contractors has become a more common practice on various capital projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years later, Sharpton was back in St. Louis as a Democratic presidential candidate to push Metro to hire more minority contractors for a MetroLink expansion project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than two months later, in September 2003, Sharpton was here urging students to boycott the first day of classes at St. Louis Public Schools. Opponents were upset that a New York management company had been hired to run the school district that year, which included some school closings. High first-day attendance numbers showed that Sharpton's appearance had little bearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics have accused Sharpton of stoking controversy instead of working for resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Sharpton's biggest stumble as a civil rights activist came in 1987 when he fiercely defended Tawana Brawley, a 15-year-old African-American girl who claimed she had been assaulted and raped by six white men, some of them police officers, in upstate New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grand jury determined Brawley had fabricated her story. Sharpton and two other men were successfully sued for defamation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Sharpton drew a packed crowd to the Greater St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church, 9950 Glen Owen Drive. He did so at the same hour that faith leaders had already organized a competing forum at Christ the King United Church of Christ, on Old Halls Ferry Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown's cousin, Eric Davis, spoke prior to Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wasn't the type of kid who wanted to hurt anyone,&quot; Davis said of his cousin. &quot;What happened on Saturday was they cut my cousin's life short.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton took to the podium and spoke for more than a half-hour, with the Brown family behind him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you think you are mad, think about how they feel,&quot; he said to a crowd that repeatedly thundered in applause and amens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said he knows St. Louis and mentioned his prior activism here. He said he has been shining a light on injustices for years, making sure what is done in the dark is seen by the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This battle, he told the crowd, will take time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People should be in it for the long haul,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to have a long-term strategy. You can't be mad for two weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. A14</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">880 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As soon as the unrest in Ferguson is over - and let it be soon - there must be a thorough, independent and timely investigation into how and why it happened and the police response to it. This inquiry would go beyond the parallel criminal investigations and get into the root causes of this madness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, the immediate cause - the &quot;tipping point&quot; they call it in the literature of civil unrest - was the fatal shooting Saturday of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a still-unidentified Ferguson police officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(By the way, the failure to identify the officer violates every principle of transparency recommended by law enforcement experts. Society grants police officers the right to use deadly force. That right carries special obligations, one of which is strict public accountability. The longer the officer stays anonymous, the more public confidence is undermined.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the independent investigation deconstructs the Ferguson incident, as it must, it should explore the history and conditions that may have helped precipitate Saturday's shooting and the subsequent public protests. That includes racial segregation. That includes the training and qualifications of Ferguson police officers. It includes command-and-control decisions by the Ferguson and St. Louis County police forces and the Missouri Highway Patrol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One big problem with convening such an investigative panel is that it's not clear who has jurisdiction. The same problem plagues the entire response in Ferguson: Who has command authority? Who is accountable for the decisions that are being made?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fragmentation may be deliberate; it certainly mirrors the fragmentation that is the bane of the entire region. But the first rule of restoring public confidence is to earn it. Someone must step forward and take responsibility - both for the law enforcement effort that's currently underway and then for the investigation that must follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will have to be Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a man whose every instinct is to dodge bad news whenever possible. Sorry, governor. But you asked for the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By law, cities and counties are political subdivisions of the state. The state patrol already appears to be taking a lead role in crowd control efforts, though no one is saying so officially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can't be the city of Ferguson. It is one of 90 municipalities in St. Louis County. It has 21,000 residents, two-thirds of whom are black, and a police force of 53 commissioned officers, 90 percent of whom are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor can it be St. Louis County. The county has more than 800 police officers but no formal jurisdiction over law enforcement in Ferguson. At Ferguson's request, the county police force is helping out through mutual aid agreements, as are the state patrol and other municipal police forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nixon is the only public official with the authority to create an independent investigative commission. Public confidence demands that he announce plans to do so immediately. Its membership should be diverse and of unquestioned integrity. Its members should come from law enforcement, civil rights, academia and civic leadership. It's time to step up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police agencies may know who's in charge, but the public deserves to know, too. At whose order were police dogs brought in? Who authorized the use of tear gas and non-lethal baton rounds?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What central command authority is making sure that officers from multiple jurisdictions are singing from the same hymnal? Is anyone up to speed on the latest thinking in law enforcement about dealing with mass protests?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a lot of literature on that subject, dating back to the &quot;police riot&quot; at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago and forward to the 2011 London riots and &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;best practices&quot; study published in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin two years ago says it's generally accepted that &quot;crowd violence escalates if people think police offers treat them unfairly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the study says, when a crowd perceives that &quot;officers act with justice and legitimacy,&quot; disorder becomes less likely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops are human beings, and human beings get scared. Their first impulse is to gear-up as if they were patrolling outside Baghdad's Assassin's Gate. As in foreign policy, the academic types may say that dialogue and soft power are better, but that defies the average's cop's attitudes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the public generally regards as &quot;riot gear&quot; - helmets, shields, Kevlar vests - is known in police circles as &quot;hard gear.&quot; Here's what the FBI bulletin says about that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officers must avoid donning their hard gear as a first step. They should remember the lessons learned from the 1960s civil rights movement and Vietnam War protests. Police should not rely solely on their equipment and tools.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we've seen in Ferguson is skirmish lines of officers in hard gear and videos of tear gas canisters lobbed onto roofs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individual officers generally have shown great restraint. But those images are doing incalculable harm, and not just to community relations in Ferguson. The nation and the world have seen horrible images from St. Louis that suggest that race relations here have a long way to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're not wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are people of good will on all sides who want better. Ferguson should be the place where better begins. Mr. Nixon must get it started.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Rev. Al Sharpton held the media's attention in downtown St. Louis on Tuesday, an Illinois pastor and a Missouri state senator were across the street from the Ferguson Fire Station organizing their own rally to protest Saturday's police shooting of Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The young people aren't going to listen to Al Sharpton,&quot; said Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City &quot;They do not listen to older people. They do not listen to pretentious people.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So instead, she and the Rev. Derrick Robinson, who pastors a church in East St. Louis, organized a rally hoping to attract anyone - young people especially - who wanted to join them, as long as it was in peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's our generation that's being affected,&quot; said Jerika Tyler, 21, a student at Harris-Stowe State University. &quot;I have a 15-year-old brother. He could have been Michael Brown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small rallies and vigils like this one have popped up daily since Brown was shot and killed by a Ferguson police officer on a street outside Canfield Apartments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they have been overshadowed by what's taken place after sunset, when crowds have become violent, and police have deployed tear gas, rubber bullets and riot gear. Their prayer vigils, they feel, have gone unnoticed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The looting, Stefan Hornaday, 21, said, &quot;sickens me.&quot; But so does police brutality, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For hours protesters came and went, standing along the strip of grass separating the parking lot from the curb. Some drove in from St. Louis. Many lived in Ferguson. The conversations they held tapped into the undercurrent of the fear and frustration they've felt for years with police in and around this north St. Louis County community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamika McClain, of Breckenridge, said she's been pulled over numerous times, ticketed for such things as having a nonworking taillight or a broken blinker - allegations she said were false. Anthony Walsh said he isn't sure how to tell his children how to avoid being arrested. It's one thing to understand not to break the law, he said. &quot;But how to tell him how to deal with an ignorant cop?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, the death of 18-year-old Brown ignited anger that had been building for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poverty in the area is rising, with the highest concentrations in African-American neighborhoods. In several school districts, the quality of education is declining. A disproportionate number of foreclosures has taken its toll, and property values haven't recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the anger on Tuesday concerned the police - and skepticism that the investigation into what led to the shooting will bring justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're fed up,&quot; McClain said. &quot;We're tired. We want answers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She stood beside a friend who choked back emotion as she thought of her own children. &quot;They walk up and down that street all the time,&quot; Nicole Chissem said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her family lives near Canfield Avenue, the street on which Brown was shot. &quot;That could have been me on TV saying how I need justice for my child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the next several hours, protesters of various ages and races came and went from the rally, stopping by during lunch breaks. They denounced the looting and the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're out here fighting for something and the other messes up what you're fighting for, you don't get anywhere,&quot; said Dante Taylor, 22, of St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He held the marker and white poster board, trying to figure out what his sign should say.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday, Aug. 11, marked the 39th anniversary of the beginning of the Watts Riots (Revolt), which took place in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1965. This uprising was incited by a set of events, one of them being police violence against a young black man and a young black pregnant woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, we see a similar revolt taking place in Ferguson, right outside of St. Louis, where young, unarmed Michael Brown was shot and killed by an officer on his way to his grandmother's home. Michael Brown's killing and the ensuing outrage, at the same time of this historic event, ironically pivots the question, &quot;How can we best demonstrate our outrage about a historic violent tradition which leaves the blood of our children - young black men and women - repeatedly on the ground?&quot; If America has not fixed its &quot;problem with the negro,&quot; what must African-Americans do to demand a cease-fire across the nation and a new lens through which to see black bodies as more than indicators of the propensity toward crime and violence? It requires that we do more than pray. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, I attended an interfaith, interracial prayer vigil in front of the Ferguson Police Department, the occupational home of the officer who shot 18-year-old Michael Brown. As the ministers prayed - and I reflected on how many I had attended over the last two years - this constant refrain for &quot;peace&quot; and &quot;justice&quot; was starting to feel like a way to shut up the screaming parents and loved ones of those afflicted, silence the radical youth most directly impacted by these violences, and to privilege white desires for black people to always appear civil while reacting to uncivil manner. The latter is perhaps the ugliest requirement of those who suffer often at the hands of white racist attack and criminalization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I stood in front of the big brick police building, I found myself asking &quot;how such national peace-vigil moments activate anything more than a quick fix, or an anesthetic for this murder and the many violences which people of similar communities experience too frequently?&quot; In such a race-antagonistic America, can peace be the instrument of change, especially when the policies, employment of the law, and distribution of freedoms continue to disregard the demands and desires of those furthest down below?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I was having these thoughts, I hear a minister say &quot;Amen,&quot; concluding a powerful prayer that moved from peace talk to that of war. She is invested in addressing spiritual war: the heartache, pain and tears produced at the site of violence. My mind was moving to the more literal: a scene of rage, verbal exchange that produces powerful policy, and maybe even some threats to police power by the legislature. A group of young men and women, marching came to the center of Ferguson Road, parallel to the police department, first putting their hands in the air (a gesture which Michael Brown reportedly made to the police offer in order to show he was unarmed), then proceeded to sit in the street. Ironically, the ministers had began their vigil singing, &quot;We shall not be moved.&quot; The main organizer of the vigil discouraged this moment of outrage and sitting over her microphone, deeming it as having the potential to distract from the peaceful work we were doing as we gathered in prayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This attitude that the extreme rhetoric, sitting demonstrations and subsequent resistance of these grief-stricken, justifiably angered, and frustrated young is misplaced, inadvertently suggests that there is only one way to seek justice. For me, these young people are not simply saying ignore law enforcement, or disregard the law, but rather they voice a disinterest in the application of the law and the law enforcement we have come to know. Historically, the neighborhood where Michael Brown was killed has been ridden with racial tension, a police force which has rarely if ever understood itself as having a &quot;race problem.&quot; Constantly, young black men and women are subjected to verbal, if not physical violence and harassment from officers and those in the surrounding communities - who so often refer to this community as having a &quot;bad element.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of us, standing at the vigil in our clergy uniforms adorned with our varying degrees, were not subjected to these violences daily. Therefore, our call for peace and reconciliation is much easier. Most of us are not living in poverty-stricken communities, where the constant entitlement to our space, our property, and even our bodies angers us so, to claim entitlement to resources and material goods denied us historically (i.e. looting). Most of us, reading this post, have not felt without voice for many years and had an opportunity to speak publicly about the deepest terror we face at the hands of those who are supposed to protect us. This is not an indictment on those who stand where they stand, but rather commentary on the driving impulse of a different approach to the urgent hour. Indeed, if violence is approaching one's neighborhood, one can wait for gradual peace and justice; but when violence has arrived, one's actions can be strategically impulsive to demand urgent action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knowing this, I cannot see the responses to the killing of Michael Brown as anything but a scene of public disgust - a lawless reaction to a lawless white terrorizing history and present. Unfortunately, peace marches and demonstration have not been able to powerfully capture, or shift, this ugly reality. Indeed, Dr. King was very right in his framing, &quot; A riot is the language of the unheard!&quot; And these revolts must not be stopped by government, tear gas, or the guilt of the respectable others who are embarrassed by public expressions of pain and rage. May we allow this moment of revolt to remind us of the necessity of prayer and its companion we can call resistant, radical and inconvenient work! May this shaking of the streets remind the nation that the Michael Browning of our young men and women must stop!</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON&nbsp;o At two meetings with distinctly different tones, the call Tuesday night was for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Packed houses at two churches heard speakers discuss the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by a Ferguson police officer on Saturday afternoon - a killing that has rocked that suburb and drawn international attention to St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Christ the King United Church of Christ near Black Jack, speakers included Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, who told the standing-room audience, &quot;Justice must not simply be pursued, but in fact achieved. Instead of burning bridges in anger, we must rebuild them with love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racially diverse audience of about 400, many of whom were ministers, politely applauded the speakers, even Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who told them, &quot;I want what you want. I want the truth and I want justice and I want it as soon as possible.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other assembly at Greater St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church on Chambers Road east of Ferguson also was standing-room. It also was much louder and less formal - rocking at times - and the audience chanted and cheered as they waited for the Rev. Al Sharpton to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he took the pulpit, he led them in a thunderous chant, &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot; He noted that Ferguson has only a few black police officers and that most of the arrests are of black people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've got issues in this city,&quot; Sharpton said. People jumped to their feet when he spoke of seeking the truth and said, &quot;As soon as you turn on the lights, the roaches start running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the church on Chambers, several hundred people marched back and forth, their leaders urging everyone to be peaceful. A man yelled into a bullhorn, &quot;The whole world is watching... We are going to do this the right way. No violence, just justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the church in Florissant, other speakers included Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III and the pastor, the Rev. Traci Blackmon, who said, &quot;We are here because we will not rest until we have justice.&quot; Also attending were St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay and Police Chief Sam Dotson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the speeches, members of the audience asked questions. Someone asked why the Ferguson officer's name hasn't been released. St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch responded, &quot;It's a matter of protocol. We don't release names until charges are filed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STILL TENSE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the area Tuesday, events remained peaceful, if occasionally tense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after 6 p.m., more than 100 protesters gathered near the hulk of the QuikTrip at 9240 West Florissant Avenue, which was looted and burned during violence Sunday night and has been ground zero for the protests ever since. It also was where police in riot gear formed in sturdy formations and fired tear gas into a crowd Monday evening, scattering that night's protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday evening, protesters again chanted, &quot;Hands up, don't shoot&quot; - a rallying cry of the string of protests since Saturday. Riot police, backed by SWAT armored vehicles, blocked West Florissant. The crowd then marched toward the church where Sharpton was to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dominque Bishop, 22, of Florissant, said she was marching for her two brothers. &quot;It could have been one of my siblings,&quot; Bishop said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the evening, another crowd had again gathered at the QuikTrip but by about 11:30 p.m. it had mostly dispersed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been no violence since the looting rampage overnight Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the most part, the talk Tuesday was more redress, less outrage. From the Old Courthouse downtown to the White House in Washington, the calls were for nonviolence. President Barack Obama issued a statement urging Americans to remember Brown through &quot;reflection and understanding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Along with our prayers, that's what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the steps of the Old Courthouse on Tuesday morning, Sharpton stood with Brown's family and their lawyer and said people &quot;want answers,&quot; but should pursue them peacefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know you are angry,&quot; he told the gathering on the courthouse steps. &quot;I know this is outrageous ... But we cannot be more outraged than his mom and dad. If they can hold their heads in dignity, then we can hold our heads up in dignity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., whose district includes Ferguson, called for an &quot;expanded&quot; federal investigation to specifically explore &quot;the potential for any pattern or practice of police misconduct by the Ferguson Police Department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the place where Brown was killed in the 2900 block of Canfield Drive, his parents and other relatives gathered briefly Tuesday afternoon and released about a dozen red balloons. Then they walked to his grandmother's apartment, which they said had been his destination when he was shot Saturday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Clayton on Tuesday morning, police closed Carondelet Avenue near the county Justice Center during a march by about 250 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey hey, ho ho, racist cops have got to go,&quot; some in the crowd chanted. They also complained that there aren't enough African-Americans working as police officers and in the prosecutor's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clayton police cars were inching along, trailing protesters as they snaked through the streets that surround the county police headquarters and courthouse. March leaders demanded that authorities release the name of the Ferguson officer, fire and charge him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County police officials said Tuesday they had not fired rubber bullets Monday, as some protesters had claimed. Neither did assisting St. Louis officers, a spokeswoman said. Five people were treated for minor injuries at DePaul Health Center after the demonstrations Monday evening, a spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Tuesday, McCulloch announced that nine people were charged with felony burglary, accused of looting Sunday night at three Ferguson stores along West Florissant - the Princess Beauty Supply, the Footlocker and the Nu Fashion Beauty Supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charged were Beonca McGrath, 19, of the 4400 block of Jennings Station Road in Pine Lawn; Michael L. Davis, 27,of the 8300 block of Wabash Avenue in Berkeley; Robert Lee Stephenson, 28, of the 9500 block of Guthrie Avenue in Woodson Terrace; Trey T. Brewer, 18, of Dallas; Nikko Fiertag, 23, of the 9300 block of Clarion Drive in Ferguson; Andrew Henry, 30, of the 4100 block of Appleberry Lane in Berkeley; Steven C. Martin, 27, of the 8800 block of Maya Lane in Ferguson; Stephon D. Thompson, 19, of 5700 block of Goodfellow Boulevard in St. Louis; and DeMarco Harris, 38, of the 1200 block of Gimblin Avenue in St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGrath and Harris also were charged with misdemeanor possession of a stolen hair weave, and Fiertag was charged with misdemeanor stealing of a pair of sneakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The felony charges carry a maximum sentence of seven years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUSINESSES REOPEN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repairs continued along the looted district, and some businesses in Ferguson reopened Tuesday, including both locations that had been damaged and those that were closed as precaution. Zisser Tire &amp; Auto, which was ransacked, reopened. So did a Taco Bell nearby. But others, including Shoe Carnival and AutoZone, remained closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looting occurred Sunday night along West Florissant and at some stores to the north near Interstate 270, including the Walmart. Fear of fast-traveling replays caused some stores in Brentwood to close early Monday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson City Hall was closed Tuesday morning due to &quot;safety concerns,&quot; but classes began in the Jennings School District, just east of Ferguson. The Jennings district had canceled classes on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Aviation Administration barred private aircraft, including news helicopters, from the airspace over Ferguson for the next week. Commercial aircraft are exempt. The county police department made the request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before midnight Monday, a group of 30 to 40 people in a caravan of vehicles attacked and looted a Shoe Carnival store near Gravois Avenue in south St. Louis, far from Ferguson, St. Louis police said. Covering their faces with shirts, they smashed windows and stole shoes and other merchandise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group also tried to break into a nearby Radio Shack also in Gravois Plaza, in the 3500 block of Bamberger Avenue. An unarmed security guard saw the attacks and called police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police spokesman said it wasn't known whether the attack was related to Ferguson, but called the tactics of mass burglary unusual. Mayor Francis Slay said city police were &quot;closely watching incidents&quot; for any connections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokesmen at several area gun shops said sales had jumped, and they attributed the change to the violence in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Metro Shooting Supplies in Bridgeton, &quot;Sales have been absolutely amazing for three days,&quot; said general manager John Stephenson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Rothweiler, an owner of Mid America Arms at 8205 Gravois Road in South County, said sales were up about 50 percent. &quot;The things that have gone on have made people act,&quot; Rothweiler said, although he added, &quot;I don't like selling on fear.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson police are much more likely to stop, search and arrest African-American drivers than white ones. Last year, blacks, who make up a little less than two-thirds of the driving-age population in the North County city, accounted for 86 percent of all stops. When stopped, they were almost twice as likely to be searched as whites and twice as likely to be arrested, though police were less likely to find contraband on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pronounced as those statistics may seem, they don't necessarily make Ferguson an outlier. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures are provided by the state's attorney general's office, which collects the data from police agencies and creates a disparity index comparing the racial breakdown of drivers stopped to the racial breakdown of the driving age population in the police jurisdiction where they were stopped. An index of one means there is no disparity for a particular race. The index for blacks in Ferguson is 1.37.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statewide, the disparity index for blacks - 1.59 - is higher than in Ferguson. The same is true for many other local police jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the disparity index for whites, at 0.38, is one of the lowest in the state. The statewide index is 0.96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Missouri-St. Louis criminologist Rick Rosenfeld said the statistics for Ferguson don't stand out from many other St. Louis County municipalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think Ferguson would be at the top of many people's lists for racial tension between police and the community,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosenfeld also noted that the attorney general's data has some limitations, specifically that it doesn't account for whether drivers live in the jurisdiction where they're stopped. This means that an index could be skewed in an area with interstate highways, busy roads or shopping centers. Additionally, an officer may not know the race of a driver when making the decision to stop someone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosenfeld said the rate at which drivers are searched is a more useful metric. While the data doesn't prove the existence of racial profiling, the fact that Ferguson police were more likely to search a vehicle when the driver was black yet less likely to find contraband than when the driver was white could be more indicative of a problem, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Ferguson police searched 12.1 percent of black drivers they stopped, compared to 6.9 percent for whites. Contraband was found 22 percent of the time when the driver was black and 34 percent when the driver was white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosenfeld said he was puzzled about why the stop rate for whites was so low in Ferguson. He said one possible factor is that the black population in the area, as a whole, is younger than the white population. Older people are less likely to be stopped, he said, and are less likely to be on the roads in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was in Michigan last week, and the lead story in the Detroit papers was the trial of a 55-year-old man who was awakened at 4:30 in the morning last November by somebody pounding on his door and walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He didn't have a land line, and said he couldn't find his cellphone, so he grabbed a shotgun from his closet. He opened his front door and saw a person on his porch. He shot through the screen door. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The person on his porch was a 19-year-old woman. She was intoxicated. She had been in an accident three hours earlier and had wandered away. She was killed by the shotgun blast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was white and the woman was black. The man was convicted of second-degree murder last week, and the headline in one of the papers was a quote from the woman's mother. &quot;Her Life Mattered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the coverage in the papers, you'd have thought this was the first fatal shooting in Detroit in years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, of course, it wasn't. Detroit is like St. Louis. Murders are commonplace. What made this one so sensational was the racial angle. Still, why did this victim's life matter more than the lives of all the other victims?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thought of a column &quot;Donnybrook&quot; panelist Alvin Reid wrote a couple of weeks ago. This newspaper had just published a cartoon of St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley sitting at his desk with Harry Truman's famous slogan in front of him - &quot;The buck stops here.&quot; In the cartoon, Dooley had scratched off the final word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Dooley's supporters claimed the cartoon was racist, and that Dooley was being called a buck. I thought their contentions were ridiculous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reid wrote that as soon as he saw the cartoon, he thought the paper should not have published it. He compared it to an autostereogram. That is an illustration that has a hidden image in it. Not everybody can see it, he wrote. Maybe because I miss a lot of things, I liked that analogy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thought about it again when I returned from vacation and Ferguson was on fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can readily understand the black community's anger in the wake of the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. I like to give cops the benefit of the doubt, but I have a very hard time trying to figure out a justification for this shooting. Even if you accept the police version of events, the officer got out of his car and fired at an unarmed person. Maybe you shoot Carlos the Jackal if you think he might escape, but Michael Brown doesn't appear to have been an international terrorist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, too, there is the notion of being shot to death by the people who are supposed to protect us. Plus, of course, you have to factor in the long-standing animosity between law enforcement and young black males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, yes, I understand the anger and consider it justifiable. (Not the looting, though. I heard St. Louis Alderman Antonio French on the radio saying that the white community would be wrong to consider it thuggery and leave it at that. French is smart and thoughtful, and all things are complicated, but looting as a form of righteous protest is beyond me. Maybe it's an autostereogram.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But here is where I really get lost: Why not get angry at all the other killings?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a community gets together and rises up, it has power. In this case, the authorities are not going to be able to sweep this shooting under the rug. No way. Authorities in Detroit were not able to ignore the shooting of that 19-year-old woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet, had that young woman been shot a couple of hours earlier by a young black man, it would not have been big news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had Michael Brown been shot a couple of hours later by a young black man, his killing would have been scarcely noted. Not by the media, and not by the black community. No marches, no protests, no nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not condoning police shootings to point out that they constitute a minuscule fraction of the shootings that ravage black neighborhoods. It's not the cops, and it's not the Klan. It's the residents themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the black community would come together on those shootings and say, &quot;No more,&quot; there would be no more. Where was the outrage when 11-year-old Antonio Johnson was shot to death as he sat in his apartment doing homework in March? The gunman climbed to the window ledge and fired into the apartment. There were three teens in that apartment. Presumably, one was the intended target. I say presumably because the family did not cooperate with the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No celebrities came to town to demand justice for Antonio. In fact, nobody said much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's another autostereogram. I can't see the picture.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities on Tuesday delayed revealing the identity of the police officer who fatally shot an unarmed teen and set off a wave of community outrage, citing threats against the officer on social media. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we come out and say, 'It was this officer,' then he immediately becomes a target,&quot; Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said. &quot;We're taking the threats seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson, who had said he would reveal the name Tuesday, said there is no timetable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Associated Press reported that witnesses said Michael Brown, 18,  raised his hands to surrender before the shots were fired. Police have not confirmed that. The shooting set off two nights of violent protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters promising a peaceful rally gathered across the street from the St. Louis County Police Department's Clayton headquarters. Also in attendance: about 50 police officers from 10 area departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said that protesters Monday night threw rocks at police and that gunfire came from the crowd, so officers used tear gas and shot &quot;beanbag rounds&quot; meant to stun them. There were 15 arrests but no reports of the looting that rocked the suburban St. Louis city Sunday night, KSDK-TV reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a lot of young people reacting to getting shot at with tear gas,&quot; said protester Shawn Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a community forum Monday, national NAACP President Cornell William Brooks demanded justice while condemning the violence and looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement Tuesday, President Obama called Brown's death &quot;heartbreaking,&quot; and he sent &quot;deepest condolences&quot; to his family and the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation, along with local officials,&quot; Obama added. &quot;I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country to remember this young man through reflection and understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that's what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old African American  fresh out of high school, has joined a long line of  black males gunned down or wrestled down and killed. The white men and/or police officers pulling the trigger claim &quot;reasonable fear&quot; or &quot;self-defense.&quot; At the same time, Chicago has experienced a rash of young blacks in gangs killing each other over &quot;territory&quot; or in &quot;retaliation.&quot; It's not just whites killing young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A St. Louis Post-Dispatch photograph shows Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, holding a sign reading: &quot;Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!&quot; Police report that Brown shoved the officer into his car, tried to take his gun and a shot was fired. Obviously, there are conflicting reports so it's premature to come to conclusions, but a full federal investigation into what happened is essential. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I understand the  anger. Protests are legitimate,  but Michael Brown's family said that things should not be made worse with looting and vandalism. It will only cloud the real issues. It will not bring Michael Brown back and will not facilitate justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How could this happen in suburban Ferguson, Mo.? Many African Americans who grew up around St. Louis got a good education and secured good jobs at McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) or elsewhere. Better off economically, they moved into various suburban communities in North St. Louis County -- Normandy, Florissant, Bellefontaine Neighbors, Jennings, Berkeley (home of Cedric the Entertainer), Dellwood and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson is a suburban community that has changed from majority white to 70% African American. I know some of the families there, including two white families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a hardworking, church-going and middle-to-working class community. Families here struggle economically to keep their heads above water. There is also a smaller but growing poor community in Ferguson. It reflects what's happening in America generally. When journalists and politicians speak of a dwindling middle class that's under economic assault and a poor community that's getting bigger, they're talking about Ferguson. Independent of the racial demographics and dynamics of Ferguson, Mo., there's a &quot;Ferguson&quot; near you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since President Lyndon Johnson, there has been little effort to rebuild America. Thus we should not be surprised that urban and rural communities, and all points in between, have deteriorated after decades of neglect. If Republicans are the party of &quot;no,&quot; Democrats are the party of &quot;don't know.&quot; They haven't fought for bold ideas to turn us in a new direction. Policies of community development are being replaced with policies of community containment. We don't have a domestic Marshall Plan, but martial law is a reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's America today: High unemployment and low graduation rates result in guns and drugs in and jobs out. Hospitals and public schools are closing. Gym, art, music and trade skills are taken out of our public schools. Roads crumble, bridges fall and our public transportation system is outdated. Entrepreneurs have no capital. Abandoned homes and vacant lots spread. Frivolous entertainment, texting and Twitter replace serious news reporting, reading, writing and arithmetic.  All of which leads to hopelessness, despair and cynicism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many are observing Ferguson and witnessing the demonstrations, looting and vandalism and calling for quiet. But quiet isn't enough. The absence of noise isn't the presence of justice. We must demand justice in Ferguson and the other Fergusons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too many Americans have adjusted to injustice and inequality. But injustice and inequality anywhere is a threat to justice and equality everywhere. To allow injustice and inequality invites a a Ferguson to your community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department is leading a broad review of police tactics, including the kind of deadly force that prompted recent protests in Missouri and New York, a federal law enforcement official said Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The review is being conducted as the department weighs the creation of a national commission to provide new direction on such controversial issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to deadly force, the review is expected to examine law enforcement's increasing encounters with the mentally ill, the application of emerging technologies such as body cameras, and police agencies' expanding role in homeland security efforts since 9/11, said the official, who is not authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The review is slated to be completed early next year while officials consider establishing a special law enforcement commission similar to a panel created by President Lyndon Johnson to deal with problems then associated with rising crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than violent crime, which has been in decline in much of the country, police are now grappling with persistent incidents involving use of force and their responses to an array of public safety issues, from drug overdoses to incidents involving the mentally ill and the emotionally disturbed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call for a broader federal policy review, while not directly tied to any specific incident, grew out of a meeting involving law enforcement advocacy groups and Justice officials, including Attorney General Eric Holder, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody has looked at the profession in any holistic way in more than 50 years,&quot; the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week, Holder announced that federal authorities were opening an inquiry into last week's shooting death of a Missouri teenager by local police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, the Justice Department has been monitoring a local investigation in New York into the death of a 43-year-old man after being subdued by local police last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both incidents have sparked volatile reactions from local residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most tense are playing out in the suburbs of St. Louis, where for two nights police have clashed with demonstrators who are protesting the death of Michael Brown, the teenager who was fatally shot Saturday in an altercation with police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve,&quot; the attorney general  said this week as he announced the FBI's deployment to the Brown shooting death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Association of Chiefs of Police, the nation's largest group of local law enforcement officials, has long advocated for the revival of the Johnson administration commission to provide needed direction to an institution whose responsibilities have expanded markedly in the past half-century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, then-IACP president Michael Carroll, while supporting a congressional push for such a panel, said police were &quot;confronting a vast array of new challenges and demands that would have seemed unimaginable just a short time ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those demands, he cited increasing police involvement in immigration matters, overburdened court systems and a &quot;continuing need to ensure the protection of (citizens') civil rights and civil liberties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Pittsburgh law professor David Harris, who has written extensively on law enforcement matters, said a new commission could offer law enforcement &quot;empirical evidence for a better way to do business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no reason why we can't and shouldn't be able to learn from those who are doing things better to create the best practices for everybody,&quot; Harris said. <BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Houston Mayor Takes On Texas Abortion Law. If House Bill 2 goes into effect in Texas on Sept. 1, only six or seven abortion clinics will be left open in the state, and Mayor Annise Parker of Houston is calling for its repeal. Mayor Parker, along with eight members of the Houston City Council, sent a letter to the Texas Legislature and U.S. Congress, calling on members to pass the Women's Health Protection Act. The act, cosponsored by 35 U.S. Senators including Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), would prohibit states from enacting restrictive measures--like House Bill 2--on access to abortion services.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">#IfTheyGunnedMeDown Sends Powerful Message. In the wake of the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teenager, by police in Ferguson, Mo., folks took to Twitter to illustrate how the media can construct negative narratives of gun violence victims, especially if they're a racial minority. With the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown, users paired two different images of themselves to demonstrate how news outlets would choose the photo that could be distorted over the photo of personal triumph--like graduation or army service. According to the BBC, the hashtag was used more than 100,000 times in 24 hours. [NPR]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uber Caught Lyfting Rides From The Competition. According to data Lyft provided to CNN Money, the San Francisco-based transportation company was sabotaged by employees of their direct competitor: Uber. Uber, named the 2013 tech company of the year by USA Today, is being accused of having their employees book and cancel Lyft rides, which decreases driver availability and threatens those driver's income. Lyft discovered Uber's tactics by cross-referencing &quot;phone numbers associated with known Uber recruiters with those attached to accounts that have canceled rides,&quot; according to CNN Money. It's a war of the ridesharing worlds--whose side are you on? [CNN Money]</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The John Birch Society has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting of 18-year-old Micheal Brown by a police officer, sparked riots, looting, vandalism, and large protests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riots in Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis, began Sunday following a vigil for Michael Brown, who was shot and killed by a police officer on Saturday afternoon. The riots continued on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost from the beginning, estimates of the number of people involved in the riots, the damage inflicted on businesses, and testimonies from eyewitnesses of the shooting varied greatly and conflicted with police reports. A minimum of 12 businesses were heavily damaged and looted, and at least one, QuikTrip, a gas and convenience store, was burned to the ground. Numbers of those involved in the riot varied between two hundred and several thousand, many from out of town. Business owners in the area, some of them armed, prepared to defend themselves as the riots escalated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dorian Johnson, he and a friend, Michael Brown, an 18-year-old who had graduated from high school earlier this year and was prepared to start classes at a local technical college on Monday, were walking down the middle of a street in Ferguson, a town of 21,000 about 10 miles northwest of downtown St. Louis, when a police cruiser pulled up alongside them and an officer told them to walk on the sidewalk. Eyewitness Piaget Crenshaw said that Johnson, Brown, and the officer &quot;got into a verbal confrontation and the officer attempted to put Brown in the police car. When Brown began to flee, his hands in the air, the officer got out of the car and started shooting at Brown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another eyewitness at the scene told the press that the officer was in his car when he started shooting at the boys. Johnson said that he and Brown started running when they heard the first shot. The officer &quot;shot again and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air. He started to get down and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County police chief, Jon Belmar, held a news conference on Sunday morning, saying that a man had been shot and killed after he assaulted a police officer and the two had struggled over the officer's gun inside his patrol car. At least one shot was fired from inside the car, said Belmar. A slightly different version came from a report on the incident by the Wall Street Journal:</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States Army, The Government of USA has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fort Sill's Sgt. 1st Class Adrian Villareal, Senior Leaders Course (SLC) instructor, was one of seven Soldiers who became the first to receive the Army Instructor Badge during a recognition ceremony July 17 in Alexandria, Va.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for how this impacts the Army, Villareal said the badge recognizes instructors' efforts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the badge is a great thing to have because it lets us know and everyone else that instructors are on the same sheet of music as the drill sergeants and recruiters,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Army chief of staff, and sergeant major of the Army recognized the instructors for their participation in Training and Doctrine Command's (TRADOC) Instructor Development and Recognition Program (IDRP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of the program, designed by TRADOC's Institute for Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development, is to coach, mentor and train instructors who teach at noncommissioned officer academies throughout the Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our Soldiers are the best at what they do because of the training they receive from world-class instructors,&quot; said Command Sgt. Maj. Daniel Dailey, TRADOC CSM, and narrator for the IDRP ceremony. &quot;These first seven Army Instructor Badge recipients represent the thousands of dedicated professionals in our Army who teach, coach and mentor tomorrow's future leaders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ceremony served as a foundation on which the Army can promote instructor achievement through personal and professional growth, inspiring others to do the same, said Master Sgt. Elsi Inoa-Santos, IDRP manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This award codifies and recognizes hard work,&quot; said Sgt. 1st Class Brian Ditzler, an Army Instructor Badge recipient from the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Benning, Ga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ditzler has 16 years of service with two years as an instructor at the Henry Caro NCO Academy. He said the badge is more than the individual recognition; it symbolizes the team effort of developing the backbone of America's Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not just for me, but for my team and all the hard work they have put in to develop NCOs who come through the NCO academy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Villareal said he is proud to be an instructor and enjoys facilitating learning among senior enlisted Soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this job I have right here, I impact the Army more than in any other job I can think of. Back to the badge and why it's important, we're not just training privates, and we're not just people to be led. We're trying to send out leaders; if we're not doing that in a good way, then we could be setting up the Army for a loss. We have to be able to keep the information relevant and keep the students interested,&quot; said Villareal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said part of training the Army's leaders is showing them how to make a difference, not only in their units, but Armywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like to challenge these guys to find those regs and find something wrong with them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, a suggestion made in SLC was accepted and changed Army Regulation 350-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sending those leaders back now they know if they see something that's wrong they don't just complain about it. You've got to show your Soldiers, look you can make a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other five instructors to receive the badge were:<BR>-- Sgt. 1st Class Michael Brown, Quarter Master Corps, Fort Lee, Va.<BR>-- Sgt. 1st Class Kevin Johnson, Aviation Center of Excellence, Fort Eustis, Va.<BR>-- Staff Sgt. Justin Scott Ross, Maneuver Center of Excellence, National Guard, Starke, Fla.<BR>-- Sgt. 1st Class Jacqueline Sauve, Intelligence Center of Excellence, Fort Huachuca, Ariz.<BR>-- Sgt. 1st Class Bryan Vann, Army Cyber Center of Excellence Fort Gordon, Ga.<BR>-- Sgt. 1st Class Bryan Vann, Cyber Center of Excellence Fort Gordon, Ga.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The White House has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This afternoon, President Obama issued a statement on the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was fatally shot on Saturday by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time. As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as needed.

Along with our prayers, that's what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric Holder also released a statement yesterday on the shooting, calling for a federal investigation to supplement the inquiry by local authorities:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shooting incident in Ferguson, Missouri this weekend deserves a fulsome review. In addition to the local investigation already underway, FBI agents from the St. Louis field office, working together with attorneys from the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and US Attorney's Office, have opened a concurrent, federal inquiry. The federal investigation will supplement, rather than supplant, the inquiry by local authorities. At every step, we will work with the local investigators, who should be prepared to complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right. I will continue to receive regular updates on this matter in the coming days. Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.</SPAN></P>

A law signed this week prohibits direct contact between members of the public and big cats at travelling animal shows and fairs.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW ORLEANS: New Orleans police are investigating a drive-by shooting that killed a man and an 18-year-old woman and wounded five other people, three of them children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting happened around 8 p.m. Sunday in the city's Lower 9th Ward, a neighborhood that was ravaged by Hurricane Katrina and has struggled with crime.<BR>Officer Frank Robertson says a woman and two boys aged 2 and 4, were in critical condition and a 13-year-old girl and a 37-year-old woman were in stable condition.<BR>Robertson says all the victims were in front of a house when a dark car occupied by several men drove up, opened fire and sped off. Police have not release very many details of the shooting or a description of the suspects.<BR>In a separate incident in the city of St. Louis, protesters clashed with police and looted stores after an officer shot dead an unarmed black teen, local media reported Monday.<BR>Police armed with clubs hurled tear gas and deployed officers with dogs to curb the violence that erupted late Sunday in Ferguson, in the Midwestern state of Missouri, reports said.<BR>But local law enforcement officers were quickly overwhelmed and had to urgently call for backup from nearby communities, according to KSDK TV 5.<BR>Video posted by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch showed a gas station convenience store plundered and set on fire.<BR>Looters also raided a Walmart and several other smaller stores, and set fires elsewhere, the newspaper reported.<BR>The violence broke out after large crowds of mostly African-American protesters gathered Sunday for a vigil at the spot where police shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown a day earlier.<BR>Details of Brown's death differ. A witness identified as Dorian Johnson told KMOV News 4 that he was walking with Brown when a police officer confronted them and drew his weapon.<BR>The officer shot Brown, who &quot;turned around and put his hands in the air,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;He started to get down and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.&quot;<BR>St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, however, said at a televised Sunday news conference that Brown was killed after physically assaulting a police officer and struggling to get his weapon.<BR>Belmar did not say whether the officer was white.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, 18, died after being hit multiple times in the suburb of Ferguson in St Louis on Saturday on the way to his grandmother's house, provoking angry confrontations between officers and members of the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in Missouri are calling for calm after shops were looted and car windows were vandalised following a vigil for the black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Mr Brown and another man were involved in a scuffle with an officer, who shot the teenager after an alleged struggle for a gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not clear if the teenager was the man who struggled with the officer but police confirmed he was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around around 100 protesters took to the streets on Sunday, with some chanting &quot;No Justice! No Peace!&quot;, while others held up their hands saying &quot;Don't shoot me!&quot; as armed officers looked on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the day, thousands packed the suburb in St Louis where he died in a vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small groups were seen afterwards looting a supermarket, breaking into shops along a main road near the shooting, smashing car windows and carrying away armfuls of stolen goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Television footage showed streams of people walking out of an off-licence carrying bottles of alcohol, and in some cases protesters were standing on police cars or taunting officers standing around in riot gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing drew criticism from civil rights leaders, who compared it to the 2012 shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighbourhood watch member, who was acquitted of murder charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman had followed Mr Martin without orders and said he shot the teenager, who was black, in &quot;self-defence&quot;, despite him being unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Gaskin, from the St Louis branch of American civil rights group NAACP, said: &quot;We're outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Knowles, the mayor of Ferguson, said a small group of people were creating a &quot;huge mess&quot; on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help,&quot; he told KTVI-TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbours. There's nothing productive from this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We understand people want to vent their frustrations. We understand they want to speak out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to obviously try to urge calm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no reports of injuries by Monday morning but authorities had been alerted to &quot;widespread&quot; property damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second person involved in the confrontation where Mr Brown was killed has not been arrested or charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Jackson, the chief of Ferguson Police Chief, told KSDK-TV there was no apparent video footage of the shooting from a nearby apartment complex, from any police dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department has purchased but not put into use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said he had graduated from school and was about to enter a local university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she doesn't understand why police didn't subdue her son with a baton or taser, and she said the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,&quot; she said, fighting back tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race of the officer involved in the shooting has not been disclosed but authorities said he had been with the Ferguson Police Department for six years and has been placed on paid administrative leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation, which could be referred to the FBI.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, MO. (AP) &amp;GT;&amp;GT; Michael Brown Sr. stood alone in the center of the narrow street where the blood of his namesake son still stained the gray pavement, two days after the 18-year-old was shot dead by a police officer. He straightened a waist-high wooden cross and re-lit the candles erected as part of a makeshift memorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big Mike,&quot; as some of his friends called Michael Brown Jr., wasn't the type to fight, family and neighbors said, though he lived in a restless neighborhood where police were on frequent patrol. His parents and neighbors described him as a good-hearted kid with an easy smile who certainly wouldn't have condoned the violence and looting that spread though his north St. Louis suburb following his death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was funny, silly, he would make you laugh,&quot; his father said, and when there was &quot;any problem going on, any situation, there wasn't nothing that he couldn't solve. He could bring people back together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown, who was unarmed, was shot Saturday by a Ferguson police officer while walking with a friend down the center of the street. Police have said a scuffle broke out after the officer asked the boys to move to the side. Witnesses say Brown's arms were in the air   in a sign of surrender   as a white policeman repeatedly shot the black youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a vigil Sunday night, an angry crowd looted stores, and a night later police in Ferguson fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse protesters. The U.S. Justice Department has announced that its civil rights division was opening an investigation, and Brown's family retained the same lawyer who had represented relatives of Trayvon Martin   the Florida teen killed in a racially charged 2012 shooting. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton was to meet with Brown's family today as tensions remained high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was among a small group of students who had graduated Aug. 1 from Normandy High School, needing the summer to finish their required credits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't even celebrate; we've got to plan a funeral,&quot; said his tearful mother, Lesley McSpadden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had been staying at his grandmother's apartment, where he would often hang out in the parking lot tossing a football with friends, said Markese Mull, a neighbor whose 17-year-old-son was one of Brown's closer friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was an aspiring rapper, though it was more of a hobby. This week, he was supposed to start college in pursuit of a career as a heating and air conditioning engineer. On the day of this death, Brown had walked with another friend to a nearby convenience store. Mull saw them in the street and honked his horn to say to &quot;hi&quot;   just minutes before the police officer came by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was never a person who liked confrontation,&quot; Mull said. &quot;His smile was going to make you smile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbors described Brown as quiet and respectful   a &quot;good boy,&quot; who &quot;was never in trouble,&quot; said Sharon Johnson, 58, who lives just a little ways down the street. Johnson said Brown would frequently stop to chat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We talked about how when you turn yourself to the Lord you feel so good   and good things come your way,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;He had a more mature mind than a little boy's mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Johnson was standing at the side of the street where Brown was shot as a woman who had driven in from a nearby community preached loudly to anyone willing to listen about the importance of peaceful protests and parental discipline for teenagers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A passing car stopped, letting out a man wearing a newly made black T-shirt bearing Brown's baby picture and the words &quot;NO JUSTICE NO PEACE.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm his father,&quot; he said somberly, eliciting hugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The older Brown picked up a piece of cardboard that had been lying on the ground. &quot;End police brutality,&quot; it read. He placed it on a pile of toy animals stacked by a streetlight pole, then set about straightening up his son's mid-street memorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had just returned to the grass when a gunshot rang out. Then another. And another. It was time to go.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rioting and looting erupted in Ferguson, Missouri, late on Sunday and spread to neighboring towns as protests over the killing of a black teenager by a police officer turned violent, police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds broke the windows of cars and stores, set a building alight and looted shops after a day of demonstrations over the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old shot on Saturday by a Ferguson police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is &quot;a lot of unrest up there, and a lot of rioting going on, and looting&quot;, Officer Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department, said early on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the unrest had spread from Ferguson, a largely black St. Louis northern suburb, to adjacent communities. About 150 officers in riot gear from throughout St. Louis County had been sent to the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schellman said arrests had been made but did not elaborate. He and three hospitals had no reports of injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Brown was shot after a struggle over a gun in a police car. It was not immediately clear why Brown was in the car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the office fired more shots before leaving the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and has been put on administrative leave, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told a news conference. The officer's race has not been disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's protests turned violent after dark, according to news station KMOV-TV, with rioters smashing windows of stores and restaurants and damaging cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KMOV TV footage showed a QuikTrip convenience store set on fire after it was looted. A teenage witness told KMOV, &quot;They destroyed everything&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobs rushed out of other stores, including an AutoZone and a Ross Dress for Less, with armfuls of stolen goods, KMOV and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's mother told TV station KSDK that her son was a &quot;good child getting ready to go to college&quot; and that he was visiting his grandmother when the shooting took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Louis County branch of the NAACP, a national civil rights group, has said it wants the FBI to look into the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights leader, said in a statement on Sunday that he had spoken with Brown's grandfather and had agreed to visit the St. Louis area to help the family.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Carey Gillam and Jason McLure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police fired tear gas after rioting broke out for a second night in Ferguson, Missouri, despite calls on Monday for calm from the mother of a black teenager who was shot to death by police at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said officers were focused on dispersing the crowd, which was smaller than the night before, but were making arrests and reported being fired on at some locations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are shooting at us now,&quot; Jackson said, adding that officers from 10 to 15 jurisdictions were assisting Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, 18, was shot to death in Ferguson, a mostly black St Louis suburb, on Saturday afternoon after what police said was a struggle with a gun in a police car. The FBI has opened a probe into the racially charged case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's family has hired Benjamin Crump, the attorney who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager who was shot to death by a community watch volunteer in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in riot gear fired tear gas to disperse a crowd estimated in the hundreds gathered near a building that burned during Sunday night's rioting, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fire trucks, ambulances and more officers converged on the area in a chaotic scene. One officer in riot gear stood behind a squad car in a standoff with a group of young demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emergency services said they had responded to reports of a stabbing and a shooting, but had not confirmed such incidents and emergency workers were told later to pull back from the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness in the case told local media Brown had raised his arms to police to show he was unarmed before being killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He just graduated and was on his way to college,&quot; said Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, speaking through tears at a news conference. She said her first-born son's first day back at school would have been Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't even celebrate,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI opened a federal inquiry into the case intended to supplement the main investigation by St. Louis County police, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not immediately clear from police why Brown was in the police car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OFFICER NOT IDENTIFIED<BR>The officer, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and has been put on administrative leave, police said. The officer's race has not been disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson told television station KMOV that he and Brown had been walking when an officer confronted them, drew a weapon and shot. Johnson said that Brown put his hands in the air and started to get down, but the officer kept shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said there was plenty of physical evidence and witness testimony. &quot;I really believe we can get to the truth of what happened here,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrations to call for justice for Brown turned violent Sunday night. Crowds broke the windows of cars and stores, set a building on fire and looted shops. At least two dozen businesses were damaged, 32 people were arrested, and two officers injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it is crazy. It's nonsense. What does it bring back? It's not going to bring the man back,&quot; said Adrian Brewer, 30, an African American from a city near Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of demonstrators had gathered earlier on Monday at the town's police station to demand that the officer responsible for Brown's death face murder charges. Police arrested up to 15 people during that mostly peaceful demonstration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday night, demonstrators driven out by tear gas gathered at the station, chanting &quot;hands up, don't shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's mother said her son had been planning to study heating and air conditioning repair at a technical college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown Sr., the teen's father, told reporters his son was &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;could make you laugh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need justice for our son,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the Ferguson Police Department's 53 members are black, Jackson said. About two-thirds of Ferguson's population of about 21,000 are black, according to U.S. Census figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson's median household income is $37,517, less than the Missouri average of $47,333.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the communities around Ferguson have gone from white to mostly black in the last 40 years, said Terry Jones, political science professor at University of Missouri-St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a long history of racial injustice,&quot; said Jones. &quot;Slowly and not so surely, the St. Louis metropolitan area has been trying to figure out a way forward. As the Michael Brown shooting indicates, there are often setbacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family of John Crawford III, the man killed in an officer-involved shooting in Walmart last week, held a news conference Monday in Dayton. Crawford's father, John Crawford Jr. of Tennessee, and his mother, Tressa Sherrod of Fairfield, were joined by other family friends and members of the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Crawford III, 22, died in an officer-involved shooting at Walmart in Beavercreek. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Williams died after collapsing during the shooting incident last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAYTON - The family of a 22-year-old man shot and killed by Beavercreek police at Walmart last week want to see the surveillance videos of the incident, but a Walmart spokesman said only law enforcement may have access for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a Monday press conference, family members of John Crawford III demanded answers to questions about what led to his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beavercreek police officers Sean Williams and Sgt. David Darkow responded last Tuesday to a 911 call about a man waving a gun inside the Walmart at 3360 Pentagon Blvd. Police say Crawford, confronted inside, did not respond to officers' demands that he drop the weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crawford was shot in the torso and died. He was carrying an air rifle/ pellet gun that he had picked off a shelf from inside the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no doubt in my mind that once we receive everything in its entirety, the evidence, i.e. everything else that's out there, that he will be vindicated,&quot; John Crawford Jr. said during a press conference at the Dayton offices of attorney Michael Wright. &quot;My son was not a monster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walmart spokesman Brian Nick said the Bureau of Criminal Investigation has &quot;everything they've asked for&quot; and that, &quot;in terms of giving it or allowing access to anyone else at this time, it wouldn't be appropriate because it's an ongoing criminal investigation.&quot; The bureau, an arm of the Ohio Attorney Gen's , an investigation into the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick said the Beavercreek Walmart did have at least one asset protection associate working the night of the shooting, but he would not say what action, if any, the asset protection associate(s) took that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokeswoman Jill Del Greco of the Ohio Attorney General's Office said, &quot;The video is not public record from our office because it is considered Confidential Law Enforcement Investigatory Records/Investigatory Work Product.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio law generally requires law enforcement agencies to release copies of records once investigations are complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Crawford's family and Derrick Foward of Dayton's chapter of the NAACP, Wright said it was his understanding that Williams was the officer whose shot hit Crawford. The AG's office would not comment on that assertion. Wright also asked the U.S. attorney's office to monitor the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to understand the communication between the Beavercreek police department and Walmart security,&quot; Wright said. &quot;We need to understand why, if this BB gun was indistinguishable by the Beavercreek police department, why wasn't it locked in the case with the other firearms?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why did John Crawford, a Walmart customer, get shot and killed carrying a BB gun in a store that sells BB guns? All the family demands is answers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Montgomery County Coroner's office has listed Crawford's manner of death as homicide, or death caused by another person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wright said he doesn't know if race played any part in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; a race issue,&quot; Wright said. &quot;This is a public safety issue. This could have been any one of your children in Walmart holding a BB gun that was mistaken for a real gun and got shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foward said he appreciated that Beavercreek police Chief Dennis Evers called in the Attorney's General's Office to do an independent, third-party investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not want the community, at this point in time, to be in a roar about anything until all the facts come out,&quot; Foward said. &quot;There has not been an uproar inside the community, but, however, people are on edge. So don't think that people are not on edge with another African American losing their life at the hands of a police officer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Crawford Jr. said his son was an only child, a high school graduate and an active father of two sons. Crawford's father described him as a loving son and grandson and a &quot;typical 22-year-old.&quot; Wright said Crawford only had minor scrapes with the law and that he &quot;was not a felon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darkow's personnel file shows, released Monday by Beavercreek police, showed that he met or exceeded all criteria in his latest review and has had letters of recognition with no major disciplinary action against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">' included several letters of recognition, including one for his actions during a 2010 bank robbery investigation. Williams, a nine-year veteran, was put on administrative leave after he was involved in the city's first fatal police-involved shooting on June 27, 2010. A Greene County grand jury determined Williams acted correctly and in self-defense in that incident. Williams also had a letter of discipline for conduct unbecoming of an officer from September 2011. In his most recent job performance review, the officer met or exceeded all of the categories listed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beavercreek officials have not provided copies of the officers' written narratives on the incident report, saying the statements were being reviewed by BCI before they would be released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Williams, 37, of Fairborn, also died during the Tuesday incident after suffering a medical condition as she tried to leave Walmart with her daughter. Family and friends gathered for a viewing Monday at the Belton-Stroup Funeral Home in Fairborn for her visitation, including members of the Forgotten Breed Motorcycle Club. She was scheduled to have married a club member last weekend, according to posts by family members on social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some social media websites have advocated for a moment of silence Thursday to spotlight three recent police-involved deaths: Crawford; Michael Brown, who was killed Saturday by St. Louis County Police in Missouri; and Eric Garner, the man who died recently after police put him in a choke-hold in New York.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, MO. Tensions remained high Monday in parts of suburban St. Louis after a fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man led to overnight looting, vandalism and dozens of arrests. A closer look at the town of Ferguson, where 18 year old Michael Brown was killed: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Location: Ferguson is about 10 miles north of downtown St. Louis in the broader area known to locals as North County. The 2010 census counted about 21,000 residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commerce: Ferguson is home of the global headquarters of Emerson Electric Co., a Fortune 500 company. Just outside the city limits is Express Scripts, the nation's largest company that manages pharmacy benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White flight: Ferguson and other parts of north St. Louis County were predominantly white communities before school desegregation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demographics:About two thirds of residents are now black. Fewer than half of the approximately 9,100 homes are owner occupied, and about a quarter of residents live below the federal poverty level.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is &quot;a lot of unrest, and a lot of rioting, and looting&quot;, officer Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St Louis County Police Department, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the unrest had spread from Ferguson, a largely black St Louis suburb, to adjacent communities. About 150 officers in riot gear had been sent to the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Schellman said arrests had been made but had no details. Police said Mr Brown was shot after an alleged struggle over a gun in a police car. The officer involved is a six-year veteran and has been put on administrative leave. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Streets in Ferguson were upended in the Sunday night riots and police made 32 arrests. TV footage showed streams of people carting bottles of alcohol from a liquor store, and video posted online by the St Louis Post-Dispatch showed a convenience store on fire. Several businesses were looted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People took items from a sporting goods shop and a mobile phone retailer, and carted rims away from a tyre outlet. Some climbed atop police cars as the officers with riot shields and batons stood stoic nearby, trying to restrict access to the most seriously affected areas. Mayor James Knowles told KTVI-TV that police struggled to catch any looters because the crimes were so widespread. Deanel Trout, a 14-year resident of Ferguson, said he was convinced that the rioters were largely from outside Ferguson and that they had used the man's death and the vigil as an opportunity to steal. &quot;Most came here for a peaceful protest but it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch. ... I can understand the anger and unrest but I can't understand the violence and looting,&quot; Trout, 53, said. St Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said there were no reports of injuries but tear gas was used. The tensions erupted after a candlelight vigil on Sunday night for 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was shot multiple times on Saturday in a scuffle with an officer inside a patrol car. County Police Chief Jon Belmar said an officer encountered Brown and another man outside an apartment complex in Ferguson. One of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and they struggled. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who fought with the officer. The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said all shell casings matched the officer's gun. Police were investigating why the officer shot Brown, who was unarmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Zealand First party leader Winston Peters told his campaign launch in Auckland on Sunday that he wanted to tighten restrictions on foreign ownership, telling the audience; &quot;As they say in Beijing, two Wongs don't make a white.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comment was labelled &quot;disappointing and shameful&quot; by New Zealand's Race Relations Commissioner Susan Devoy, while the ACT Party accused Peters of inciting hatred against Chinese ahead of a general election on September 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr Peters may think it is funny to tell weak racist jokes but it is not funny to New Zealand's Chinese community,&quot; ACT deputy leader Kenneth Wang said. &quot;Every time Mr Peters stirs up anti-Chinese feeling he gives racists in the community encouragement to attack Chinese. I have reports of Chinese women being abused in the street [and] young louts going into Chinese shops to abuse shop keepers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peters, a long-standing anti-immigration campaigner who in the past has warned about New Zealand becoming an &quot;Asian colony&quot;, said his critics were lacking a sense of humour and claimed he was originally told the joke by a Chinese man in Beijing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A popular hashtag is #iftheygunnedmedown. Mostly being used by young African-Americans, each Twitter post with the hashtag shows two pictures. The first is something positive, such as a high school graduation, the poster flanked by relatives, diploma in hand; the other photo is more candid and shows a face enveloped by smoke or a swig from a bottle of whiskey. The point is the contrast, and the juxtaposition. Some of the images are graphic, but here are two that show the sentiment of the discussion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. -- The F.B.I. on Monday opened a civil rights inquiry into the fatal shooting by a police officer of an unarmed black teenager here as protests bubbled into a third night in this St. Louis suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers donned riot gear and warily faced off against hundreds of people in response to looting and violence on Sunday night that resulted in 32 arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday night, police officers using tear gas and rubber bullets tried to disperse the crowd of mostly African-Americans, who had been gathering through the day under the hot sun. The protesters questioned the role that race -- and simmering tensions between residents and the Police Department -- may have played in the killing of Michael Brown, 18, who was to start college this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The standoff lasted for more than an hour, with about a dozen men approaching officers with their hands up saying, ''Don't shoot me.'' At least 100 police officers were on the scene, shining bright lights into the crowd and telling people to return to their homes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, the sound of gunfire was heard from within the area where the police had barricaded streets in Ferguson. Earlier in the night, several people threw rocks at officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Thomas Jackson of the Ferguson police told The Associated Press that the officers used tear gas and shot ''beanbag rounds'' after members of the crowd threw rocks at officers and gunfire came from the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Jackson said the police blocked off the area where most of the looting and vandalism occurred Sunday night out of concern that cars passing by might hit demonstrators in the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Schellman, a public information officer with the St. Louis County police, said late Monday that the police had made several arrests for offenses including assaulting a police officer. He said they had no reports of injuries to the police or protesters. Officials have so far declined to identify the police officer who shot Mr. Brown or disclose his race. The officer was put on administrative leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You have to begin with the frustration,'' said one of the protesters, Wayne Bledsoe of St. Louis. ''Treatment of these communities is not equal. In white communities, the police truly protect and serve. In black communities, that is not the case.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation appeared to have calmed down by about 10:30 p.m. local time, the police said. A local news station aired footage of one man who was reportedly taken to a hospital for injuries from a rubber bullet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson, a city of 21,000 northwest of St. Louis, has shifted substantially over the last decade, with blacks, once a minority, now making up two-thirds of the residents, after many white families moved out to surrounding suburbs. The town's leadership and the police have remained predominantly white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2013, the suspension of a black superintendent of schools by an all-white school board stirred protests. And the Justice Department has a continuing investigation into racial disparities in legal representation for juveniles in Family Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The community is still highly segregated,'' said Karen Knodt, interim pastor of the Immanuel United Church of Christ, whose congregation has 800 members, only four of whom are black. ''The institutions of power don't yet reflect the changing demographics of the county.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference on Monday, Jon Belmar, the St. Louis County police chief, who said his department was asked by the Ferguson police to take over the investigation of the shooting, pleaded for the public's patience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I understand that the public has a right to be skeptical, and I appreciate that and I would expect that the public be skeptical oftentimes of government or some forms of it,'' he said. ''But I would also ask the public to be reasonable, because it takes a long time to make sure we do this investigation the right way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On social media, reaction to Mr. Brown's killing was fierce, with many accusing the police of again shooting an unarmed black youth. It included a Twitter campaign called ''IfTheyGunnedMeDown'' prompted by a photograph of Mr. Brown that was used in some news reports about his killing. In the photo, Mr. Brown is shown with fingers of his right hand extended in what some considered a peace sign, while others called it a gang sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown's parents said at a news conference that he was nonviolent and good-natured, and would have objected to the looting. Their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, compared the case to another one in which he represented a family, that of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old shot to death in Florida two years ago by a neighborhood watch coordinator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We need justice for our son,'' said Mr. Brown's father, Michael Brown, as his lawyer asked witnesses to step forward with testimony or videotape. ''If any of you have information, please give it to us,'' he said. ''We don't want no violence.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Because Michael wouldn't want no violence,'' said Lesley McSpadden, his mother, weeping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances of Mr. Brown's death on Saturday afternoon as he and a friend walked from a convenience store were disputed. The police said he had hit the officer who shot him; his family and friends denied that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a local television interview, the friend who was walking with him, Dorian Johnson, said the officer opened fire when the young men refused to move from the middle of the street to the sidewalk. He said Mr. Brown's hands were over his head. The autopsy showed Mr. Brown was shot a number of times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ferguson police said they do not have videocameras running in their patrol cars. Residents of Ferguson said they were shaken by the unrest that swept the town on Sunday night, bringing 500 officers to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One school district nearby canceled classes on Monday, citing safety concerns. Many businesses refused to open or boarded up their windows as a protective measure. On West Florissant Street, the aftermath of Sunday's protest was still visible in a burned-out convenience store, the smashed windows of a thrift shop and lottery tickets that littered a parking lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It was a miracle that no one was shot,'' Chief Belmar said of the looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the Police Department, groups of residents criticized the police but also condemned the looting from the night before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We don't want any more violence around here,'' said Carolyn Teague, a nurse, as she wiped away tears. The tension, she said, had one source: ''Prejudice in this town still lives on.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrice McHaskell, a teacher at a nursery school, said that in a town where the police force is mostly white and residents are mostly black, police officers have acquired a reputation for frequently stopping young black men, often for trivial things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting has tapped into longstanding resentments, she said: ''They're just outraged and they're tired of the police messing with them. It brought out all the anger and tension that everybody's been holding in.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. seemed to echo concerns from residents, saying in a statement on Monday that the episode ''deserves a fulsome review.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, ''Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department sometimes begins its own investigation into police departments that appear to show a pattern and practice of using excessive force, as it did this year in Albuquerque, after a series of shootings by the police involving people suffering from mental illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting mobilized supporters, including Cornell Williams Brooks, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., who flew into St. Louis on Monday. He said he was committed to seeking justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Note that he was nonviolent,'' he told reporters on Monday. ''If you want to honor his memory, honor his memory by seeking justice nonviolently.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlie Dooley, the St. Louis County executive, cautioned that the local investigation would not come to a quick conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is a difficult and complex situation,'' he said. ''There are many sides to the story. There are many answers.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The FBI said it will probe the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black teen just outside St. Louis - as angry residents and cops clashed Monday for a second night of rioting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Feds and St. Louis County police will both be investigating the slaying of Michael Brown, 18, by a Ferguson, Mo., city cop on Saturday night.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The FBI notified me that they will be opening up an investigation that will run parallel to this investigation,&quot; St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A petty sidewalk beef between police, Brown and a pal may have sparked the deadly confrontation and ensuing riots in Ferguson, about 12 miles northwest of St. Louis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Furious that an unarmed man had been shot to death in their community, demonstrators protested Brown's killing at a candlelight vigil on Sunday night. It turned ugly when looters broke into several shops and torched a convenience store.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tensions erupted in the St. Louis suburb again on Monday evening, when riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a large crowd of protestors. At least five people were arrested, according to St. Louis County police.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dorian Johnson told WALB-TV that the fatal trouble Saturday began after he and Brown had left a convenience store and were strolling in the street and an officer told them to get on the sidewalk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When they kept walking in the street, the officer rolled up to the pair, got out of the police car and drew his gun, Johnson said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officer fired, Johnson said, and they took off running. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We wasn't causing harm to nobody,&quot; Johnson added. &quot;We had no weapons on us at all.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cops have told a different story, saying one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car before the struggle began.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said a group that had gathered at a convenience store that had been torched on Sunday night started lobbing rocks at police on Monday evening. Cops also heard gunfire coming from the crowd and responded with tear gas.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The unrest first exploded after a Sunday night vigil to demonstrate against Brown's death, when looters hit a Walmart, Walgreens and Foot Locker, according to Belmar. Police arrested 32 suspected rioters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shots were fired at cops and a police helicopter, officials said, but no one was hit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It is a miracle, however, that no one actually got shot [Sunday] night,&quot; Belmar said. &quot;I was expecting the worst.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Rev. Al Sharpton will fly to Missouri and meet with Brown's family on Tuesday.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riviera Beach -- In the month that Chris Emmitt has lived in Riviera Beach, he's often been left to wonder if he resides in a war zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every day since I got here, I've heard gunshots at random times during the day or night or I'm getting news pop-ups on my phone about another shooting here and another shooting there,&quot; Emmitt said. &quot;It's all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's most recent spasm of violence occurred during a one-hour span Saturday when one man died and four other people were shot in three separate -- but related -- incidents, according to police. Riviera Beach Police Chief Clarence Williams said late Monday afternoon that suspects in the shooting have been identified as members of two rival gangs, and he expressed confidence that arrests will be made soon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know who they are and we're coming after them,&quot; Williams said. &quot;It's a game they can't win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unidentified man killed on Saturday was the sixth homicide victim this year in Riviera Beach. There were nine murders inside the city boundaries in all of 2013, according to a Palm Beach Post database.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence spilled over last week to nearby Mangonia Park, where three teenagers were found shot to death at the Hampton Court Apartments. No arrests have been made in that case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's something we deal with every week, every day,&quot; said Marie Jean-Pierre, founder of the Valley of Love Ministries, which caters primarily to Riviera Beach's homeless population. &quot;This is getting to be too much right now. It's got to stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scourge of violent crime is nothing new for Riviera Beach. In 2012, a national organization ranked the city as the 13th most dangerous in the U.S. That standing improved to 37th in 2013, but Riviera Beach was still listed as worse than cities with more notorious crime histories, including Washington D.C., Compton, Calif., and Newark, N.J.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riviera Beach officials said at the time that the numbers were incorrect because Neighborhood Scout, which compiled the rankings, used statistics from outside city limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roscoe McPhee, 43, has lived in Riviera Beach all his life and said he's been the victim of a couple of robberies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I put it on the parents,&quot; McPhee said. &quot;You have a younger generation out here who think they can do whatever they want. They have to be tougher on these kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams agrees, saying that if the city's crime trouble &quot;was purely about law enforcement, we would have this problem resolved by now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, a civil trial lawyer who served as Riviera Beach's mayor from 1999 to 2007, said the city will continue to suffer with violent crime issues as long as underlying factors such as poverty are ignored. Brown estimates that 40 to 50 percent of young men in Riviera Beach are unemployed, and that with limited employment prospects, many turn to illegal activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is asking, 'What's going on?'~HOA~128~128~&quot; Brown said. &quot;Well, you take any group of people anywhere who feel they have nothing to live for, have lost hope, have no aspirations and few dreams, this is what you get. I'm disappointed and saddened by it, but I'm not surprised by it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown said he's heard residents complaining that police are not doing enough, but he calls that sentiment misplaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's an emotional thing to say, 'What about the police?'~HOA~128~128~&quot; Brown said. &quot;But the police show up after something bad happens so the police is not the answer. The answer is to create jobs and opportunities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City officials said Monday there are developing plans to hold a &quot;peace rally&quot; this weekend to unite the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others point out that anti-violence marches have been held in Riviera Beach for years and not much has changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rallies are great to energize people and get them engaged,&quot; Williams said. &quot;The challenge is, what do we do after the rally?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON, Mo. - Police in riot gear fired tear gas into a crowd of protesters in a St. Louis suburb where an unarmed black teenager had been fatally shot by police over the weekend, as tension rose even amid calls for collective calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between two nights of unrest, a community forum hosted by the local NAACP chapter Monday night drew hundreds to a sweltering church in Ferguson, the nearly 70 percent black suburb where an unarmed 18-year-old, Michael Brown, was shot multiple times by a police officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said a large crowd that gathered throughout Monday at the site of a burned-out convenience store turned rowdy at nightfall, throwing rocks at police. Officers used tear gas and shot &quot;beanbag rounds&quot; meant to stun them, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said there were at least five arrests and no reports of looting. Nearly three dozen people were arrested following a candlelight vigil Sunday night when crowds burned stores, vandalized vehicles, assaulted reporters and taunted officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Floods slow auto production</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DETROIT - Record-setting rainfall in the Detroit area has slowed vehicle production and closed some facilities, automakers said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Motors closed its Tech Center in the Detroit suburb of Warren because of flood damage. The company told the 19,000 engineers, designers and others who work at the 330-acre campus to stay home while facilities are cleaned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GM spokesman Bill Grotz said the flooding didn't appear to cause severe damage to the historic campus, which was designed in the early 1950s by architect Eero Saarinen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GM said production at local plants wasn't affected. But flooding did cause slowdowns at Detroit's other two automakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four Chrysler plants - including one in Detroit and three in the suburbs of Warren and Sterling Heights - were flooded Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford also slowed production Monday at four suburban Detroit plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlantic City's newest casino closing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. - Atlantic City's newest casino is shutting its doors just over two years after opening amid high hopes of turning around the crumbling seaside resort's gambling market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revel Casino Hotel will shut down next month after failing to find a buyer in bankruptcy court, company officials announced today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company said the $2.4 billion casino will close its doors on Sept. 10. It has never turned a profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The closure will mean the loss of more than 3,100 jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sailors rescued near Hawaii</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HONOLULU - A container ship crew on Monday rescued three men who were stranded in a sailboat off the Hawaiian islands for about 24 hours as Hurricane Julio battered their vessel with giant waves and high winds that ripped off one of its hatches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sailors made it onto the container ship at about 8 a.m., Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Gene Maestas said. They were in good condition, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men got into trouble while sailing the 42-foot Walkabout from California to Hawaii, Warrant Officer Maestas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coast Guard said it received their message for help Sunday morning after the boat became disabled and started taking on water about 400 miles northeast of Oahu. The sailboat was stranded in 30-foot seas and winds of 92 to 115 mph, according to the agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rough conditions broke the vessel's mast, tossed its life raft overboard and blew off one of its hatches, worsening the flooding, Petty Officer 2nd Class Tara Molle said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coast Guard coordinated the rescue with the Matson Inc. container ship, which started out in Long Beach, Calif., and was on its way to Honolulu to deliver goods.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VIOLENT LOOTING broke out in a suburb of St Louis, Missouri, after anger over the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by police exploded on to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shops were ransacked by dozens of adults and children during the &quot;free for all&quot; as officers in riot gear used tear gas to arrest 32 people in the Ferguson suburb. A petrol station was also burned to the ground in the night of mayhem. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disturbance took place after the death of Michael Brown, 18, who, his family claim,  was shot dead for no reason while he walked to his grandmother's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was some of the most serious civil unrest in America this year and is the latest instance of a black person dying after an altercation with a white policeman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence flared on Sunday when thousands gathered for a peaceful prayer vigil for Brown during which they held up signs which read: &quot;No Justice&quot; as they stood face to face with watching officers. After a long hot day in the sun, things boiled over about 8:30pm. Ferguson police were overrun so called in 60 officers from neighbouring counties, including a SWAT team, which only got things under control in the early hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community leaders were quick to condemn the violence and Ferguson mayor James Knowles said: &quot;We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said: &quot;Anybody who is doing this kind of looting is not on my side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager's death had angered black residents in Ferguson, which is predominantly African American, because they already had a strained relationship with the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday morning Mr Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, wept as he attended a memorial service for the teenager and said: &quot;Ferguson killed my son. Ferguson flat-out murdered my son in the street, a cold-blooded murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Brown's death has also proved controversial because of the wildly differing accounts of what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witness Piaget Crenshaw, 19, said that she saw an officer trying to force Mr Brown into his squad car on Saturday and that the teenager then put his hands in the air. She watched as he tried to flee, but was shot several times by the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St Louis County police chief Jon Belmar said at a press conference that there was a struggle in the back of the officer's car and that a shot was fired, which led to the teenager's death.The unidentified officer has been placed on leave as an investigation continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, a white resident in Detroit was convicted of shooting an unarmed black woman who knocked on his door in the early hours of the morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the looters in Ferguson wore T-shirts bearing the name Trayvon Martin, a black teenager who was shot dead by a white neighbourhood watch co-ordinator in Florida. Benjamin Crump, a civil rights lawyer who represented Mr Martin's family, announced he would also be representing Mr Brown's relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney general Eric Holder has also asked civil rights lawyers in the US justice department to monitor the case. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media outlets from around the country are following the story about Michael Brown. A sample of their coverage:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LA TIMES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that Sunday night he was in protective gear in the parking lot outside Wal-Mart with Jon Belmar, the chief of St. Louis County police, when a car passed by, pointed a light at him and then he heard three gunshots. A shot was also fired at a police helicopter circling the area. No one was injured, Jackson said.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VIBE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Popular figureheads from Al Sharpton to Young Jeezy to Chingy have taken to social media to speak out against the trend of innocent African-Americans being killed by armed 'enforcers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOX.COM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The incident provoked immediate anger and frustration in the community and around the country. The killing of Eric Garner, also an unarmed black man, by New York City police last month revived a public conversation about the history of police violence against black men, and the killing of Brown has inflamed it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSNBC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shortly after Michael Brown was gunned down by police, an image of him wearing a red tank top, a serious face and throwing up two fingers, began circulating in the press. Social media users wondered whether the image had been selected to make Brown look intimidating, as a way of justifying the use of lethal force on an unarmed teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A competing image of Brown, looking shy and self-deprecating inside what appears to be some kind of arcade, began circulating as well. Black Twitter users began posting their own contrasting images of themselves under the hashtag #iftheygunnedmedown, exposing the shortcomings of reducing a human being to a single out of context picture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WONKBLOG, WASHINGTON POST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there's a much broader piece of context here that has to do with a legacy of racial segregation in U.S. cities, which has eroded more slowly in St. Louis than many other big metros. St. Louis remains among the most segregated metropolitan areas in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JIM ROMENESKO.COM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blog, which covers media news, published photographer David Carson's Facebook post about his experience covering looting and violence in Ferguson Sunday night.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS o The fact that Michael Brown was unarmed and possibly fleeing when a Ferguson police officer shot him does not necessarily mean the use of force was unjustified in the eyes of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As federal and local authorities begin investigating the case, the key question will be whether the officer had reason to believe Brown, 18, posed a threat - gun or no gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The courts, out of concern for public safety and recognizing the dangers of an officer's job, have traditionally given police a lot of latitude on that front, experts say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The federal courts are very clear that there are times and places where officers are allowed to shoot people in the back when they are running away, even if they are unarmed,&quot; said David Klinger, a criminal justice professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and expert on police shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klinger, a former police officer, pointed to the 1985 U.S. Supreme Court case, Tennessee vs. Garner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that case, two police officers responding to a burglary encountered a fleeing suspect and shot him dead as he tried to climb over a fence. The officer who fired had no reason to believe the suspect was armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 6-3 opinion, the court held that &quot;deadly force may not be used unless it is necessary to prevent the escape and the officer had probable cause to believe that the suspect posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the court ruled that the officer was wrong to shoot, because he was dealing with a nonviolent felon, the decision set out the circumstances by which deadly force is justified: when dealing with a violent felon who could harm the officer or others, Klinger said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Language from that case, in some variation, now appears in police manuals across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said in a news conference Sunday that Brown first pushed the Ferguson officer into his car and &quot;assaulted him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar said one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the car during the struggle, hitting no one, and that the officer then fired multiple times. Officials have refused to provide a more detailed account, pending further investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klinger said that if an investigation shows the earlier struggle did occur as described, even if Brown was fleeing, it could be grounds for justifying the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar has promised a thorough investigation into the shooting. Ed Magee, a spokesman for Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, said the office will be reviewing the case - as it does with all officer-involved shootings - for any potential criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, County Executive Charlie Dooley announced that the FBI will conduct its own investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI would be looking to see whether there was evidence the officer violated federal civil rights laws in his use of deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klinger said deadly force reviews differ across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors may be brought in from the start, or only at the request of the police department after its own review is finished. Some states have coroner's inquests. He said involvement from the FBI is rarer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson asked the FBI to review his officers' actions in the case of Cary Ball, 25, who was shot 21 times by police after a car chase on Sept. 27, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witness accounts had differed on whether Ball had a gun in his hand, and whether he was throwing it aside and surrendering when the shots were fired, or pointing it at officers as they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the department and the FBI cleared the officers in that case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Executive Charlie A. Dooley and county Police Chief Jon Belmar were absolutely correct on Monday to ask the FBI to help investigate the fatal shooting Saturday of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This process won't be quick, nor will it satisfy the understandable anger of those in Ferguson's African-American community who are enraged by Mr. Brown's killing. But getting it right is more important than getting it fast. As we've seen since Saturday afternoon, getting it fast often means getting it wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At midday Monday, the only thing known for sure was that Mr. Brown was unarmed and that he was shot multiple times as he was attempting to flee an encounter with an as-yet-unidentified police officer. That much alone is profoundly disturbing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Were he and a companion merely stopped for walking in the middle of the street in the 2900 block of Canfield Drive near West Florissant Avenue? Was the police officer shoved into his patrol car? Was there a struggle for the officer's weapon? Was there a gunshot in the car? This is the account offered by both the Ferguson and St. Louis County police departments, but eyewitness accounts differ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patience, in the face of what looks like a grievous injustice, is hard. But let's get it right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened Saturday night into Sunday in the wake of shooting cannot be excused. To say that burning and looting is somehow the proper response to a young man's death is to trivialize that death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advent of social media enabled people from thousands of miles away to weigh in on the events in Ferguson this weekend. The killing of an unarmed black kid by a cop, followed by looting and civil unrest, is a great opportunity for facile or inflammatory commentary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It does no disservice to the Ferguson and county police departments to say they were overwhelmed by the fast-breaking events. In a highly charged atmosphere, with random gunshots and flying rocks, officers in riot gear generally reacted professionally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ferguson officials and county police did a poor job of disseminating information. Rumor filled the gaps. The city and county police train for mass casualty events; if getting ahead of the information environment isn't a priority, it should be. In the county, with its five dozen law enforcement jurisdictions, some of which are barely competent, information flow is uneven at best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One lesson from this weekend is that the county must move quickly to centralize command and control for major emergencies. Fast, accurate information is part of that. It's harder now than ever before to do that, but even more critical.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The town of Ferguson, like much of north St. Louis County, was inching its way back after suffering heavily in the real estate and jobs collapse in the last decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came the conflagration of Sunday night. Now local residents are wondering if recent signs of economic hope could vanish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those signs included a rapidly falling number of home foreclosures in North County. Real estate agents in Ferguson and some nearby towns saw signs that prices were stabilizing, or even rising in some neighborhoods. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson city government had spruced up its little downtown along Florissant Road. It became a local destination with a wine bar, brew pub and restaurants. Business seemed to be looking up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The town dangled subsidies in front of new college graduates to get them to buy houses in town, and launched a lending program for home repairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone was very optimistic,&quot; said Carolyn Marty, president of the Greater North County Chamber of Commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Michael Brown, an unarmed teen, was shot to death by a Ferguson police officer. Crowds took to the streets in protest. On Sunday night, looting and arson broke out on West Florissant Avenue, hitting many businesses in neighboring Dellwood, leaving neighbors and business owners to wonder what comes next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was just devastated. Everybody worked so hard to get North County growing. Everything people were doing for years could be defeated with just one pop of the balloon,&quot; said Carol O'Mara, director of housing in Florissant, Ferguson's northern neighbor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson, population 21,000, is a town of diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have century homes - three-story houses on big lots. We have houses for first-time homebuyers, houses for the middle class, to the upper end,&quot; says Rory Schwartz, who has sold Ferguson houses for 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of Ferguson is a picture of pleasant suburbia, with trees lining streets in front of tract houses built during the 1950s and 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it has a mix of housing, Ferguson is mainly a blue-collar town and somewhat poorer than the rest of the region. Median family income was $44,000 in 2012, compared with $75,000 in St. Louis County as a whole and $59,000 for the state of Missouri. The town had a poverty rate of 20 percent, according to the census, compared to 7.8 percent for the county as a whole and 10.7 percent in Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like much of North County, Ferguson has also undergone a racial transition, from 52 percent black in 2000 to 66 percent in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some worry that TV images of buildings burning could have a psychological impact, damaging business and the housing market in Ferguson and surrounding towns. Reggie Bomar, a real estate agent and landlord with property in Ferguson, worries that people may decide to leave. &quot;If my neighborhood is this explosive, do I get out of here?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, scenes of looting could fade into memory if future protests are peaceful. &quot;I hope it's not long-lasting, for Ferguson's sake,&quot; said Bomar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's disturbance came against a recent history of financial distress that altered neighborhoods in parts of North County. The Great Recession and housing bust hit the area particularly hard, both in jobs and in housing, and Ferguson was no exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of March, the typical house in Ferguson was worth 37 percent less than at its peak in 2007, according to the Zillow housing sales website. The region as a whole was down 15 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson's situation is fairly typical for North County. Economist Bill Rogers at the University of Missouri-St. Louis calculates that a house in most of St. Louis County would be worth roughly half as much if moved to the Ferguson-Florissant School District. It would lose roughly 60 percent of its value in the North County school districts of Normandy, Jennings or Riverview Gardens. Those gaps have been widening since the recession six years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than the rest of the region, North County suffered from a seven-year run of home foreclosures that saw thousands of homeowners become renters and thousands of homes go from occupant-owned to rental property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But foreclosures are fading fast. Less than 1 percent of Ferguson houses and apartments units were in foreclosure in the first half of this year, down from 5 percent in 2008, according to RealtyTrac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fewer cheap foreclosures on the market has given rise to hope that prices may finally start rising again. &quot;We've been seeing a little bit of an uptick in Ferguson, Florissant and Hazelwood,&quot; said Rebecca Zoll, who heads North County Incorporated, the regional economic development group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no good estimates of unemployment for suburban towns. But North County maintains a good employment base. Emerson, a global manufacturer on the Fortune 500 list, is based in Ferguson. Boeing, Express Scripts, the University of Missouri-St. Louis and Mallinckrodt are among big employers producing a $7 billion annual payroll in North County, according to a University of Missouri analysis. Still, the number of jobs has declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson's municipal government fought back with redevelopment programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the past few years, they've done remarkably well,&quot; Zoll said. &quot;They had lots of new restaurants that opened and housing above the restaurants. Lots of businesses are doing very well in Ferguson right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, St. Louis faith leaders are hoping to lead the charge in de-escalating racial tension and rebuilding trust in Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One step toward that goal will take place tonight, when the Rev. Traci D. Blackmon will host a forum at 7 p.m. at Christ the King United Church of Christ. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson and Mayor James Knowles III are expected to be on hand to answer questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blackmon, pastor at Christ the King in Florissant, is organizing the forum after submitting a petition with about 480 signatures to the Ferguson Police Department that called on officers to immediately engage with the community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what is at the core of this is fear,&quot; said Blackmon, adding that she was not ready to vilify the Ferguson Police Department. &quot;What an African-American male represents is fear, and our fear causes us to react irrationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes there's justified fear on both sides, but how do we stop it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blackmon said she had been in contact with Michael Brown's family, praying twice with Michael's mother, Lesley McSpadden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blackmon hopes that, in addition to civic and faith leaders, those who feel most disenfranchised in Ferguson will attend the forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hear people saying, 'See me, hear me, I'm not invisible,'&quot; Blackmon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a small group of individuals that tend to take advantage of the situation and make it worse,&quot; Blackmon said, referring to Sunday's night looting in Ferguson. &quot;We want to go in a positive direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rodney Francis, senior pastor at Washington Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church, said the &quot;main concern is how we can prevent interactions with unarmed citizens from ending with a homicide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to know what kind of training officers are being given to de-escalate,&quot; a situation, Francis said. Police need to &quot;respect that everyone in the community is not a criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A range of church leaders are expected to attend Tuesday's forum, including representatives from the St. Louis Metropolitan Clergy Coalition, the United Church of Christ, Central Reform Congregation and the Rev. Michael Kinman of Christ Church Cathedral, an Episcopal church in St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sermon on Sunday, Kinman spoke about the death of Brown, noting that although some of the facts of the case were unknown, the community realizes there are &quot;too many guns on our streets... that there are deep divides of race and class... that these divides continue to bring us nothing but misery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Show us that this storm, of whom Michael Brown is only the latest victim, is not more powerful than God and God's people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were born to walk on water. We can do impossible things,&quot; Kinman said to his congregation, referring to Jesus walking on water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By today, the Rev. Al Sharpton, a New York-based civil rights leader, is also expected to arrive in St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said, at the request of the Brown family, he was flying to St. Louis to &quot;work with groups in the area as we pursue justice in the tradition of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Anderson, president of 100 Black Men of Metropolitan St. Louis, a nonprofit group that aims to educate and empower young African-Americans, said church leaders have always played an important role in leading a community out of civil unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;History tells us the church has been at the forefront of moving social issues forward,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;We do believe prayer is a piece of change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson said the forum would attempt to sort out the frustration in the African-American community that has been building for years but over the weekend was released &quot;like a bottle cork that just busted.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUSON o Tension stayed high and raw Monday as the St. Louis region waited for answers in the fatal shooting of an unarmed teenager by a municipal police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another day of fast-moving events, the FBI promised to investigate the killing of Michael Brown, 18, on Saturday by a Ferguson police officer. Brown's parents called for an end to the violence while strongly disputing the police version of their son's death. More than 1,000 people observed a moment of silence at a meeting called by the NAACP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the day, protesters continued to face off with police, and as the sun set, lines of police in riot gear fired tear gas to disperse protesters, telling them it was time to go home. By midnight, the situation was quiet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Police and the FBI promised thorough investigations into the shooting of Brown outside an apartment complex in the 2900 block of Canfield Drive. The address is just east of a stretch of West Florissant Avenue, in the eastern corner of Ferguson, that was the focus of violence and looting Sunday night after a day of peaceful protest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police fired the tear gas into an increasingly unruly crowd that had reformed near the QuikTrip at 9240 West Florissant Avenue, looted and torched Sunday. The gutted store was ground zero for protests all day Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police, backed by a SWAT armored car, blocked both West Florissant and the entry to Canfield Drive, scene of the killing on Saturday afternoon that touched off the protests and violence. All but a few protesters had retreated from the scene by 9 p.m., and police held their positions in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two miles to the south, an overflow crowd observed a moment of silence at Murchison Tabernacle CME Church, 7629 Natural Bridge Road in Normandy. Cornell Brooks, the new national president of the NAACP, pleaded for calm as the community responds to the &quot;unfolding drama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martin Luther King did not live and die so that we might steal in the name of justice in the middle of the night,&quot; said Brooks, who flew to St. Louis for the gathering, sponsored by the organization's St. Louis County branch. The shooting and rioting have drawn international attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damage from Sunday night and early Monday was most extensive on West Florissant, but it also jumped two miles north to commercial areas near Interstate 270, where a Walmart was among retailers hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven miles south of the scene, several retailers in Brentwood closed their doors early Monday evening. &quot;We didn't want to take any chances,&quot; said a security guard at the Brentwood Promenade. The Galleria mall also closed early after a few girls got into a fight. Authorities said the fight was not related to Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests formed and reformed all day Monday outside the gutted QuikTrip. Marchers chanted and held up their hands in a mock sign of surrender as police hovered nearby. West Florissant was crowded with horn-honking gawkers in cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, protesters gathered outside the Ferguson police station, 222 South Florissant Road, to the west of West Florissant. More than 150 people took part, also holding up their hands and shouting, &quot;Hands up, don't shoot,&quot; and &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the scene of the shooting, where a growing pile of teddy bears marked the spot, a man in a white T-shirt fired a handgun Monday afternoon. Police did not respond to the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., 36, was surveying the mound of bears when the shots were fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just need justice for my son, get this case solved. I need everybody to come together to get this done,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 5 p.m., honking and yelling continued outside the QuikTrip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It feels like I am at a historical moment,&quot; said Armaon Simmons, 17, of the Normandy area. &quot;Black people are coming together. We aren't killing each other; we are working as one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zackery Keys, an African-American and union carpenter from St. Louis County, saw it differently. &quot;This is a disturbed group of young people,&quot; said Keys, 58, from a safe distance. &quot;This is nothing to be proud of. Who wants to be part of chaos? ... Probably 95 percent of these people don't even vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said they made no more than 10 arrests Monday, mostly for peace disturbance. In contrast, there were 32 arrests Sunday, leading Monday to charges against 10 suspects. St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch said the 10 were all &quot;well-known&quot; to investigators. Police officials and political leaders appealed for calm. St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley announced the FBI involvement during a news conference in Clayton. The St. Louis County NAACP branch and numerous elected officials had called for the FBI to step in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dooley promised the process would be open but not quick. &quot;We're asking all the public to be calm, be patient,&quot; Dooley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the FBI &quot;will take a lot of the information we have developed already through our investigation. They will take that investigation, and they may do their own interviews and take a look at the evidence themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will share our information with Prosecutor McCulloch's office and at the same time with the FBI,&quot; Belmar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar said Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson contacted him Saturday even before he got to the scene of the shooting. &quot;This is a complex investigation, as it should be,&quot; Belmar added. &quot;We need to make sure everything's done right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said investigators still need to talk to scores of people at the apartment complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand the public has a right to be skeptical,&quot; Belmar said. &quot;But I would also ask the public to be reasonable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police did not release the name or race of the police officer, who was put on leave. Belmar said Sunday the officer had an encounter with two people and that Brown pushed the officer inside his police vehicle. Belmar said one shot was fired in the car. He said the officer fired multiple shots at Brown, who was away from the car, killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members and some witnesses disputed the police account. They say Brown had his hands up in surrender when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division will take part in what he called a &quot;concurrent federal inquiry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The federal investigation will supplement, rather than supplant, the inquiry by local authorities,&quot; Holder said. &quot;At every step, we will work with the local investigators, who should be prepared to complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The county NAACP and the African-American Mound City Bar Association released a joint statement urging witnesses to come forward. The statement said it was &quot;clear that there were many witnesses who had not yet been interviewed by police investigators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They promised to provide free legal counsel to witnesses who come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Rev. Al Sharpton, of the National Action Network, said he would visit Ferguson today to meet with the victim's family and community leaders, and hold a news conference. At 7 p.m. today, the Rev. Traci D. Blackmon will host a forum at Christ the King United Church of Christ, 11370 Old Halls Ferry Road, where Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III and Police Chief Jackson were expected to be on hand to answer questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On West Florissant Monday, shopkeepers and employees swept debris and boarded up windows, raising sheets of plywood from trucks parked throughout the area. Not all the windows had been smashed - businesses were guarding against another round of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for QuikTrip said employees of the burned store were transferred to other locations, and that the company hadn't decided whether to rebuild. A Walmart spokesman said it would keep its Ferguson store closed for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ferguson-Florissant School District canceled meetings scheduled for Monday evening at eight elementary schools that would have allowed parents and students to meet teachers and visit classrooms. School is to begin Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are heartbroken by the tragic events of recent days in and around the City of Ferguson,&quot; administrators wrote on the district website. &quot;We are planning to receive and support our students when school begins this Thursday, and we look forward to working closely with our community to heal and rebuild.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jennings School District, just east of the apartments on Canfield, canceled the first day of school Monday. &quot;Safety is our uppermost concern,&quot; according to a district news release. &quot;At this time we do not feel it's safe for our students to walk to school.&quot; Classes were scheduled to begin today, according to the district website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the QuikTrip, one man who claimed to have taken part late Sunday sought to justify the violence. But other citizens dropped by to decry the mayhem and to urge businesses to continue serving the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leonette Hilliard, a middle school English teacher, wrote a note to the store and taped it onto the side wall saying, &quot;Corporate neighbor: I am sorry this act of robbery and violence has happened. Please return soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She taped it across graffiti saying &quot;187 county police,&quot; the 187 being a slang reference to murder. Hilliard said she comes to the store to two or three times a week and has been doing so for about 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This just doesn't represent who we are as a community and I wanted just to say something to do something that was productive,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar said Monday that officers originally were deployed the night before so protesters had an &quot;opportunity to vent, but at some point we could no longer sustain that attitude.&quot; He said they moved to police cars to become more mobile as departments received numerous calls for shots fired, vandalism, burglary and assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a miracle, however, that nobody actually got shot (Sunday) night,&quot; Belmar said. &quot;I was expecting the worst. You can never tell, when you're in an environment like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown's parents on Monday emphatically rejected police accounts of their son's fatal shooting by an unnamed officer on Saturday, calling on witnesses to step forward with information that would cast doubt on law enforcement's version of events. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking through their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, the family said the 18-year-old, whom teachers described as a &quot;gentle giant,&quot; didn't have the personality to try and wrestle away an officer's gun, as police have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This family &quot;expects and demands and will not sleep until they get the truth,&quot; Crump said during a Monday news conference at Jennings Mason Temple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are a witness to what happened, don't be intimidated, come forward,&quot; Crump said. &quot;People from the U.S. Department of Justice will take statements without any intimidation or fear of retribution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump wouldn't say what the family believed happened, but said witness accounts relayed to them have cast serious doubt on what police are describing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think it'll be very clear when this is over,&quot; the civil rights lawyer said. Crump is known for representing the family of Florida shooting victim Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's parents also used the event to request that all demonstrations done in their son's honor be nonviolent. The plea came less than 24 hours after a night of unrest .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a good boy. He didn't deserve none of this,&quot; Michael Brown Sr., said. &quot;We want justice for our son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With no violence,&quot; the teen's mother, Lesley McSpadden, added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She later noted that her son was scheduled to start college this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't even celebrate him going to college,&quot; she said. &quot;Now we've got to plan his funeral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mood at Monday's news conference ranged from fiery to somber, on the second day since the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities have maintained that a police officer shot Brown, who was unarmed, after the teen attacked the Ferguson officer. Witnesses have said the officer fired multiple shots at Brown while the teen had his hands in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's news conference was supposed to be a chance for Brown's parents to speak publicly. His mother, however, was overcome with tears as she held a photo of her child and was unable to speak more than a few words at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's father, was also visibly shaken throughout the afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump, the lawyer, did most of the talking, calling Brown's killing an execution, and making reference to other young black men from around the country that have been killed by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the news conference, Brown's mother made her way outside the church, where she was consoled by family, requesting that reporters and onlookers give her time to grieve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump, however, pressed her to come back inside the church for an interview with a cable news station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funeral details for Brown have not been released.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was an eerie flashback to 1965 in parts of the St. Louis region Sunday. Riot gear. Tear gas. Looting. Stores on fire. Dozens arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the violent aftermath of a violent encounter the day before between a police officer and teenager Michael Brown, who was killed. The turmoil came a day short of the anniversary of the Watts riots in Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to explain race relations within the St. Louis area to those who have never lived here. It's even harder to make sense of it for children being reared in a more diverse and multiracial America than ever before. It's important to consider our recent past. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis, recently ranked as the sixth-most racially segregated city in the country, has entrenched polarized attitudes about race and law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson, a community of about 21,000, is an inner-ring suburb, a place where it's easy for the economic recovery to bypass the poor. It's a city of 6 square miles, about 10 miles north of downtown. About two-thirds of the residents are African-American. The median income in 2012 was $44,000, roughly $15,000 less than the state average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a part of the county where whites left en masse beginning a few decades ago. In the 1950s, they began rapidly leaving north St. Louis, creating one of the most extreme cases of &quot;white flight&quot; in the country. But many who remained in power are white, including much of law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The images from the day before were tinder for this fire: A young black man with his hands in the air. The graphic photo, widely circulated, of Brown slain, lying on the street. His stepfather holding a sign saying the police executed his son. Social media ablaze with photos, videos and outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's family members have said the destruction in their hometown is salt in their wounds. When peaceful protests turn to a city's self-immolation, there is no justice for anyone. What's left is a community used to being unheard, roiling in the wake of a deadly police shooting. A powder keg of unemployment and poverty, of neglect and frustration, and those willing to exploit a tragedy for personal gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When an unarmed black teenager is fatally shot, there are questions any mother, any citizen will have:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">o Why did Brown's uncovered, slain body lie on the ground for four hours?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">o Why did an officer, as yet unidentified, repeatedly fire shots when Brown didn't have a gun and had run away?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">o What happened in that police car?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These answers will take time to uncover. The explanation offered from police officials thus far, that Brown struggled for the officer's gun, seems so at odds with the descriptions of a gentle kid, who was relieved to graduate high school and wanted to start a better life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interaction, the exchange between a young black man and police officer in that neighborhood, will be understood completely differently, given the individual's personal life experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those who have been on the receiving end of disrespect, mistrust, suspicion or brutality, the impulse is to believe Brown was brutally gunned down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those who are fearful any time they cross into the city limits, most likely only for a sporting event, the young man must have done something wrong. These perspectives largely fall along racial lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a false dichotomy, a lazy narrative, to see this region as divided among racist whites and angry blacks. That's not reality in many neighborhoods and families here. But it's the loudest, most visible part of the discourse. Like much of America, St. Louis has an undeniable problem talking about or dealing with issues involving race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until we can tell our children - and ourselves - a more honest story about race in this region, we will be left with far worse tragedies to explain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON: Protesters clashed with police and looted stores in a suburb of St Louis after an officer shot dead an unarmed black teen, local media reported yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police armed with clubs hurled teargas and deployed officers with dogs to curb the violence that erupted late on Sunday in Ferguson, in the Midwestern state of Missouri. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But local law enforcement officers were quickly overwhelmed and had to urgently call for back-up from nearby communities, according to KSDK TV 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A video posted by the St Louis Post-Dispatch showed a service station convenience store plundered and set on fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looters also raided a Walmart and several other smaller stores, and set fires elsewhere, the newspaper reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence broke out after large crowds of mostly African-American protesters gathered on Sunday for a vigil at the spot where 18-year-old Michael Brown died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of Brown's death differ. A witness told KMOV News 4 that he was walking with Brown when a police officer confronted them and drew his weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer shot Brown, who &quot;turned around and put his hands in the air&quot;, Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He started to get down and the officer still approached and fired several more shots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, however, said Brown was killed after physically assaulting a police officer and struggling to get his weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belmar did not say whether the officer was white, but the Post-Dispatch said the incident brings to light the tension between the mostly white local police force and the African-American community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St Louis County chapter of the NAACP civil rights group said it had launched an investigation and called for a meeting yesterday &quot;in response to the recent murder of Mike Brown&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's grief-stricken mother, Lesley McSpadden, told KMOV TV that her son had just graduated from high school and planned to attend college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Not many,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because you bring them down to this type of level, where they feel like they don't got nothing to live for anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's family have hired attorney Benjamin Crump to represent them, the Post-Dispatch said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump is the lawyer who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the black teen shot and killed in Florida by George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watchman, in February 2012. - Sapa-AFP</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brown, 18, was killed in the largely black St. Louis suburb on Saturday afternoon after what officers said was a struggle with a gun in a police car. The FBI opened an investigation into the racially charged case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's family has hired an attorney who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager whose fatal shooting by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012 triggered nationwide protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He just graduated and was on his way to college,&quot; said Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, speaking through tears at a news conference on Monday, which would have been her first-born son's first day at school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She called for calm, but demonstrations demanding the arrest and conviction of the police officer turned violent. Fire trucks, ambulances and more officers converged on the area in a chaotic scene. One officer in riot gear stood behind a squad car in a standoff with a group of young demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds, driven out of one area by tear gas gathered outside a police station chanting &quot;Hands up, don't shoot&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We aren't going to let this one go,&quot; said 18-year-old Dreya Harris, of St. Louis. &quot;People feel like in the Trayvon Martin case that there was no justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other demonstrators had photographs that appeared to show Brown's body lying on the street and shot videos of the confrontations with their mobile phones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are throwing bottles, coins, rocks at the police ... That's why the tear gas has been deployed,&quot; St. Louis County Police Department spokesman Brian Schellman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 50 people have been arrested by early Tuesday morning, said police and local media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday night, crowds broke car and shop windows, set fire to one building and looted shops. At least two dozen businesses were damaged, 32 people were arrested, and two police officers were injured, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;WE NEED JUSTICE&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI inquiry, opened on Monday, would supplement the main investigation by St. Louis County police, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer involved in the shooting, who was not identified, is a six-year veteran and has been put on administrative leave, police said. The officer's race has not been disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not immediately clear from police why Brown was in the police car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness in the case told local media Brown had raised his arms to police to show he was unarmed before being killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's mother said her son had been planning to study heating and air conditioning repair at a technical college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need justice for our son,&quot; said Michael Brown Sr., the teen's father, who told reporters his son was &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;could make you laugh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the Ferguson Police Department's 53 members are black, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said. About two-thirds of Ferguson's 21,000-strong population are black, according to U.S. Census figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the communities around Ferguson have gone from white to mostly black in the last 40 years, said Terry Jones, political science professor at University of Missouri-St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a long history of racial injustice,&quot; said Jones. &quot;Slowly and not so surely, the St. Louis metropolitan area has been trying to figure out a way forward. As the Michael Brown shooting indicates, there are often setbacks.&quot;<BR>HU</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions between the authorities and minority groups in a city in midwest America reached a new high after police shot dead an unarmed black man, sparking riots and looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St Louis, Missouri, was counting the cost of Sunday night's rioting, which saw a convenience store pillaged and burnt and a clothes store, mobile phone shop and branch of Walmart robbed by armed and masked men taking advantage of the tension. Thirty two people were arrested. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Knowles, the mayor of the predominantly black suburb of Ferguson, appeared on local television to say that a peaceful protest planned for last night had been cancelled and that any people who gathered would be arrested. &quot;Last night, everything lost control,&quot; he said. &quot;Right now, the small group of people are creating a huge mess. Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violent scenes followed an uneasy stand-off outside a local police station after Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of his death are still not clear, but Mr Brown and a friend were said to have been involved in a scuffle with a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Jon Belmar, the police chief, the officer involved was pushed back into his patrol car by Mr Brown or the other youth. A shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the car. The scuffle spilled into the street and Mr Brown was shot several times about 35ft from the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said that the incident appeared to have started when the officer objected to the pair walking down the middle of the street. After a verbal confrontation, the officer was reportedly trying to get Mr Brown into his car when the scuffle began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Piaget Crenshaw, 18, said that the officer fired as the teenagers ran away. She said Mr Brown turned and held up his hands to show that he was unarmed but was hit by two more shots and died in the street. The officer has been suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Brown's family have enlisted the lawyer who acted for the family of Trayvon Martin, the teenagershot dead in Florida in 2012 by security guard George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That case, which ended with a jury clearing Mr Zimmerman of murder, led to a period of soul-searching about the way in which the US justice system treated young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Trayvon Martin case did not lead to scenes of unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's sluggish economic recovery has left St Louis lagging behind, and Mr Brown lived in a suburb that has more deprivation than elsewhere in the city. He had been due to start at a local college yesterday. His mother, Lesley McSpadden, who learnt of his death when she was sent a picture of him lying in the street, said: &quot;Do you know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Not many. Because you bring them down to this type of level, where they feel like they don't got nothing to live for anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Clark, vice president of the St Louis charity Better Family Life, said: &quot;We have neglected the urban areas for decades now, so you have individuals who are tired, angry, frustrated and who have a very short fuse. After the dust settles, we need to develop strong, aggressive outreach programmes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers in riot gear lobbed tear gas Monday night at crowds angered by the weekend shooting of an 18-year-old unarmed man by a police officer, according to published reports. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KSDK-TV in St. Louis reported that police officers trying to quell unrest and violence began firing tear gas at crowds here. There are no reports yet of injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities blocked access to many areas of Ferguson where the unrest has been building, the Associated Press reported. KTVI-TV also reported that police in riot gear were using tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters. It said there were reports of rubber bullets being fired. KMOV-TV said the tear gas was being fired at people gathering near a major intersection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday night, two police officers were injured and 32 arrested during riots. Demands for answers in Ferguson have been steadily growing louder after police fatally shot Michael Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI opened an investigation Monday into the death of Brown, who police said was shot multiple times Saturday after being confronted by an officer in Ferguson, a suburb of 21,000 that's nearly 70% black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities were vague about exactly what led the officer to open fire, except to say that the shooting was preceded by a scuffle of some kind with a man. It was unclear whether Brown or the man he was with was involved in the altercation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators refused to disclose the race of the officer, who is now on administrative leave. But Phillip Walker said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Brown on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A protest in front of St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch's office is scheduled for Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Tom Jackson with Ferguson police told KSDK said earlier in the day that peaceful demonstrators are allowed to protest, but if rioting begins, the crowds would be disbanded by police. Jackson has said his department is receiving threatening phone calls and emails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's family has retained attorney Benjamin Crump, best known as the attorney for the family of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teen shot and killed by George Zimmerman, a white neighborhood watch volunteer, in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to sugarcoat it; their baby was executed in broad daylight,&quot; said Crump, who stood by Brown's parents during a press conference Monday night. &quot;We want to know and see exactly what happened because this family rejects what the police authorities said at their press conference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump went on to say that Brown's death is an echo of the problems that led to the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Jordan Davis and Eric Garner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Common Dreams has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal police shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Missouri resident Michael Brown ignited protests in his hometown of Ferguson late Sunday night that continued into Monday morning and afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents held a vigil for Brown in the St. Louis suburb where he died after a police officer shot him 10 times Saturday night. His body was left in the street for four hours before being removed. The FBI officially launched a civil rights investigation into his death Monday afternoon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in riot gear surrounded the peaceful memorial, armed with shotguns and tear gas. Some held attack dogs on leashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vigil transitioned into a demonstration. Residents chanted, &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; as they marched through the neighborhood amid hundreds of police officers. Some held their hands up to show they were unarmed: &quot;Don't shoot me,&quot; they shouted. Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told reporters, &quot;My son just turned 18 and graduated high school and he didn't bother nobody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, held a sign that read, &quot;Ferguson Police Just Executed My Unarmed Son!!!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the police department, Brown was killed after he was stopped by an officer while walking with a friend to his grandmother's house. While the department has yet to release an official report, county police chief Jon Belmar immediately claimed that one of the young men had instigated the officer by pushing him back into his cruiser, where the first shot was fired. The claim will be hard to verify, as police vehicles in Ferguson are generally not installed with dashboard cameras, and while the department has purchased mobile cameras meant to be worn on police uniforms, they have yet to be put to use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;struggle&quot; between Brown and the officer allegedly spilled into the street, where Brown was killed. Belmar confirmed that the bullets matched the officer's gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian Johnson, the friend who was with Brown at the time of the confrontation, told reporters a different story -- that the officer who stopped them assaulted Brown, choking him while trying to pull him into the squad car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He shot again and once my friend felt that shot he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down,&quot; Johnson said, &quot;and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wasn't causing no harm to nobody,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;We had no weapons on us at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing is certain about Brown's death. It was another incident of police violence against a young black man in an area with a disproportionately high rate of racial profiling and police brutality, even in a town as small as Ferguson, a predominantly black city with a population of 21,203. As the St. Louis Post Dispatch notes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Black Missourians were 66 percent more likely in 2013 to be stopped by police, and blacks and Hispanics were both more likely to be searched, even though the likelihood of finding contraband was higher among whites... In Ferguson, the city where Michael died, the police in 2013 pulled over blacks at a 37 percent higher rate than whites compared to their relative populations. Black drivers were twice as likely to be searched and twice as likely to be arrested compared to white drivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming on the heels of Eric Garner's death at the hands of the NYPD, which itself came shortly after Florida resident George Zimmerman was acquitted for the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, Brown's death continues the trend of tragic, violent, racially motivated killings of unarmed black men in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Martin, Brown was an unarmed teenager. Like Garner, he was remembered by friends as a &quot;gentle giant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,&quot; said John Gaskin, a board member of the St. Louis NAACP. &quot;With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers ... this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raquan Smith, a friend and classmate of Brown's, spoke with the St. Louis Post Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;This is a problem,&quot; Smith said. &quot;This is an unfortunate recurring problem. We as a race, we as a community, we as a youth need to step up and say, 'Things need to change.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown, who was ready to start college orientation today, wrote a message to a friend on Facebook last week: &quot;if i leave this earth today, atleast youll know i care about others more then i cared about my damn self.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the protests continued into the night on Sunday, vandalism and looting were reported. Some stores in the area were broken into and police cars had their windows smashed. No injuries were reported. On Monday, after the overnight disturbances quieted down, protesters returned to the streets, marching to Ferguson's City Hall and police station to demand justice. Antonio French, alderman of the 21st ward that includes Ferguson, live-tweeted the events.</SPAN></P>
