With this opening salvo, the Asian Law Journal (now the Asian American Law Journal) launched only the second law journal in the United States dedicated to Asian American Jurisprudence.  ... Chang was the keynote speaker.  ... In this article, Lisa Takeuchi Cullen talks about the exit polls after the primary in California where Senator Clinton got the Asian American vote by a three to one margin over Senator Obama.  ... The New Republic in February had a commentary titled, &quot;Asian Alienation: Why Did Asian Americans Vote So Overwhelmingly Against Barack Obama?&quot; ... Even if one accounts for only 43 percent of the adult population voting, given that the margin of victory could be tens of votes or even a few thousand votes, the Asian American vote could make a difference in these battleground states, especially in presidential elections because of the way the winner in almost every state gets all of the state's electoral college votes.  ... Yang discusses Obama's childhood years in Hawaii and Indonesia and talks about his multiracial family, eventually distilling his values as traditional Asian American values.  ... Jerome was struck by that moment, how a complete stranger felt a connection to him based on race that allowed him to take pride in Jerome's accomplishment.  ... Can I take pride in the success of Barack Obama?  ... This kind of racial shame demonstrates a kind of connection, and this makes me wonder: is there a way to think about and explore this idea of racial shame to then be able to feel more strongly this kind of pride?  ... How do we engage in coalition building that moves beyond issue-specific organizing, that would allow for feelings of solidarity, that brings about deep identification with those who are not us so that we can, as Jerome Culp has said, participate in the struggles of those who are not ourselves?  ... I find this question particularly vexing because I've spent much of my academic career talking about where Asian Americans fit within America's racial landscape, a landscape dominated by the black-white racial paradigm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c5">HIGHLIGHT: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1993, the Asian Law Journal published its inaugural issue, featuring its first article entitled &quot;Toward an Asian American Legal Scholarship: Critical Race Theory, Post-structuralism, and Narrative Space.&quot; 81 Calif. L. Rev. 1241 (1993);&nbsp;1 Asian L.J. 1 (1993). With this opening salvo, the Asian Law Journal (now the Asian American Law Journal) launched only the second law journal in the United States dedicated to Asian American Jurisprudence. The author of this landmark article is none other than Professor Robert S. Chang, one of the most recognized figures in Asian American Jurisprudence and Critical Race Theory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To celebrate the fifteen years since the publication of the inaugural issue and this landmark article, the Asian American Law Journal held its Fifteenth Anniversary Dinner on October 18, 2008. Professor Robert S. Chang was the keynote speaker. What follows is Professor Chang's keynote address, delivered two weeks before the historic 2008 presidential election.<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c5"> TEXT:<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*205]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good evening. Let me join in congratulating you on this 15th anniversary. It really marks a testament to the vision and the work of all the editors and all the staff members throughout the years. I am especially thankful for the opportunities that you have given me over the years, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and am honored to be with you today to help you celebrate your 15th year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*206]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We stand on the cusp of a historic election, a moment when we might see the election of our first black president. As a member of a racial minority that has experienced a long history of discrimination and one who has worked in coalition with other racial groups during my entire career, I feel that there's something about this moment that I can share in. There's a feeling of tremendous excitement and hope, a feeling that on the horizon there is change that we need, change we can believe in, a feeling that yes, indeed, we can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet this is also a moment from which I feel excluded. I think my ambivalence stems from the way that racial pride and racial shame operate, along with questions about where Asian Americans fit in the racial and post-racial America. Much of this feeling has to do with a realization that Asian Americans have been largely invisible during this election. When we have been discussed by the mainstream media, much of it has focused on conflict. For instance, Time magazine in February had a headline that read: &quot;Does Obama have an Asian problem?&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this article, Lisa Takeuchi Cullen talks about the exit polls after the primary in California where Senator Clinton got the Asian American vote by a three to one margin over Senator Obama. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In New York it was even greater than this: she won 87 percent of the Asian American vote. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Republic in February had a commentary titled, &quot;Asian Alienation: Why Did Asian Americans Vote So Overwhelmingly Against Barack Obama?&quot; suggesting, among other possible reasons, racist views held by Asian Americans. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, in the ethnic press, Asian Week had a commentary in January by Emil Guillermo titled, &quot;Nobama: Why Is Obama Snubbing Asian Americans?&quot; exploring the Obama campaign's interactions with the 80-20 Initiative. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be fair, part of the invisibility has to do with electoral politics. In a country of approximately 304 million, there are 15 million Asian Americans. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within this very relatively small percentage of the overall population, there is a very high percentage of foreign born and a high &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*207]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  percentage non-citizen. In addition, there are differential voter registration rates in the sub-groups, which lead to the following result: only 50 percent of Asian Americans in California are likely voters, while the number shrinks to only 43 percent at the national level. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, there is the coastal concentration of Asian Americans, which means that they live primarily in blue states. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seventy-five percent of Asian Americans live in only ten states. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given these statistics, does our vote matter? There are recent articles that suggest that it may. For example, in the swing states of Florida, Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, the Asian American population in each of those states ranges between 125,000 and 185,000. Even if one accounts for only 43 percent of the adult population voting, given that the margin of victory could be tens of votes or even a few thousand votes, the Asian American vote could make a difference in these battleground states, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> especially in presidential elections because of the way the winner in almost every state gets all of the state's electoral college votes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National polls seem to indicate that likely Asian American voters are leaning two to one in favor of Obama, but there's a huge proportion, nearly one-third, that remains undecided or uncommitted. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One can compare this with Obama's support among African Americans. A recent Gallup poll tells us that 91 percent of African Americans favor Obama, as compared to 3 percent leaning toward John McCain. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Yang, the publisher of the now-defunct A Magazine, who now writes the column &quot;Asian Pop&quot; in the San Francisco Chronicle, speculated that Barack Obama might be our first Asian American president. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If that is the case, why are we not seeing more support in Asian American communities in line with what Obama enjoys in the African American community, or even similar to that enjoyed by Bill Clinton, our so-called &quot;first black president&quot;? One must keep in mind that Yang is playing off of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*208]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a line by Toni Morrison, who commented during the Monica Lewinsky scandal that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>white skin notwithstanding, this is our first black president, blacker than any actual black person who could be elected in our children's lifetime. After all, he displays every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working class, saxophone playing, McDonald's and junk food loving boy from Arkansas. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Yang discusses Obama's childhood years in Hawaii and Indonesia and talks about his multiracial family, eventually distilling his values as traditional Asian American values. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are the values that Jeff Yang tells us Obama shares with Asian Americans: aspiration tempered with pragmatism, strenuous effort and rigorous accountability as the bedrock of success, moderation in all things, humility in times of triumph, patience in periods of tribulation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hear what Yang is saying, but I am just not feeling it. I also want to note that Toni Morrison's comments were probably not meant to designate or confer onto Bill Clinton an &quot;honorary Negro&quot; status. As Elizabeth Alexander, in a recent piece on salon.com has noted, the phrase that was elided and which would provide a context is this: &quot;The always and already guilty perp is being hunted down not by a prosecutor's obsessive application of law but by a different kind of pursuer, one who makes new laws out of the shards of those he breaks.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is the experience of victimization that is the strongest link, the strongest trope that links him to the experience of black men, and it is something that is completely forgotten in the way that phrase, that &quot;he's our first black president,&quot; has gained traction. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But think about how strongly this phrase, taken out of context, has gained traction so that even Hillary Clinton can make a joke that she is in an interracial marriage. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But back to Obama. Why does Yang's commentary not resonate with me? My friend and mentor, the late Jerome McCristal Culp, Jr., told me a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*209]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  story about his graduation from the University of Chicago, and how after the ceremony an elderly black man, who was a custodian at the university but whom Jerome did not personally know, approached him, congratulated him, and told him how proud he was of him. Jerome was struck by that moment, how a complete stranger felt a connection to him based on race that allowed him to take pride in Jerome's accomplishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider the difference between being able to take pride in the accomplishment of another and mere congratulations. To be able to take pride requires some kind of connection, and here the connection was based on shared blackness, shared racial community, where one is able to not just celebrate but to share in the success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can I take pride in the success of Barack Obama? I think it is a key question of whether or not I am going to feel the kind of solidarity that will allow me to have a kind of ownership stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is a flip side to racial pride, and it is racial shame. Racial shame is more familiar to me. For instance, I think about the tragedy that took place in Virginia Tech and I think about the Korean American, Seung-Hui Cho, who killed all of the students and then took his own life. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I was teaching a class about Asian Americans in the law when that incident took place, and after the incident, a Korean American student came to class and apologized to the entire class. Think about what that moment means - he was apologizing because he felt some kind of accountability for what this fellow Korean person did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This kind of racial shame demonstrates a kind of connection, and this makes me wonder: is there a way to think about and explore this idea of racial shame to then be able to feel more strongly this kind of pride? Can we then transcend our narrow ethnic bounds? I ask myself: why did I follow Chan Ho Park and not Hideo Nomo? Of course, Chan Ho Park is Korean, not even Korean American. That alone makes me reflect on the different ways that we might identify: the narrow, ethnic, nation of origin or imagined nation of origin, then the Korean American, and then the broader Asian American - which carries with it its own question of Asian American solidarity - and, then, maybe people of color and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can we get to a notion of racial otherness that transcends the traditional categories occupied by non-whites? Black, Indian, Asian, Latina and Latino? How do we engage in coalition building that moves beyond issue-specific organizing, that would allow for feelings of solidarity, that brings about deep identification with those who are not us so that we can, as Jerome Culp has said, participate in the struggles of those who are not ourselves? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Does the answer to this lie in the post-racial? &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*210]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama has been said to be running the first post-racial campaign, that his success somehow marks a post-racial moment or ushers in a new post-racial era. If that is so, where do Asian Americans fit within post-racial America? I find this question particularly vexing because I've spent much of my academic career talking about where Asian Americans fit within America's racial landscape, a landscape dominated by the black-white racial paradigm. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I do not feel that this work has been completed, yet here I am, now having to think about it and to retool and say, &quot;Where do we fit in the post-racial landscape?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps I am too entrenched in the &quot;racial.&quot; Is post-racial something that the younger generation just gets? Speaking of the younger generation, I was watching the second debate with my family, and during the debate my three-year-old asked, &quot;Who's winning?&quot; My brother-in-law, who was watching with us, said, &quot;The black guy.&quot; And my three-year old inquired, &quot;Which one?&quot; We had to puzzle about this. What in the world did he mean by &quot;which one&quot;? There is a white guy on stage, John McCain, and a black guy, Barack Obama. Finally, we figured it out. My son was talking about their suits. They were both wearing dark or black suits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't mean to suggest that my three-year-old is part of that younger generation that just &quot;gets&quot; this post-racial thing, because clearly that moment is a pre-racial one. It is a time of innocence. What bothers me, though, is that this time of innocence is probably not going to last very long, as he will learn too soon about the original sin that is the stain upon this nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What could &quot;post-racial&quot; mean, and how can we get to the post-racial without working through the racial? One concern I have with &quot;post-racial&quot; is that it can be too easily deployed by neo-conservatives, similar to the epistemic violence that has been and continues to be done to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s invocation of his daughters and the content of their character, which became transmogrified into a kind of colorblindness that is used to sweep clean the slate of history to usher in an era of formal equality. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's speech on race is reassuring to me. There is a lot of nuance there, but I am afraid that he will not be able to control the content of the post-racial. Once it is out there, there will be a struggle over its meaning, a confrontation over it. I worry that &quot;post-racial&quot; was designed to manage race during this election. And by &quot;manage&quot; I mean to push it below the surface: we are not really supposed to talk about it. During the rare moments when we talk about it, it usually ends up turning to the question of affirmative action and, in an even more reductionist move, the primary &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*211]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  question posed to Obama is, &quot;Do you favor or would you favor affirmative action for your daughters?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech on race, Obama talks about the legitimate anger that white people feel about race-based affirmative action, and then when he is asked that question, &quot;Would you favor affirmative action for your daughters?&quot;, the answer that he gives, and in some ways the only answer that he can give, is, &quot;No.&quot; In this answer, he seems to indicate a willingness to shift to class-based affirmative action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even this discussion of affirmative action is missing so much. I first encountered Obama in 2004 in Illinois, where he spoke at one of the many &quot;Brown at 50&quot; conferences on the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. He was probably a presidential aspirant then, but I certainly didn't know it then. It was fascinating to hear him and then to think about his words in 2004 and how he has had to march so much to the center in order to become electable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's interesting to compare his perspective now with his perspective when he was in law school. Back then, he gave a strong defense of affirmative action, saying that he undoubtedly benefited from affirmative action in his own career, although he has not provided specifics with regard to which institutions. The narrative also includes how friends recall that he did not list his race when he applied to Harvard Law School. He also says that he has no way of knowing whether race played a factor in his becoming a member of the Harvard Law Review, although he says that he would certainly not be ashamed of that fact if it were to be the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be nice if we were able to know with certainty how race has helped and hurt us. It is peculiar that we seem so unable to acknowledge the times when affirmative action has helped us. For example, I am a beneficiary of affirmative action. I know very concretely that being Asian American was something that was looked upon favorably with regard to at least two of my teaching jobs. It was very much a plus factor. But I also know, as someone who went to college in the mid-1980, that I was probably harmed by what Jerry Kang calls negative action, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> informal caps on Asian American admissions, similar to what Ivy League schools did to Jews in the early to middle parts of the 20th century. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is strange that we are so unable to talk about this, and I wonder about the space that might have been opened up if people like George W. Bush had gotten up and said, &quot;Hi, I am an affirmative action baby.&quot; Think about the effect his family legacy had on his admission to both Yale and Harvard - there is an affirmative action baby. He could be the poster child for affirmative action: &quot;Look at what affirmative action can do for you! &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*212]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You can become President of the United States.&quot; Although it's also quite possible that with the mess that he has wrought upon this country, he might actually become the poster child for the other side: &quot;Here is the problem with affirmative action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So where am I at the end of the day? When Obama announced his candidacy, I have to confess that I did not hold out much hope. I did not have &quot;the audacity.&quot; It is not that I favored any of the other candidates - I simply did not hold out much hope. I am old. I am tired. I was a freshman in college when Jesse Jackson first ran for president. At the beginning of Obama's candidacy, the best that I hoped for was that he would run strongly enough to influence the Democratic platform to ensure that black interests were not taken for granted by the Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the beginning, perhaps I was not listening closely enough, because clearly he is someone who thinks beyond and cares for more than the black community. As he said in his major speech on race, echoing the authors of the Constitution, he really is searching for a more perfect union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so we find ourselves at this juncture in history. I wish that Asian Americans were more visible during this election. Paul Ong, a professor of Urban Planning, Social Welfare and Asian American Studies at UCLA, suggested that Asian Americans are sleeping giants during this election. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That may be so, but if it is, it is time for us to wake up. It is time to wake our communities. I want us to matter, because unless we make our voices heard through our votes, then being invisible will ultimately be something that we do to ourselves. But remember, that our work doesn't end with the election. Whoever wins, we must continue to raise our voices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Postscript. January 9, 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the new year begins, we find ourselves near the beginning of a historic presidency. A black man will soon be sitting in the oval office. As powerful and inspiring as that image may be, the new year also brought us the images of a brother lying face down in an Oakland BART station, shot in the back at close range by a transit police officer even as other officers were holding the brother down. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I find myself haunted by the two images in juxtaposition: Barack Obama sitting in the oval office; and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> being held face down in Oakland. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*213]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's a new year. And it's not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new year finds millions losing their homes, with people of color being particularly hard hit by the mortgage meltdown and ensuing financial crisis. Yet a bank is soon going to put cash in my pocket to refinance my mortgage at a lower rate where I'll end up saving even more money. In the midst of this economic crisis, contradictions abound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenges are daunting. Despite what the Obama victory symbolizes, I find myself more and more believing what Derrick Bell told us years ago of the permanence of racism. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as Derrick Bell reminds us, we need not despair. We simply go on as we always have, finding meaning in the struggle, working to make a difference where we can, and not losing hope because we seem unable to secure that elusive victory of eradicating racism once and for all. We keep going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a new year.</SPAN></P>

The videotape must meet the test of relevance, which means there must be a sufficient relationship between the videotape and some issue in the particular litigation. The next hurdle is Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence; the question of whether probative value of the videotape is substantially outweighed by such * Professor of Law, Touro Law Center.

Professor Schwartz has authored leading treatises including SECTION 1983 LITIGATION: CLAIMS AND DEFENSES (4th ed. 2004-2006), SECTION 1983 LITIGATION: FEDERAL EVIDENCE (4th ed. 2007), and SECTION 1983 LITIGATION: JURY INSTRUCTIONS (1999). Professor Schwartz is also the author of a bi-monthly column for the New York Law Journal entitled &quot;Public Interest Law.&quot; This Article is based on a presentation given at the Practising Law Institute's Twenty-Fifth Annual Conference on Section 1983 Civil Rights Litigation, in New York, New York. The author expresses appreciation for the valuable assistance of Touro Law Review in the preparation of this Article. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*858]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dangers as misleading the jury, confusing the jury, wasting time, or creating unfair prejudice. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rule 403 applies to a very high percentage of evidence sought to be introduced in federal court. It should also be noted that the same relevance and 403 issues arise when videotape evidence in a state court is sought to be introduced. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proponent of a videotape must also lay a foundation, which is summed up in terms of identification and accuracy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traditionally, the proponent needs to produce a witness who can identify what the videotape depicts, and testify that the videotape is a fair and accurate depiction of what actually occurred. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This question of identification and accuracy overlaps with Rule 403 because, the more accurate the videotape, the higher its probative value is high, and the less likely the videotape would cause unfair prejudice, mislead, or confuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Videotapes, of course, have the potential to distort. There could be issues, for example, with the angle from which the videotape was taken, the lighting during the recording of the videotape, or the speed at which events are depicted. Further, the pace might be accurate, but there might be a change in conditions between the time of the event and the time the videotape was made. This is unlikely to be an issue in police misconduct cases because the videotape is typically of a particular encounter with a law enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There could also be a chain of custody issue if the videotape &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*859]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was handled by a number of individuals. Part of the foundation that has to be laid is, to the extent possible, accounting for each possession of the videotape. Ultimately, the proponent has to convince the trial judge there was not a substantial likelihood that the videotape was exchanged or altered. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there were an audio component to the videotape, the foundation must include voice identification. There must be a witness who can identify the voice of the speaker and provide the basis for such knowledge. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, an audio component could lead to the dreaded hearsay problem. All audio components to the video are out-of-court statements. If offered for the truth of what it asserts, there is a hearsay issue and the proponent would have to find a hearsay exemption or exception to get the audio component admitted. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are the evidence issues that normally arise with videotape evidence. There is case law supporting an alternative foundation that the proponent may lay. If the proponent cannot produce a witness to identify what the videotape depicts and testify to the accuracy, he may be able to lay the foundation by showing how the videotape was produced, what type of equipment was used, and who produced the videotape. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*860]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The second issue is the role of the videotape on summary judgment. In 2007, the Supreme Court decided Scott v. Harris, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involving a high-speed police pursuit of nineteen-year-old Harris. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As typically happens, the pursuit escalated. The pursuit terminated when pursuing officer Scott rammed Harris' vehicle from behind. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harris' vehicle went down an embankment, turned over, and rendered Harris a quadriplegic. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harris brought a Section 1983 excessive force claim alleging a violation of the Fourth Amendment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The officer moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, relying in part on videotapes of the chase made from two pursuing police cruisers. Nevertheless, the district court judge held there were factual questions for the jury as to whether officer's ramming of Harris' vehicle was objectively reasonable. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Scott appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This circuit has generally been unfriendly territory for those who sue law enforcement officers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three circuit judges agreed that there were factual issues the jury had to resolve in order to determine whether the officer acted in an objectively reasonable fashion. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*861]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Therefore, four lower court judges - the district judge and three circuit judges - who found that a jury should determine the objective reasonableness of the officers' use of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States Supreme Court, however, reversed, eight-to-one. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Supreme Court found that this case did not require a jury because the summary judgment record included the videotape of the police chase and there were &quot;no allegations or indications that this videotape was doctored or altered in any way, nor any contention that what it depicts differs from what actually happened.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Supreme Court posted the videotape on its web site. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was a rare move for the Supreme Court. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, it is the only time such a posting has occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion for the Court, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, &quot;What we see on the video more closely resembles a Hollywood-style car chase of the most frightening sort.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the oral argument, Justice Scalia had stated this was the most frightening police chase he had seen since the movie &quot;The French Connection.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The majority said that based upon the videotape, a reasonable jury could &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*862]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  find only that Officer Scott acted in an objectively reasonable fashion. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Stevens dissented and said he did not find the chase frightening at all. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the problem was he was older than his colleagues. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When he learned to drive, one-lane roads were common, and it was common for those driving on these one-lane roads to go over to the other side of the road. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believed his colleagues did not realize this. More fundamentally, he opined that the objective reasonableness of an officer's use of force should normally be an issue for the jury. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He accused his colleagues of usurping the function of the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, all told, five federal court jurists found that the case presented an issue for the jury, but eight Supreme Court Justices found that there was no need for a jury. My initial reaction was that the majority got it right, because the court had the videotape. Why do we need a jury? However, the more I thought about this issue, and after seeing a videotape that Jack Ryan presented at last year's Practising Law Institute Section 1983 Litigation program depicting the use of a taser, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I became more and more convinced that the Supreme Court did not get it right. Jack Ryan was good enough to provide me with a copy of the video he showed of a police officer using a taser. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have shown it to a number of individuals. Some of them you might characterize &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*863]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as farily liberal, some fairly conservative, and some in-between. The responses from these individuals have been varied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reasonable people can look at the same video and see different things. Certainly, they can characterize what they see differently. They can draw different inferences from what they see. They can reach different overall conclusions. So, I ultimately concluded that despite the existence of a videotape, the jury should normally be the finder of the facts. The benefit of the doubt should be in favor of allowing the jury to fulfill its traditional function of finder of the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lower federal courts have latched on to Scott. There are more and more rulings on summary judgment in favor of police officers based on videotape evidence. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scott makes it much more difficult for plaintiffs' lawyers to get their Section 1983 excessive force claims to the jury. That is very significant because, as plaintiffs' lawyers quickly learn, if the plaintiff can get the case to the jury there is a much greater probability of settling the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third question is the admissibility of computer-generated simulations. Assuming the computer-generated simulation is relevant to an issue being litigated, Federal Rule of Evidence 403 becomes the big issue. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is the probative value of this computer-generated &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*864]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  simulation? What is the danger for creating unfair prejudice and confusing and misleading the jury? I will use one case to illustrate the point. This case raises an issue I consider to be difficult. The case is Datskow v. Teledyne Continental Motors Aircraft Products. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not a Section 1983 case, but it illustrates the evidentiary issues. There was an airplane crash in which four people died, and the plaintiffs brought suit against the manufacturer of the engine. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plaintiffs had an expert witness, who was a mechanical engineer with a background in accident reconstruction. He testified that the engine caught fire during the flight. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The expert gave an opinion as to what caused the engine to catch fire and how the fire spread. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To illustrate his theory of this airplane fire, the plaintiffs' lawyer wanted to show a computer-generated simulation in conjunction with the expert's testimony. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plaintiffs' lawyers wanted to show this simulation superimposed with the actual audiotape recording of the communications from the pilot to the airport control tower. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The defendants were not too thrilled about this, and argued that the computer-generated simulation should be excluded under Rule 403. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The district judge ruled under Rule 403 that the computer-generated simulation was admissible, but that there was potential for its creating &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*865]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unfair prejudice and misleading the jury. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The district judge decided to take two steps in an attempt to eliminate or at least minimize these concerns. The first step, and this, I think, is not the controversial part of the opinion, was to allow the computer-generated simulation to be shown without the audio component. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The district judge thought allowing the audio radio communications might give the jury a misimpression that the simulation is the real thing, and not just a simulation created by a computer. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second step is the interesting one, namely, the district judge instructed the jury that the computer-generated simulation was not meant to be a recreation of the incident, but only a device to &quot;help the jury understand the expert's opinion.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the distinction that the district judge drew. The defendants' attorney, however, argued that it was not a meaningful distinction. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judge disagreed, finding a significant distinction between a computer generated simulation introduced with the purpose of recreating what took place, and a computer-generated simulation introduced only to illustrate an expert's opinion. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think we can agree that this is a distinction, but I wonder whether it is meaningful. Realistically, was not the plaintiffs' computer-generated simulation introduced with plaintiffs' expert testimony an attempt by plaintiffs &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*866]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to recreate the plaintiffs' version of the incident? After all, the plaintiffs' expert was attempting to sell the the jury plaintiffs' version of what occurred. Viewed in this light, the distinction drawn by the district court does not seem especially meaningful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. Analysis of Video Evidence Through Film Scholarship</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Jessica Silbey*<BR>&nbsp;<BR> I am glad we started off with Scott. While I am now a law professor, I have been thinking about law and film for a long time. My career started as a film scholar. For any of you who have thought or considered film as an art form, as well as a piece of evidence, what I talk about today might seem commonsensical. Interestingly enough, it is far from common in the courts. I am going to discuss the history of film as a background way to think more about how you might take apart or cross examine film as evidence - either as a plaintiff's attorney or a defendant's attorney - in order to show how film is never umambiguous in its meaning or import. I will do so by focusing particularly on police films (confessions, interrogations, crime stops, arrests).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We started with Scott. To my knowledge, this is the first time the Supreme Court has posted a link on its web site to a video at issue. I found this case particularly distressing because not only was summary judgment granted because of the videotape, but in discussing * Associate Professor of Law, Suffolk University Law School; Stanford University, B.A.; University of Michigan, J.D. and Ph.D. This Article is based on Cross-Examining Film, 8 U. Md. L.J. Race, Religion, Gender &amp; Class 101 (2009).  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*867]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the evidence presented on the videotape during oral argument, Justice Breyer noted, &quot;I see with my eyes that is what happened, what am I supposed to do?&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Scalia's majority opinion indicated that the standard for summary judgment when you have videotape evidence of this kind is that the facts should be considered in the light depicted by the videotape. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a best evidence problem. The questions are how persuasive and how accurate is a videotape taken from a camera mounted on a police car (or on an ATM machine, or on a tollbooth)? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Importantly, persuasion and accuracy are not necessarily linked. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What are the undisputed and disputed facts this videotape might contain?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Stevens was the lone dissenter and he recognized a nuance that his eight other colleagues did not: a film's appearance of reality is only just that - an appearance. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is merely one representation of the event. It is what we call &quot;monocular.&quot; It is not multi-ocular, which is what all of our experiences of reality are together. The videotape of the event is one singular perspective of the event. The Court in Scott v. Harris mistakenly characterized it as the best perspective that ought to be considered. Justice Stevens recognized the chase might not have been as scary as it appeared on film, and that there are other perspectives that would have borne on the issue of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*868]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  excessive force that were not captured by the videotape that should have been considered by the rest of the Court (as they were by the trial court on summary judgment). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What could the attorneys have done differently in Scott? The practical ramification is the real question here. What should the attorneys have done to deflect what Justice Scalia said, &quot;he created the scariest chase I ever saw since &quot;The French Connection?' &quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attorneys should have brought to bear the critical tools we all use when we cross-examine witnesses and when we evaluate documentary evidence. These tools can and should be utilized on film evidence. Film does not speak for itself anymore than a testifying witness does. Film is representational. It has a perspective, an angle, a point of view and a voice. Film has inherent biases: it is a restricted view. Examining those biases undercuts the persuasive force of film's dominant story. The attorneys should have cross-examined the film. In what follows, I will explain how this might occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before we go through tools and methods of cross-examining film, however, I begin with a brief background on film as an art form. Before talking about how to debunk the myth of film as wholly revealing, transparent and unambiguous, this history will introduce the problem of film as always already subjective and ambiguous. The Scott majority thought the film was unambiguous as to its meaning &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*869]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and its content. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eight justices agreed on what they thought the videotape showed as a probative matter. This evidences the myth of film as a form of communication that it is revelatory and clear. I am going to talk about this in more detail and then present a problem based on a videotape of an arrest that was used at a 2003 trial in the Western District of Texas. It was used at trial by both sides of the case to assert that their legal position - liable or not - was right. It is an interesting example of where one film takes on two diametrically opposed meanings. I will show you this film and then use it to demonstrate various techniques or theories of cross-examination to either emphasize the dominant narrative in the film or to undercut that narrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preliminarily, let's consider all the different kinds of film evidence that might be offered at trial. The most common form I call &quot;evidence verite&quot; after cinema verite, a genre of film that purports to be a representation of reality but really is self-consciously distorting it. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are many kinds of evidence verite out there. There is surveillance footage, taken with a handheld camera by the police, with a mounted camera on the cruiser dash, or automatically as in the cases of ATMs and toll booths. Evidence verite also includes after-the-fact crime footage such as filmed confessions and footage taken at the scene of the crime. After-the-fact crime scene footage is often partially narrated by a police officer or by an interrogator. Surveillance footage tends to be real time and unedited, although it is framed by a beginning and an end. Surveillance footage is the hardest to debunk &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*870]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  because it feels the most real. As we will see, however, that feeling is part of the myth of film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other kinds of common film evidence are day-in-the-life films and expert demonstrations. I call these different kinds of films &quot;staged and scripted.&quot; These films are made in expectation of a trial. They are clearly advocacy because they are taken to make a point, to assert a fact in issue. One might wonder what the difference is between a film that is allegedly demonstrative of an expert's testimony (showing the likely mobility of a limb after an injury) and a film that allegedly shows the extent of the injury (filming the victim). Because the trial is supposed to adjudicate what happened based on all the relevant, admissible evidence, and because a film of the injury (or its reenactment) is a representation of one side's argument about what happened and the injuries, film should never be taken at face value (whatever that could be said to mean). When you admit film evidence, the subjective portion of the film is easily forgotten in light of its persuasive power. With day-in-the-life films and expert demonstrations, there are out-takes or edited portions. A smart attorney will seek, through discovery requests, such outtakes or edits. Such discovery requests will seek the reasons for the exclusion of some film and the inclusion of others. Requests or examination will ask why the film started at point X and not point Y. Attorneys should inquire as to all aspects of the film process. Often times, however, these requests are never made or they are contested as work product. But if work product is the objection, this simply confirms the premise that the film has been constructed for trial - it is literally fictional (from &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*871]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Latin fingere which means &quot;to form or make&quot;) rather than real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of these varied forms of film, it is also important to think about how we are all filmmakers. We have camera phones. We rely on MRI's, FMRI's, CAT scans, PET scans, and other variants of moving image technology. The breadth of what constitutes filmic evidence is growing. With cameras on laptops and phones, the growth of filmic evidence is exponential; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> therefore, we must concentrate our critical capacities on this growing kind of evidence to better understand its influence and its drawbacks. We must not allow it to dominate all the other evidence at trial, especially as it is not necessarily any more trustworthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you look at the case law and all the cases that are considering filmic evidence - the admissibility of filmic evidence or the prejudice of filmic evidence - the cases tend to admit it despite a Rule 403 objection. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sometimes there are jury instructions, sometimes not. It is up to the attorneys in the case to recharacterize the film's significance and meaning as disputed. We can draw on popular culture in doing so. We watch film all the time. When we go to the movies we do not necessarily believe Michael Moore's version of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*872]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the truth as sacrosanct. We can easily motivate our critical capacities when it comes to Hollywood versions or independent documentaries. Why are we not critical of filmic evidence? We all have the capacity to be film critics. And yet for some reason when judges and attorneys face a piece of police footage, that critical capacity dissipates. Film evidence should not be left undisputed. By drawing on our critical capacities, we can tell alternative stories embedded in the film or that the film has omitted. Doing so goes a long way to deflating the power of film's illusion of reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Film's playful illusion of reality began at its birth in 1895. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the story of the first film shown to a movie audience, in the Grand Cafe in Paris, demonstrating how film created in viewers a sense of reality, what we call the &quot;myth of total cinema.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Viewers were made to feel like witnesses, seeing with their eyes whatever was on screen. The story of the first film is of a movie called &quot;The Arrival of a Train at a Station.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is an actualite film, which is essentially a short documentary film. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n61</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The film was of a train arriving into a station, the train getting bigger and bigger on the screen as it got closer and closer to the station. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the train grew larger on screen, the audience of this film jumped up and ran out of the theatre. They were afraid the train was going to run them down. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*873]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With this experience of the train coming at them, the feeling of the film as real and revelatory and unambiguous was born. These are the feelings we enjoy when watching film. And this is why it is incredibly difficult to undermine film as a piece of evidence. With the changing film technologies to better capture film's illusion of reality, film became even more powerful as entertainment and rhetoric. One of the first narrative films, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; in 1903 by Edwin Porter, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was dubbed one of the first pseudo-documentaries. Its purported subject was &quot;how to rob a train.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With this film came the fears and hopes that have not abated today: that film is an incredibly effective teaching tool. This is the beginning of film's corrupting power. It appears to tell us how life really is, what we should be doing. It tells us about the truth of life. Capitalizing on this incredibly persuasive and pleasurable power, many pseudo-documentaries would follow. I am thinking here of the by-now famously staged documentary &quot;Nanook of the North,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also of Dziga Vertov's newsreel montages describing the Bolshevik Revolution with news clips that piece together a story under the guise of a documentary. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leni Reifenstahl's &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is another &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*874]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  example, glorifying the Nazi regime. Recently, we see examples with Michael Moore's films. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moore's are clearly advocacy-based documentaries. My point is not that there is something real or not real about documentaries. The point is that all film is a form of rhetoric. This was plain from the very beginning. And today, that seems quite obvious. All film, fictional or not, is a representation and by its nature it is partial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edwin Porter's &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; also contributed to the development of film form through its editing structure. Porter's &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; taught us that film can create a specific meaning by juxtaposing different shots that would otherwise be discontinuous. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Soviet filmmaker Kuleshov proved this principle by stringing together otherwise unrelated images to show how the same image, when framed differently, can take on entirely new meaning. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He conducted a series of experiments with images of a bowl of soup next to a head shot of man, a picture of a corpse next to the same image of a man, and a picture of a woman reclining next to the same man. When the audience is shown these images, the man looks hungry next to the bowl of soup, mournful next to the corpse, and desirous next to the woman. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is the same image each time, but it has a different meaning depending on what precedes it. Here, the audience brings meaning to the film. It is not the film that inherently &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*875]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has meaning. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part of cross-examining film requires that you ask questions about its framing: would these images mean something else if started at a different place? If it was preceded by some other image? In film theory, we call this montage. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The point is simply that the same shot means different things depending on its relationship to the images that it precedes and follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other than montage, there is also camera angle: wide angle, depth of field, long shots, and pan shots. D.W. Griffith was the originator of this kind of film grammar. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Close-ups create feelings of intimacy. Many after-the-crime scene footage have close-ups - long pans with a static close-up on a corpse or on a bloody stain. This creates narrative emphasis; it makes the audience feel differently about that bloody stain or that corpse, even though the fact of the stain or corpse has not changed at all. In one case I studied, the static shot on a corpse was fourteen minutes long in a film that was only twenty-five minutes. The film in no way distorts the facts of the case, it nonetheless expresses an emphatic and overwhelming subjective point of view through its use of angle and framing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A film's point of view is yet another feature of its rhetorical form (in addition to the shape of the frame, the angle of the frame, and the editing). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Point of view is the way in which the film develops a narrative voice. The first person narrative film developed very &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*876]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  early in film's history. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first person narrative form helps perpetuate a feeling of singularity and wholeness in the story. The cohering effect of this narrative voice, however, was immediately problematized from the earliest of films. For example, in &quot;The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari,&quot; the audience hears a long drawn out story about the life of the main character. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the end of the film, the audience learns the narrator, whom we have come to trust as the voice in our own head, speaks from inside an insane asylum. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Learning this taints the perspective, the story and its truth value. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We do not trust the narrator, and, because he has been the eyes through which we see and experience the story, we don't trust ourselves. This is a credibility problem. Narrative point of view in film has everything to do with the credibility of the narrator. No film is omniscient. Every film has a point of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not twenty years after the birth of film, the development of the first person narrative was already problematizing this idea of film's mistaken omniscience. Instead of seeing with their own eyes, viewing audiences very early in film culture were being trained to ask &quot;with whose eyes am I actually seeing?&quot; This is precisely the question you want to be asking yourself when dealing with film evidence. It is unavoidable that films have a point of view. There is always going to be a filmmaker and a camera whose perspective is being captured. This may feel troubling if we are dealing with documentary &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*877]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  films or evidence verite, but it is unavoidable. It is, indeed, the nature of all adjudicative disputes: settling differences between different versions of the same event. Film versions are but one of many. They should not dominate the search for truth at law. They should not be the only perspective we rely on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The critique of film's illusion of reality and of its completeness is all but lost if you look at the court cases that deal with filmic evidence. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite our surveillance society, where film records life twenty-four hours a day seven days a week, film is not a mechanism for witnessing. Its capacity to wholly and truthfully reveal the world is a myth that is based in the early days of film. Film reveals one perspective of the world. Without bringing our critical capacities to its form, its dominant images may exercise undue control over our judgment. So our goal, then, is to transform the viewing experience from seeing with our own eyes - this illusion of bearing witness to the car chase for example - to &quot;the more you watch, the less sure you are of what you are seeing.&quot; Our goal is also to recognize the competing stories that animate the film's images. This transformation from &quot;seeing with our own eyes&quot; to &quot;the more you watch the less sure you are of what you see&quot; will go a long way to debunking the mistaken assumptions about film that animate so many of these court cases. This transformation would put pressure on the myths that film is transparent, that it is morally objective, and that it exposes the truth of the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am now going to discuss a short film clip at the center of the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*878]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court case Patric v. Visi. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jason Patric, the Hollywood film actor, was celebrating the wrap of a film in Austin, Texas. After he emerged from a bar with a bunch of friends, he was arrested for being drunk and disorderly, and then for resisting arrest. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both charges were dropped, but he alleges that during the arrest the police used excessive force. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So he filed a civil rights claim against the City of Austin and its police department. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A camera, positioned on the dashboard of the police car nearby and running serendipitously, captured much of the altercation and the arrest. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both sides used the film to help prove their case. Patric used it to show that he was unlawfully arrested and abused, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the City of Austin used it to show that the police followed the proper protocol when arresting Patric. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am going to show you the film now and in so doing try to narrate it bit. The film is of very poor visual quality. This is typical of a lot of police films. The angles tend to be awkward because most police films are taken from stationary cameras and are of events in motion. The pictoral quality is often very poor because many arrests occur at night in the dark without proper film lighting. But this is the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*879]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  kind of evidence lawyers will have to deal with. These films are not made under ideal conditions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is the group coming down the street. That is Patric in the white shirt. Now you are going to see someone try to hail a cab and the police are going to tell him to get back on the curb. There is Patric going out to meet the man hailing the cab. Here comes the police officer. Whether Patric gets up on the curb is a subject of dispute, as the curb is not visible behind the crowd. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is Patric trying to walk away from the police. It is very hard to see as the crowd and the car block our view, but both sides make a big issue of that small arm movement and his avoidance of the police. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And there is where he falls to the ground under the police's force. After this, he is being walked back to the police cruiser and you hear his friend pleading for Patric's release and apologizing for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what would you do if you were faced with this film? This is a difficult film; it is shot from the worst possible angle. It is hard to see anything of relevance. But both sides, if you can imagine, used it to prove their case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So these are the issues. Did Patric disobey the officer when the officer told him to get on the curb? Did the officer actually say, &quot;you are under arrest?&quot; And when Patric walked away from the officer was he resisting arrest sufficient to justify the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*880]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  police's use of force to arrest him? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How would you use this film if you were going to prove that the police did not have probable cause to arrest Patric for public intoxication, and that the police officer's actions are the cause in fact of Patric's injury?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, as a lawyer with filmic evidence, you have to decide whether to use it in the first instance. It is a hard decision, but a very important one. As claims against police departments go, Patric had a pretty good claim without the film. The sole witness against him was a police officer whose credibility would be tested for lying to a superior officer in the past. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Patric had a lot of witnesses on his behalf to say he followed the police's orders and that he was neither drunk nor belligerent. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case seemed to rise and fall on whether the police officer actually said, &quot;you are under arrest,&quot; but the film is silent on that point so why bother bringing it in? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, I think Patric's sole problem as a witness was his ego. If you read through the transcript of the case, he is fairly arrogant on the stand. The film does not help him temper this affect. The film shows his shirt untucked and his cuffs undone. In some ways, this is the problem with a film that is too complete. It may do some good for Patric. It tends to lend some credibility to his case, but also contains images that are unhelpful if not outright prejudicial. If I were Patric's lawyer, I would not have used the film at all. This goes against instinct, I realize; we want to use the film because it is so enticing &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*881]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and it is so captivating. And yet it is precisely that kind of power that might be used against you when mobilized by someone with skill. And that is what happened in this case. Patric's lawyer fell into this trap and used the film on direct as an aid to Patric's testimony. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doing that leads to problems. The lawyer was forced to ask clarifying questions of Patric: &quot;is this where you stepped up on the curb,&quot; &quot;is this where the officer threw you down?&quot; Because the film is not clear on these points, the direct examination of Patric on these crucial issues lacks persuasion. Here, the use of film weakens otherwise good testimonial evidence. For this reason, it is not always a good idea to admit it when you have other valuable, reliable evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you decide to use the film, however, or you are faced with your opponent's use of the film, what do you do? The first thing you do is consider the film frame. Where did it begin, where did it end, and what are its spatial attributes? The film tells us nothing here about whether Patric smelled of alcohol. It does not capture that kind of real evidence, which may be probative evidence. The film's point of view is not optimal. Because of its position, relevant portions of the altercation crucial to determinations of the issues in the case are outside of the film frame. Similarly, the film can tell us nothing about how many beers Patric had, or exactly what he looked like when he left the bar. We can only imagine these things based on watching the film or discover them in other ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming up with relevant facts that are not in the film is likely &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*882]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to change how we would tell the story on our client's behalf. Articluating these details that are not in the film, but that change the assessment of liability would go a long way towards undermining the dominance of the film as evidence. Challenge yourself to come up with these extra-filmic facts that might be present in the case. Would your assessment of Patric's behavior change if you knew that he only had one beer at the bar? Would your assessment of the arrest as seen on the film change if you knew the curb, blocked from our view, was broken or slippery? These are the kind of questions that help change what we think we see on the film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Focus on the aspects of the film that are unclear. There are two ways the film can be unclear. It can be unclear in focus or sound - blurry images or inaudible sound - or it can be unclear in terms of narrative ambiguity. As to the first, we do not see him hit the sidewalk because the curb is out of sight. We do not know whether his fall was accidental or intentional because the crowd is blocking our view of the police officers. We do not hear the police officer say &quot;you are under arrest&quot; because the sound quality is poor. All of this is very much what the case is about. And yet the film is unclear on these crucial points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to narrative ambiguity, we do see Patric take a few steps away from the officers. It is undisputed that Patric did this. It is the significance of Patric walking away that is disputed. Here, there is a fact of film that is undisputed - Patric walking away from the police. But that fact has competing roles in two different stories, the defense story and the plaintiff story. Patric's story was that he &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*883]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was resisting the police as an impulse, a human response to force and power. &quot;The police were targeting me,&quot; he said. &quot;I was the Alpha dog in the pack and they were going to show how they were in control so they threw me down. I was simply resisting this brute force.&quot; The police told a different story. They said they heard Patric say, &quot;fucking pigs, fucking Nazis&quot; as he moved from the crosswalk toward the curb. We do not hear this on film of course, but the police said Patric's aggressive language led them to believe he was out of control. When he moved away, they perceived it as an affirmative push, at which time they had to get control of the situation. They grabbed him and took him down to handcuff him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two stories evidence the narrative ambiguity of the film. The existence of two plausible readings of the film - the Alpha dog story and the police-taking-control-of-the-crowd story - remain unconfirmed by the film's images. Pieces of the film can be strung together to tell either of these stories fairly convincingly. It is not the film's content that convinces the jury, it's the lawyer's storytelling (e.g., advocacy) about the film that persuades us. Film does not have inherent meaning. Its audience (lawyers and fact finders) provide for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This film is a particularly good example of filmic ambiguity. But most films can be treated this way: a film of a confession, a film of an ATM robbery, a film of a crime scene. When confronted with filmic evidence, there are some basic questions that you want to ask. Do you use film at all? Are there prejudicial statements in this film that would be lethal if used by the other side? Editing the film raises &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*884]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  questions of lack of completeness and doctoring; failing to edit the film leads to all sorts of problems of prejudice and hearsay. Sometimes omitting the film all together is the best option. Is there other evidence that is just as good or better so that you do not have to worry about prejudicial aspects of the film? What is not in the film that might be relevant that would help you tell a different story than the one the film appears to be telling? Challenge yourself to come up with those facts and renarrate the film's images incorporating them. What is unclear in the film? Is it out of focus or is it narratively ambiguous? Push on those points of ambiguity to undermine the film's dispositive force as evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of these tools focus on the problem of storytelling and the inevitability of competing narratives that might structure one set of facts. Successfully asking these questions of film can be a powerful tool, especially in light of film's dominance as a storytelling medium in our society. The value of filmic narrative is not only its ability to cohere a story for the purpose of persuasion and judgment, but, in the hands of a skilled attorney, the value of filmic evidence is its capacity to tell multiple and sometimes conflicting stories. There is always more than one story to be told. That is why we have trials. Finding the alternative stories that a film tells or could have told will go a long way to demystifying the overwhelming effect of filmic evidence and to furthering the law's promises of due process and of justice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. Evaluation of Videotapes of Police Encounters With Citizens From the Legal and Law Enforcement Perspectives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Jack Ryan*<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Twenty years of experience in law enforcement had a major impact on my psyche. When I saw the picture of the guy with the soup and then the guy with the corpse and the woman, I was certain he had poisoned them with the soup and he had murdered him to get the woman. I want to talk a little bit about what we look at. I do an awful lot of work as an expert witness and a lot of training of police officers around the country. I perform many case evaluations, including work for the insurance pools that work with police agencies and insure police agencies. I get to look at and evaluate a wide variety of video and audiotape evidence. The following are some of the things you should think about, especially if you are on the defense side. If you are on the defense side, you ought to know what exists. If you are on the plaintiff's side, you ought to be looking for evidence that may be available to help prove your case. For example, we are all familiar with the mobile video recorders in police cars. They have gotten a lot better. I am going to show you some video from some old video recorders - not so great. Then I will show you some newer recordings, which are so much better.  * Co-Director of the Legal and Liability Risk Management Institute. Mr. Ryan is a graduate of Suffolk University Law School and a member of the Rhode Island and Federal Bars. Mr. Ryan retired in 2002 as Captain of the Providence Police Department after serving there for twenty years. He currently lectures on police misconduct and liability issues for law enforcement in various forums across the country and is the author of numerous police field guides, including Case Law for Critical Tasks in Law Enforcement, A Legal Guide for Officers and Supervisors, which is updated annually at the end of each Supreme Court Term. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*886]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Recently I visited Gainesville, Georgia, where the police department purchased cameras attached to microphones, which go on the epaulet of the officer's shoulders. They are pretty neat because they do not have the fixed perspective of the police car cameras that Professor Silbey talked about. Obviously, those cameras cause problems because they remain stationary and are unable to capture all of the events occurring at the scene. However, the cameras purchased by the Gainesville police actually travel with the officer and capture, at a minimum, everything in front of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, an amazing trend has started to take place. In a lot of cases, I receive video from third party sources such as businesses. For example, I had an excessive force case recently where an officer made an arrest outside of a convenience store. Interestingly, I also had video from a Wal-Mart across the street, and I also had video from the gas station that adjoined the parking lot. There were many different perspectives to look at on that video. Increasingly, the cases I work on have footage posted on YouTube. I have had numerous attorneys call me on different cases and ask me if I would get involved in a case. The attorneys tell me to visit YouTube and plug in &quot;taser&quot; and &quot;this town.&quot; The footage is available because there are people in the crowd videotaping with their cell phones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a couple of other things I think you ought to be aware exists. There is an awful lot of audio recording that officers do as well. There are many police departments around the country that issue belt tapes. I know our focus here is on video, but some of this is very helpful in a case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*887]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The other thing is video from stations, jails, and interrogation rooms. I have a case now where an officer got into an altercation at a station and ended up in a deadly force situation in the police station. The entire incident is captured on video because it was in the holding cell area. This is just another example of how we see a lot of video out there that we can get our hands on to evaluate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also two things in almost every case you should never miss. One is the 911 call, unless the officer self-initiated the contact. The 911 call will tell you a lot of things. For example, you can hear things in people's voices. I was recently involved in a shooting case involving the Las Vegas metro. The officer approached a door and a man had actually come out of the door after the officers knocked with a gun. One of the arguments in the case was that the SWAT team should have been called. The subject was barricaded and the police knew the guy had a gun. I wanted to listen to the 911 tape, and I also wanted to listen to the radio traffic between the officers. Not many people have ever listened to a police radio, but it is absolutely amazing to me when you hear an officer say he guesses this guy was upset with the solicitor that was going door-to-door knocking. He apparently came out with a gun. I will make contact with him and see what is going on. That is one scenario. The other scenario is hearing a scream. When you hear that, they should have called the SWAT team. There is this distinction that we see. This is a very valuable lesson when looking at these cases. Do not just look at video. Listen to the audio that is available. Many times you know that a mobile video recorder is running in the police car &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*888]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the officer totally forgets it is running. The officer is out of the car dealing with some contact on the side of the road and the video recorder is running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recently had an excessive force case in Michigan. A man, who was a completely unrelated witness to the excessive force, came over to an officer and said, &quot;Hey, look, I saw what happened. That was awful. The guy that got arrested, he didn't do anything. Why did that cop toss him on his face after he handcuffed him?&quot; That was unbelievable. None of that was in the police report. In fact, the officer said something like, &quot;Hey pal, I wasn't here. I didn't see what happened. See you later.&quot; No name on the police report, none of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I looked at another case on the defense side. Officers had gone to a house of a suicidal young man. There was a situation where he was down in a kind of basement, family room. Some officers had him semi-blocked in. Everybody was out of the house. He had a knife so the officers were coming up with a plan. One officer said if he tried to come up the stairs take this rake. Take the rake? Yes, take the rake. If he tried to come up the stairs, push him back downstairs with the rake. &quot;Wait, wait, wait,&quot; he said, &quot;What if he grabs the rake?&quot; Meanwhile, this was all captured on the audio recorder that was running. The other cop said. &quot;Well, let it go. Didn't you ever play tug of war when you were a kid? He'll go flying down the stairs and that will be the end of that.&quot; At one point one of the officers said, &quot;Listen, I don't fight knives with rakes. I don't fight knives with pepper spray. If he comes up those stairs I'm going to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*889]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  kill him.&quot; Guess what happens. He comes up the stairs and the officer fires about ten times. The kid was coming at the officer with a knife, so it is a difficult case. Defendable? Maybe. The kid was coming at him with a knife. The bottom line is do you think that case ever went to trial? That case never went to trial, it was settled because of the audio. You have to be aware of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recently had a defense case where a man alleged he was beaten badly when the officers arrested him. However, it was clear from the audio that there was nothing going on. It was a very congenial atmosphere. He actually fired a shotgun at the officers. The judge allowed the tape to be played and the jury came back in forty minutes in that case. Remember that mobile video recording is from a fixed position. In order to demonstrate this, it is useful to evaluate the same incident from different perspectives. Let us look at this one first. At the end of this pursuit the suspect is right in front of the car. You see a scene that leads you to believe that an execution took place. From a different car at the scene, we obtain a much different perspective. From the second recording, we see the man turn. Fixed perspective, two different perspectives. You have to be aware this may exist. In the second video it looked like he was pointing something back at the officers, and two guys shooting him in the back. It turned out to be a cell phone in that case, but you could not tell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We watch a lot of use of force video, and in doing so we are looking for a lot of different things, such as for the officer's conduct and the use of force continuum. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In evaluating these videos, we look &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*890]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for some sort of a threat. Maybe there is a lack of threat. Maybe there are a lot of officers there. If you have video and you are on the defense side, whether you like this or not, police use of force is ugly. Jurors tend to get their impression of use of force from where? TV, and on TV five cops do not generally jump on top of the guy. In real life five cops jump on top of the guy. There are no fair fights in real life. We want to be able to look at this and determine whether there was a real threat. Was there a lack of threat? How many people were present? Were there weapons? Was the person a threat to the public? Those are the kinds of things we are going to look for in a video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us evaluate another video. Here, the officer has already had contact with a suspect. The officer wants to arrest him for public intoxication. He tells him to turn around and put his hands on his back, and knees him because the guy grabs hold of him. Now he tries pepper spraying him. When different experts evaluated this, there was an agreement on both sides that the officer had done some things right and some things improperly. What you do not see, and what you cannot see, is that the officer struck the guy about twelve times with his baton. They were light strikes, and the officer was actually striking him with what they call a continuation strike that he learned in the police academy. The chief of police saw this video and fired him immediately. He was criminally charged in this particular case, but in the subsequent civil case, the judge held that the officer had qualified immunity based on the video. I guess the judge relied on &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*891]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his interpretation of the video more than the video itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An additional consideration is whether to enhance a video. In fact, Professor Silbey made a comment that was kind of interesting. She said to tie down the testimony. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sometimes we see where the testimony gets tied down in a different way. In this particular video from within the last year, the officer was actually criminally charged with assault on the suspect. Probably the biggest turning point in the whole case was the testimony of the suspect. He was a witness in the officer's criminal trial and was adamant that he never, ever tried to kick the officer. He never did anything to the officer because the officer's story is that the suspect kicked him as he was trying to close the car door. I will tell you when you watch the full speed video you cannot see it. In this case the attorneys slowed the video down and walked through it frame by frame and then you see a little bit of a different story. There are two or three versions, but you can actually see his foot come out and kick the officer. Again, the video was specifically used for purposes of undermining his testimony that there was in fact no kick given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One other thing to consider when you are handling these cases is what is the policy of the agency. How many have asked for video and all of a sudden you are told it was not working, which may be as helpful to plaintiffs as when they have video or they are told that the tape has already been re-used. So you want to get your hands on a policy. Most agencies now have a policy. The problem with most agency policies is they ought to be looking at videotape or digital images &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*892]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on a regular basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was in Corpus Christi, Texas recently and I spoke to 515 police officers. I asked when they looked at videotapes. They stated that they look at videotape after something happens. Sometimes these police agencies do not know if a camera is not working because nobody ever looks at it and realizes it is broken. Sometimes it is a case where the officers know what happened but it never comes to the supervisory level. I have a case in Connecticut where the officer describes how the car hit him, ran him over, and how he shot into the car. The fact of the matter is that there is video from another police car that shows he was nowhere near the car when he was shooting it, and that the car never hit him. However he did not know the tape existed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We want to be aware that there is a tape out there. The other thing is, if they tell you there is no tape, and again whichever side you are on, you better make sure tapes do not exist before and after the event. That will be a red flag for you if just the important one is missing. The other thing I always say is, &quot;is there a repair order for the missing tape?&quot; I will get a case and they will tell me they do not have the tape because the camera was not working. Does the camera work today? Oh, yes, it works today. When did you get it fixed? I will tell you one thing about government; we cannot buy pencils without putting through an invoice of some sort. There should be some paperwork on getting something like a camera fixed. Again, is there a supervisor review mechanism? If you look at the New Jersey State Police Department of Justice consent decree, one of the things &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*893]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that was required by the New Jersey State Police was that supervisors had to look at a certain number of tapes per month. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Think about this for a second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like I said, I do a lot of training. I recommend this to agencies all over the country. If you call Bank of America this afternoon, before you speak to a person, you are going to get something that says this call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance purposes. Customer Service call centers actually do that. They have a checklist. Did the person say, &quot;Good morning, this is Bank of America?&quot; Did they get three forms of identification before they gave Jack any information about his accounts to make sure it actually is Jack? They have a checklist. I ask departments all over the country why we do not do that? Why do we not do quality control on our people to make sure they are doing it right? I tell them there are lots of things you can pick up on by doing a checklist of important questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know an agency that started doing the supervisory review mechanism. They found that one of their officers was only stopping young, pretty, blond women. That was it. The chief said that apparently the officer thinks PC, probable cause, does not stand for probable cause. It stands for pretty cute. So again, the supervisory mechanism might pick some of this stuff up. By the way, if a supervisor is reviewing them, it is going to be harder for you to prove deliberate indifference if you are on the plaintiff's side. But if nobody is reviewing them, might that cut towards deliberate indifference in &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*894]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  supervisory practices? Again, we have that possibility as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IV. Computer-generated Simulations and Illustrations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Gail Donoghue*<BR>&nbsp;<BR> I am going to talk about reconstructions in police shooting cases. There is a great temptation to think about reconstructions in shooting cases because they are quite intense and emotional and generally involve high stakes. The applicable standard, as you all know, is: Was the shooting reasonable? The reasonableness turns on all the facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the shooting. Defense lawyers generally understand that it is very important to communicate the intensity of the situation to the jury, but they do not always know how to go about doing that. I think that a lot of times they repeat those famous words about split second decisions and second-guessing in the cold light of the courtroom. I do not know whether this persuades anybody or if it has an impact on the jury. It is important to convince the jury there is something more than rhetoric or closing arguments. I think that what you need to do is to be able to focus on facts that are supportable and can be corroborated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some of the videos shown, it seems that while the video may be ambiguous, there were certain facts those videos corroborated.  * Gail Donoghue is former Special Counsel to the Corporation Counsel, New York City Law Department. Prior to this position, she was the First Chief of the Special Federal Litigation Division. She joined the Law Department in 1987 after working as a litigation associate at Warshaw, Burstein, Cohen, Schlesinger &amp; Kuh and teaching at Pace Law School for two years. She has been a faculty member of the PLI Conference on Section 1983 Litigation and the Georgetown Conference on Civil Rights. Donoghue is a cum laude graduate of Pace University and holds an L.L.M. in taxation from New York University School of Law. Donoghue is a native New Yorker who currently lives in Manhattan.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*895]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An average juror is going to look at that as a human being, trusting her own senses of what she is seeing. While interpretations can differ, people were in certain frames. They were there and those facts are irrefutable. When you are making up the video or attempting to come up with an exhibit, it is different than when you are using video that is actually being taken at the scene. So as your mind drifts off to how you are going to convince the jury about the intensity of the decision that the officers face, it is easy to start to think about video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to illustrate what is possible, a demonstration video was made by a group that concentrates in this area. Watching the video is exciting and gives the viewer a lot of ideas about what is possible. It is important to pay attention to the faces that relate to an arrest and to a shooting. Then ask yourself if those visual images were at least engaging and interesting, and if they got you focused in some way. The video makes one realize that there are tremendous possibilities for demonstrating cases to a jury in using these techniques. In my career, I certainly went down that road a number of times and what I want to do today is share with you some of the things that I think are good to consider before you take on that kind of a project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, to recreate or not to recreate? The first thing to consider is that working on these demonstrations will take up a tremendous amount of attorney time. It might be tempting for a lawyer to just give the project to the experts and let them handle it because after all, they are the experts. But it is not as simple as that because you have &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*896]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to collect the evidence for them. Attorneys have to spend a lot of time talking with experts about the case, their theory of the case, what it is they want the reconstruction or animation to show, and how they can possibly accomplish that purpose. If the attorneys do not spend this time, then they are very likely to get unpredictable results. In fact, even when they do spend the time, it is possible that they will not like what the expert has formulated. This happened in the cases in which we attempted to do reconstructions. We spent a lot of time with the experts, but we did not like the reconstructions because they either minimized some of the most important circumstances in our case, or were not able to encompass them in the final product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second consideration is the physical characteristics that existed at the time of the incident. They may be such that an animation is bound to produce a bad result. Consideration must be given to the situation as it existed in physical terms, to see if it is possible to be able to recreate it in a way that will be persuasive and convincing. Attorney time becomes an issue because reconstruction has to be based on evidence, testimony, photographs, and measurement, not only for admissibility purposes, but also for persuasiveness purposes. If your expert cannot refer to facts and evidence in the case where a jury is likely to think it is believable, then he may not be able to persuade the jury that what he created does in fact represent reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The expert also has to use recognized techniques. In the case of most animations, a reconstruction's software must be recognized and the expert has to be able to testify about these facts. The lawyer must be able to direct that testimony. The lawyer must learn about &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*897]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the software from the experts, including its operation and whether it is accepted and recognized in the field, and what possible pitfalls there might be on cross-examination. This is a considerable project that requires significant time to develop and which may require additional reading. Sometimes experts are not particularly good at explaining these processes and another expert may need to be consulted who is better at explaining software and hardware, and how animation is really created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third thing the lawyer must do is examine the credentials of the expert to include a search with today's databases. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If there is something out there about a person who has some sort of public life, it is likely to be discoverable and findable on some database. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We had this happen in one of our cases. We hired an expert who seemed to have reliable credentials. We looked at those credentials on paper but we did not do a Google search until late in the day. Unfortunately, we discovered some very serious legal issues that were collateral for sure, but would nevertheless provide some fodder for cross-examination. This type of credential search has to be done before the decision is made to take the project on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With limited time, it is best to try to do a limited demonstration &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*898]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  so that it can be done well and thoughtfully, and so that it can be secured against cross-examination. Even with ample time, the expert should be consulted about how the incident will be reconstructed. For example, very often lighting conditions are crucial in a shooting situation when visibility may be obscured. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If there is darkness, then the question becomes how do you convey the feeling of darkness while at the same time having sufficient light in the demonstration for the audience to see and perceive the events as they are unfolding? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is a difficult thing to do. Conditions such as darkness are best left to jurors' imaginations rather than to try to include them in a recreation because some aspect of the reconstruction is going to fall apart. Either the darkness will not be there or the jury will not be able to perceive the events if the darkness is simulated with the accuracy occurring at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer may have very difficult issues that present themselves because of lighting conditions, which are a crucial part of the circumstances that affected the police officer's judgment. Therefore, I would be very wary about trying to reconstruct those. As everyone has discussed today, people can perceive the demonstration or the video differently. What one might think of as dark, others may not think of as dark. When the word &quot;dark&quot; is used, and a jury knows the time of day, their imagination and their life experience will fill in the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*899]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  meaning of darkness. I think that is lost if it is illustrated it in a concrete way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lapsed time is another circumstance that is very crucial in most shooting cases. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Things happen quickly, as you saw in some of the videos today. We had a case that we took to trial where the shooting occurred within six seconds of the police arriving at the scene. We went through the preparation stage of this case, including listening to the 911 communications before we clocked it. When we clocked it, it seemed to us that it was devastating to the plaintiff's case because of the existing elements of urgency and surprise. Rapidly evolving circumstances were very vividly portrayed by the lapsed time on police communication tapes. If we had made a video that went on for six seconds, it might have seemed like a lot longer than six seconds. Where you have that urgency, it might be better to not reconstruct it into a video because the video can be stopped. Once a video is admitted into evidence, there is no reason why a plaintiff cannot stop it or freeze-frame it, and it can wind up looking like an hour. Therefore, this is another consideration that I would think about before jumping on this bandwagon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confusion at the scene is another circumstance. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reason I would be reluctant to demonstrate a scene where there was confusion &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*900]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is that it can cut both ways. Yes, it could support that the circumstances were rapidly changing and evolving, but it may also suggest police officer incompetence or police officer ineptness. Thus, I would be reluctant to demonstrate that to the jury if it existed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We heard statements that use of force by police is not pretty - this is very true. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, I was standing on a subway station with my spouse one night and the police took somebody down on the other side of the platform. My husband, who has lived with a defense attorney on police cases for a long time, said, &quot;Oh my God, did you see that? That was horrible. Why did they do that?&quot; I explained to him that because the suspect was running away from them, how else were the police supposed to get this person contained? There is the possibility that this person was armed. I asked him &quot;Do you know if this person was armed?&quot; He said, &quot;No, I don't know.&quot; Maybe the cops knew. Maybe they didn't. What about that? Of course once I walked him through it he understood. But if I demonstrate that on a video, it may not look so good and may do more harm than good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also conflicts in testimony. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because human beings will react to situations in different ways, I always tell attorneys not to hide from it, not to be ashamed of it, not to cringe, not to think they had a terrible case because people had different perceptions. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*901]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, what does that do to the creation of an incident on film? Which versions of the events should be used in the reconstruction? I may be harming the case and the officer's credibility if I have to then explain to a jury in closing that some things were left out because we thought one officer's version was more correct than another officer's version. That is another situation where I would be disinclined to produce a reconstruction video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Distance is another factor. I think we would all agree distance is not accurately portrayed on film. Anybody who takes pictures knows that the lens on the camera can compress distance or extend distance. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you think distance is crucial and you cannot get an accurate portrayal of that distance, you may be undercutting the circumstances that justify the defense or prosecution of your case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Words spoken and volume are also very, very crucial factors. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If an independent evidentiary basis for words spoken is necessary, it may not be possible to get them into evidence because it may be that they are bolstering words and it will not be admitted over a hearsay objection. The absence of the words and the absence of the sound may have a very negative impact on the portrayal of the events. I think it may be better in that instance to use live testimony, which describes the events and includes or interjects what was being said as the events were unfolding. Most of the problems we encountered during the two reconstructions had an impact on our dissatisfaction &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*902]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the final result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another dilemma faced in reconstructing scenes is creating physical characteristics. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How do you decide how the characters or the figures, for lack of a better word, in the video are going to appear? A person's face or image has a tremendous impact on the way other people respond emotionally to that person. It can become a precarious situation because it can be dehumanizing to have no faces appear on the figures. I call them figures because that is what they look like - this is not a hockey video game. This is a reconstruction of a very serious matter. Do you want to dehumanize a situation like that? If facial features are used, you run the risk of tremendous objections because the facial features may not be becoming or they may be perfectly fine facial features but misleading in terms of youth or general overall appearance. There may be very significant objections to using visual facial images that do not exactly correspond to the live persons, especially if this is being offered as a reconstruction of the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of these potential dilemmas must be thought about when creating a reconstruction of the event. In my mind, all of these weigh against undertaking reconstructions. But that is not to say that I do not think the computer techniques that you saw in the video are not tremendous aids to presenting a case. They work very well when you have a more limited purpose and they support that limited purpose. I am going to give you some examples of what I mean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*903]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many years ago, we made a video in a shooting case where the police officer pursued somebody who had stolen a car. The technology was not very good. The police officers struggled with a young man for his gun in a stairwell. The young man was younger and fit. We all know many police officers are not fit. The officer shot him intentionally because he believed his life was in danger. We had crime scene photos that showed the area where it occurred, including the bloodstains on the pavement, and we were able to make a reconstruction of how it happened. Our objective was to show the closeness of the struggle, the proximity of the two people, and the speed with which it occurred. We produced the video and all we could focus on was the blood. It was terrible. The video did not get offered. The case did not go to trial. Ultimately, the video was helpful in assessing our own case because the reality or the impact of all the blood in the crime scene reached us in the video, even though it did not reach us in the crime scene photos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another case, a famous case that was talked about at this conference last year, Busch v. City of New York, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an emotionally disturbed man was wielding a hammer at police officers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response, four officers fired their guns at Busch. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were standing at various positions on the sidewalk that could be construed as a semi-circle. We wanted to show that the most important aspect of our case was that everybody agreed that he had a hammer and that he &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*904]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had the hammer over his head. There was no dispute about that. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We thought that the issue of whether Busch could have reached the officers with the hammer was crucial to the legal standard of whether or not it was reasonable for the officers to think they could inflict death or serious bodily harm. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were many witnesses on the street when this happened and their testimony sounded as if he was quite far away from the officers. The distances between people and objects were very distorted in the photographs. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The impression was that he could never have reached the officers with a hammer. This was a big problem for us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wanted a reconstruction. We got one. We spent a lot of time with the expert. When we got it, the reconstruction portrayed the fact that the hammer could have reached any one of those officers and inflicted a deadly blow. But it also looked like an execution because the semi-circle of officers with their guns drawn is what appeared on the video earlier. So we scrapped that video. What was effective in that case was having a forensic examiner look at the crime scene and make calculations based on locations. There was unrefuted evidence about ballistics damage, the location of spent shell casings, the location of cars in the area, a fence, and a building. So we had scientific calculations of the bullet trajectories from the various officers' guns. It was very important because through that calculation, the expert was able to testify that Busch was between two and &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*905]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  four feet from the officers at the time he was shot. That put him clearly within range of being able to inflict a deadly blow. What we regretfully did not do, and what I am recommending today, is a demonstration of his testimony. The expert was very good, but it was still difficult for the jury to visualize. We worked for days preparing his testimony so that he would go step-by-step. He had some illustrations that he prepared, but it would have been wonderful if we had video of the bullet trajectories, the location of the police officers, and the person who was shot in the demonstration. That would have allowed the jury to visualize the scientific testimony that was coming in through this forensic examiner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the kind of thing I recommend the lawyer consider in these cases. Decide the key crucial facts that are needed to support the defense to win. What we needed in my last example was the reality of the possibility of death or injury. It is worth it to find a method to demonstrate those facts through forensic evidence and computer animation. I think it is very effective and I think it is a tool that is manageable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another way to do things is to create a still exhibit through computer technology to depict things you do not have photographs of. For example, in another shooting case, the officer was at the top of the stairs while the person that was shot was at the bottom of the stairs. The officer's story was that as he was coming home, he heard someone say, &quot;turn around, you know what this is.&quot; The person pointed an oozie at him from the bottom of the stairs. It was a robbery. As the officer threw down his money and his jewelry, the individual &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*906]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  started to move up the stairs to collect the items. The officer took out his service revolver and shot him and paralyzed him. The plaintiff's version was that he was just walking along the street at night in the rain. He had a plastic water gun in his pants that was an exact replication of an oozie. He bumped into the officer who was walking in the other direction and the plastic oozie fell to the ground. The officer got scared and shot him. So the two versions were radically different in terms of the location and the distance between the officer and the person who was shot. This case went to trial. We could not settle it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c22"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wanted the jury to see what it looked like to the officer when he was confronted. I also wanted to establish that the ballistics evidence supported the distance between the officer and the person who was shot. They were not in close proximity on the sidewalk. There was a crime scene photo of ballistic damage to the lower portion of a door of a car that was parked across the street. A composite image was put together with the cars and the view of the officer from the top of the steps to try to convey the trajectory that the bullet took when it hit the car. There was a pink car and also a silver car across the street. We argued that the ballistic damage could not have occurred had the plaintiff and the defendant been in close proximity on the sidewalk. We had another image to show that if the officer was coming in from the street, as alleged, he would not have bumped into the individual because he would have had a clear view of the sidewalk given the cars parked on the street. These were simple exhibits, but we needed to have the expert who prepared them testify at trial about &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[*907]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the measurements he made, about the software he used, and about what these exhibits represented. The judge in particular was very, very meticulous in making sure that there was a solid evidentiary foundation. My recommendation is to think small, but definitely consider these tools because they are very helpful in allowing a jury to visualize the event. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you.</SPAN></P>

Justice Stevens pointed to the fact that the film obscured the portion of the car chase that took place on a four-lane highway, not a two-lane highway. This would affect the &quot;dangerousness&quot; element of the legal inquiry. He also explained how the film's distance from traffic lights made it difficult to discern the color of the signals, also relevant to dangerousness. He then criticized the court's minimization of the significance of the police sirens because the sound recording on the film was low, possibly because of soundproofing in the officer's vehicle.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pair of Bay Area lawmakers want to increase accountability and public oversight for BART police in the wake of an officer's fatal shooting of an unarmed man early on New Year's Day in Oakland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Leland Yee, D-San Francisco, and Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, D-San Francisco, issued a joint statement Thursday announcing they'll introduce a bill &quot;that will finally ensure an independent oversight body is established, public input is accepted, complaints and grievances are fairly considered, and responsible action is taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART was created in 1957 as a result of state legislation, with governance granted to an elected board of directors, the two lawmakers note. But the board has not provided a proper mechanism for public input and comment on BART police policy, they say: &quot;Unlike the San Francisco Police Commission, BART lacks any real means for the public to air their grievances regarding police conduct or for an independent body that can propose corrective actions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Complaints and grievances against BART police officers have been investigated and adjudicated internally without any independent review,&quot; the lawmakers wrote. &quot;This is a classic case of the fox guarding the hen house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART police Officer Johannes Mehserle's fatal shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III, of Hayward, in the Fruitvale BART station on New Year's Day   witnessed by scores of passengers, and captured on cell-phone videos that have aired nationwide   &quot;is extremely tragic and disturbing,&quot; Yee and Ammiano said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although all the evidence surrounding this case is not yet known, the video footage is beyond troubling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence and property destruction in downtown Oakland this week is inexcusable, but it was predictable when BART police and the Alameda County district attorney treated the New Year's Day killing of an unarmed young man like any other officer-involved shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of Oakland cannot allow roving bands of angry demonstrators to destroy the property of hard-working business people, many of whom are just as outraged as the protesters about the killing of 22-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III as he lay face down on the BART platform. Protesting by burning cars, destroying storefront windows, hurling bottles at officers and trashing patrol vehicles is simply unacceptable behavior. Police acted appropriately by moving quickly to arrest law-breakers and quell the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, there are serious problems with an investigative process that allows BART police to probe the behavior of its own members with little oversight. Officially, District Attorney Tom Orloff is conducting a parallel investigation, but it appears that he is deferring to BART police to take the lead. Orloff has assigned just one attorney and one investigator to the case -- and his people have yet to interview the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the investigations move at a plodding pace, residents have seen repeated airing of video showing an officer pulling out his gun and firing a fatal shot into the back of an unarmed man. The question is not whether a crime was committed; only whether it was accidental or deliberate. It's hard to believe that if the perpetrator in this case were anyone but a police officer that it would have taken this long to arrest and charge him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citizens, from the unacceptable marauders on the streets to outraged East Bay residents and patrons of BART, are rightfully demanding action. If Orloff won't do his job, state and federal agencies must step in -- and quickly. Meanwhile, as outraged as they may be, members of the community must remain calm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE VIOLENCE and property destruction in downtown Oakland this week is inexcusable, but it was predictable when BART police and the Alameda County district attorney treated the New Year's Day killing of an unarmed young man like any other officer-involved shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of Oakland cannot let roving bands of angry demonstrators destroy the property of hardworking business people and innocent residents, many of whom are just as outraged as the protesters about the killing of 22-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III as he lay face down on the BART Fruitvale station platform just two hours into the new year. Protesting by burning cars, destroying storefront windows, hurling bottles at officers and trashing patrol vehicles is simply unacceptable behavior. Oakland Police acted appropriately Wednesday night by moving quickly to arrest lawbreakers and quell the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The irony here is that these protesters, for example, damaged the storefront of one of the buildings belonging to Geoffrey Peete, an African-American club owner who was among those city and civic leaders who participated in a peaceful protest Wednesday morning calling for action on Grant's killing. Many of the violent demonstrators used the legitimate outrage about the shooting as an excuse to go berserk. These kinds of displays do nothing to aid the process and only serve to further tarnish Oakland's image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, there are serious problems with an investigative process that allows BART police to probe the behavior of its own members. Fortunately, District Attorney Tom Orloff is conducting a parallel investigation, but that inquiry is moving too slowly. Earlier this week, Orloff had assigned just one attorney and one investigator to the case. As public outcry has grown louder, he has added two more investigators and will be receiving additional help from the Oakland Police Department. Still, Orloff expects his probe to take another two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the BART and district attorney investigations move at a plodding pace, residents have seen repeated airing of video showing an officer pulling out his gun and firing a fatal shot into the back of a defenseless man. The question is not who fired the gun. Nor does it seem to be whether a crime was committed; only if it was accidental or deliberate. It's hard to believe that if the perpetrator in this case were anyone but a police officer that it would have taken this long to arrest and charge him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citizens, from the unacceptable marauders on the streets to outraged East Bay residents and patrons of BART, are rightfully demanding action. If it doesn't come soon, state and federal agencies should step in. Meanwhile, as outraged as they may be, members of the community must remain calm.</SPAN></P>

BART police Officer Johannes Mehserle, who fired the fatal shot, has resigned from the force. </SPAN></P>

We believe this situation is going to come to a close and justice will be served. I'm asking you please, please stop it and let justice prevail. Please stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Ron Dellums and other city leaders urged the public to remain peaceful and said the Oakland Police Department will investigate the shooting. The department's role will to be to aide the Alameda County District Attorney's office, which previously had been working exclusively with BART police, in its investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will review what has been done and we will develop our own witnesses as well,&quot; said Oakland police Chief Wayne Tucker. &quot;That's what's intended now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff said he expected a case to be &quot;totally prepared&quot; in about two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know people are unhappy with that,&quot; he said. &quot;I know there's a lot of emotion. I have to sit back and look at this as objectively as I can with all the facts that are available and make the decision   not only whether or not he should be charged, but what offense he should he charged with ... and it's not as simple as most people think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rioting, which police estimate caused at least $150,000 in damage, broke out late Wednesday after an originally peaceful protest about Grant's killing moved from the Fruitvale BART station to the downtown area. Splinter groups   many not related to the original protest   fanned out, breaking store windows, setting fire to at least five cars, including an Oakland police patrol car, and smashing windshields of parked cars, leaving them caved in like crushed eggshells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After using tear gas and corralling rioters on Broadway near 22nd Street about 11 p.m., Oakland police made about 120 arrests for rioting, assault on a police officer, looting, arson, vandalism and other offenses. Some of those detained were found to have drugs and guns, which added to the charges, police said. A 28-year-old Oakland man was arrested for rioting and carrying two semi-automatic guns in his pants pockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Thursday, police were still processing arrest reports. At least 37 of those arrested were found to be from Oakland. Five were from Berkeley, and another five were from San Francisco. Others came from cities all over the map: Fremont, Kensington, Pinole, Hayward, San Leandro, Fairfax, Santa Cruz and even as far away as Santa Clarita in Southern California. One man told police he was from Indianapolis, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ages of those arrested ranged from late teens to mid-30s, police said. Most were male. Those arrested on misdemeanors were cited and released. Others may face felony charges, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearing a repeat performance, some businesses shut down early Thursday. Clorox closed its offices on Broadway at 13th Street and sent workers home at 2 p.m., spokesman Dan Staublin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a precautionary step, given what happened Wednesday night,&quot; he said. &quot;We take the safety of our employees very seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Online warnings flew back and forth on blog sites between people who work or live downtown, cautioning one another to stay inside or lock their doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregory Hunter, Oakland's director of redevelopment and economic development, said that more than 300 business were hit by the rioting. Oakland officials are urging those businesses to work with their insurance companies, Hunter said, but the city will also offer &quot;financial assistance so the burden they are having to face now for repairing windows and even some merchandise that was damaged ... is not (being) faced alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the day, as a standing-room-only crowd spoke out about the shooting at a BART board meeting a few blocks away, more than two dozen downtown merchants   mostly small-business owners already hit hard by the economy   spent hours sweeping glass off sidewalks and store floors, pounding plywood over smashed-out windows, taping large cracks in plate glass doors with clear packing tape, calling glaziers and insurance companies, and shaking their heads in disbelief that people would destroy the property of innocent residents and business owners, all in the name of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People already don't want to move to Oakland or bring businesses here. And here we are in 2009, starting off with change with a new president, and then we have people acting like this,&quot; said a tearful Rev. ElTyna McCree who owns Underground Treasures on 17th Street near Franklin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is really hard, because I love Oakland so much, and I have been a business owner in downtown for 30 years,&quot; she said. &quot;I've never seen anything like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCree's store was untouched, but neighboring businesses were not so lucky. Much of the destruction was concentrated on 17th between Franklin and Harrison streets, where nearly every other business had been hit. Random stores also were attacked along Franklin, on 14th Street and on Telegraph Avenue. Even the recently restored Fox Theater had windows broken and damage to some of the carefully restored historic woodwork and terra cotta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phil Tagami of CCG, the development company restoring the Fox, estimated the damage at $10,000 to $20,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stuff like this happens all the time in San Francisco with all the protests there,&quot; he said. &quot;In Oakland, with our growing urban (center), we will have to learn to live with it. Broken glass can be replaced, the damage to the building can be repaired, and it's good we still have crews working here so they can take care of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of his other buildings, including the Rotunda, were damaged, although storefront windows at the Uptown nightclub and the Fox construction office next door were smashed. Windows were broken at Flora restaurant, which was filled with customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Creative African Braids on 14th Street near Webster, store owner Leemu Tokpa feared for her life and that of her 8-month-old baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was in here, working on a client,&quot; she said Thursday morning through the broken-out windows of her store's front door. &quot;My client had just walked out the door, and I saw a group of black guys across the street. They came running over and started throwing bottles at my windows. They were cussing, using the F-word, trying to force the door open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I couldn't understand it,&quot; she said. &quot;It had nothing to do with what was going on. Nobody feels happy about the guy getting killed at BART, but if they come back to attack me as a black sister, I feel very disappointed, since I'm struggling, too. I had to run in the back to hide and protect my baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tokpa's brother spent the night in the store for fear of more vandalism, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most felt sure the damage was not done by protesters but by splinter groups who just wanted to cause trouble. Elisher Muhammad was unlocking her broken glass door Thursday at Change Hair Studio. She had just moved to 17th Street from Telegraph about a month ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're the people, too. We're Oscar,&quot; she said. &quot;I even went to a protest to speak on his behalf at the courthouse a few days ago. And here I am with this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it was the protesters,&quot; she said. &quot;Even with Oscar's family, his parents, his mom   they're for peace. It's just people who have their own issues and own rage, and they look for an opportunity to disperse that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do you get out of destroying someone else's property? You're still angry at the end of it. So what good did it do?&quot; asked Paulina Blunt, a regular patron on 17th Street. She hugged Mimi Le of Mimi's Fashions and alterations, who has been in business there for 10 years and was outside sweeping glass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a window broken last year,&quot; Le said. &quot;This time is horrible. Last time, it cost me $1,200 for that one window. Now it's two windows. I had considered getting a gate with security bars. That was so expensive. It was $5,000. But now I think I should have.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor's Note: The following is Thursday's updated coverage of fallout from the New Year's Day shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III by a BART police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4 p.m. BART board apologizes to community</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BART board of directors apologized Thursday for the officer-involved shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and agreed to set up a board committee to review police procedures and consider the possibility of creating a BART civilian police review board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following six hours of testimony by 60 speakers, board members said they were personally apologizing for the death of Grant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry&quot; said Gail Murray, a board member from Walnut Creek, in summarizing the sentiments of the bard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joel Keller, a board member from Antioch said he viewed videotapes of the incident and said he saw no reason why the officer should have shot Grant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Denis Cuff, Staff Writer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2:40 p.m. Grant's family condemns violence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members and friends of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III pleaded for peace Thursday afternoon, condemning the violence and rioting that took place Wednesday night in downtown Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family's attorney, John Burris, held a news conference at his office building near the Coliseum at 1:30 p.m. About 30 friends and relatives of Grant, including Grant's mother, Wanda Johnson, attended the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the first time I've spoken to the media, and I am doing it to beg the citizens to not use violent tactics,&quot; Johnson said, becoming emotional. &quot;I know it's a very frustrating time. But Oscar would not want to see the violence and the fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe this situation is going to come to a close and justice will be served. I'm asking you please, please, stop it and let justice prevail. Please stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 p.m. Some worried employers closing early today</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearing a repeat of Wednesday night's rioting in downtown Oakland, prompted by a fatal officer-involved shooting at the Fruitvale BART station on New Year's Day, some businesses closed for the day Thursday or let employees go home early for safety reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employees at the Clorox building at Broadway and 13th Street were told to go home at 4 p.m., in case another violent protest should erupt in the evening hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12:05 p.m. Fox Theater damaged; Oakland merchants clean up after night of vandalism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday night, one group of rioters split off toward Telegraph Avenue and attacked the recently renovated Fox Theater. Phil Tagami of CCG, said windows were broken and there was some damage to woodwork and terra cotta on the Fox building. He estimated the damage at somewhere between $10,000 and $20,000. He was diplomatic about it and said it was inconvenient more than anything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stuff like this happens all the time in San Francisco with all the protests there,&quot; he said. &quot; In Oakland, with our growing urban (center), we will have to learn to live with it. Broken glass can be replaced, the damage to the building can be repaired and it's good we still have crews working here so they can take care of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of his other buildings, including the Rotunda, were damaged, although storefront windows at the Uptown nightclub and the Fox construction office next door were smashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, merchants in the area continued cleaning up glass today and called insurance companies throughout the morning. Most felt sure the damage was not caused by those involved in the main protest, but by splinter groups who just wanted to cause trouble. But the damage was done nonetheless. And not just to property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People already don't want to move to Oakland or bring businesses here. And here we are in 2009, starting off with change with a new president, and then we have people acting like this,&quot; said the Rev. ElTyna McCree who owns Underground Treasures on 17th Street near Franklin. Her store was intact, but she was shocked at the scene at neighboring businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been here 15 years in this location. We never have this kind of situation going on. I'm hyperventilating to see all these cars mutilated and these broken windows of my fellow business owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have removed traffic cones around the Kaiser Center, where the BART board of directors is meeting. Traffic is now being allowed on 20th and Webster streets, and Lakeside Drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area is calm, but police are maintaining a presence around the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Angela Hill, Harry Harris, Staff Writers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11:20 a.m., BART board gets an earful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BART board of directors has been meeting for two hours, listening to speakers talk about the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III on New Year's Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside, OPD has streets blocked around the Kaiser Center on 20th Street, where BART's headquarters are located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few dozen speakers thus far have addressed the BART board at the Kaiser building in downtown Oakland. Several more are waiting to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's packed in the main board room, which has a capacity of 140 people. Side rooms have been set up to accommodate the overflow. Some have complained BART hasn't done enough to let people in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his remarks, Mandingo Hayes of Oakland pointed to a police officer in the back of the room, and said &quot;Officer, just because I look like this, don't mean I intend to do something violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What you seen last night, that was pain,&quot; Hayes said. &quot;You call them thugs, but that was pain. People is tired, don't you understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He apologized for having hoarse voice. &quot;It was from all my hollering last night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nedir Bey, adopted son of late Your Black Muslin Bakery founder Yusef Bey, told the BART board that he was pleased by the rioting Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope BART gets shut down. Eye for an eye, that what I believe and if the young soldiers believe it, God bless them,&quot; Bey said. &quot;If it was my business on fire, I would bless them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the meeting started, BART board President Thomas Blalock called for moment of silence for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III. During the pledge of the allegiance, everyone stood, hands on hearts. At the end of the pledge, however, someone repeated, 'Yea justice for all'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amos Brown, on the national board for NAACP, senior minister at the Third Baptist church in San Francisco, asked the board for three items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need embrace a reverence and respect for every human life,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, &quot;BART in tandem should join with this audience in saying that was murder; don't explain it away as a mistake,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Brown asked for &quot;Fruits for repentance&quot;   meaning major contracts for black contractors from BART.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sean Maher, Denis Cuff, Staff Writers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10:30 a.m., Police estimate damages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police estimate damages to property from Wednesday night vandalism is $150,000, but the total could go higher as they assess damages. About 25 cars were badly vandalized, including some police cars and city vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the 105 arrested last night were in the area surrounded by 14th and 20 streets, and San Pablo and Broadway, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to drugs seized from some individuals, two guns were recovered from those arrested. Charges include assault on a police officer, looting, vandalism, rioting and arson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, none of those arrested have yet been charged by the District Attorney, and those arrested on misdemeanors have been cited and released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those arrested for felonies are still being held, but the number hasn't been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police are meeting with the DA today to talk about possibly taking over the investigation into the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III. The investigation is now being conducted by the BART police department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say they have beefed up staffing around the city for the rest of the day, and will respond to any incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We understand it's a very sensitive touchy situation and people need an outlet. In our society that's what's protesting is all about as long as it's peaceful,&quot; Thomason said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a group of individuals who wanted to vandalize, assault police officers and riot. We are not going to stand for that. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Harry Harris, Staff Writer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9:10 a.m., BART Board meeting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BART board of directors is now meeting, attended by about 100 people, with the topic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III's shooting death at the top of the agenda. BART board President Thomas Blalock proposed setting up a committee comprised by four members to address major police incidents, although no action could be taken on the item today because of open meeting laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the first venting of concern in a public meeting of the New Year's Day incident and speakers are now addressing the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland City Councilmember Desley Brooks told the board that she was angered by the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III on New Year's Day, but didn't condone the havoc wrought by Wednesday night's &quot;renegade groups&quot; on the streets of Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a need to focus one's anger,&quot; Brooks said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supervisor Keith Carson asked the board for a public review of policies and procedures that BART police use during arrests, and asked that the coroner's report on Grant's death be made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sean Maher, Staff Writer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7 a.m. Cleanup begins in downtown Oakland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As storekeepers clean up after a night of vandalism and protests in downtown Oakland, police are bracing for more protests this morning after at least 105 people were arrested for a variety of offenses Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said charges for those arrested included assault on a police officer, looting, vandalism and arson. Some of those detained were found to have drugs, which added another count to the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angry about the New Year's Day shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III by a BART police officer, protesters smashed businesses and set fires in downtown Oakland, and confronted Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums on the steps of City Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses downtown are cleaning up this morning, dealing with the aftermath of smashed windows and cars and trash strewed on streets and sidewalks. The damage appears random on some streets, but two blocks of 17th Street between Franklin and Harrison streets were hard hit. Passers-by are shaking their heads as they survey the smashed windows of a tattoo parlor, smoothie shop, cafe, braid studio and fashion design store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leemu Tokpa had swept glass shards into two piles outside her shop, Creative African Braids, on 14th Street so that clients could get in the door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said a group of vandals smashed up her downtown Oakland shop and threw bottles at her while she was holding her 8-month-old baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was working on a client in her business, Creative African Braids on 14th Street, when a group of black males came over and started swearing and smashing her windows. She shouted at them, saying 'Why are you doing this?' Tokpa said. That's when one threw a bottle at her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had to run in the back to hide. They were cussing, saying the F-word and trying to force the door open,&quot; Tokpa said. &quot;It had nothing to do with (the BART shooting).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody feels happy about the guy getting killed, but if they come back to attack me as a black sister I feel very disappointed. I'm struggling here too. And they come and wreck my business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her brother slept in the shop all night, to protect it from further vandalism she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstration began peacefully Wednesday afternoon at the Fruitvale BART station, but the station was eventually closed from 3 to 7 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland's downtown stations at Lake Merritt and Oakland City Center were also temporarily closed because of protests. Windows were smashed at a McDonalds restaurant at 14th and Jackson streets, and Dumpsters were set afire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Oakland police are hoping protests will be less violent, but plan to have extra officers on the streets and will be in riot gear. A protest is expected outside BART headquarters, where the agency's board meeting will be held at 9 a.m.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation into a BART police officer's fatal shooting of an unarmed, prone man is likely to ripple beyond local police and county prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, when a relatively green Oakland police officer shot to death a man while conducting a pat-down search in 1976, an internal investigation deemed the death accidental and the Alameda County grand jury declined to indict him. A two-year federal civil-rights investigation ensued, also ending without criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a veteran Modesto Police SWAT officer shot and killed an 11-year-old boy during a drug raid in 2000, the internal investigation's finding that the death was accidental was reviewed not only by the Stanislaus County District Attorney but by the state Attorney General's office, too; though no criminal charges were ever filed, the city eventually paid the boy's family $2.25 million to settle a civil lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART police Officer Johannes Mehserle, 27, shot and killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III, 22, of Hayward in the wee hours of New Year's Day in the Fruitvale BART station, as Grant lay facedown and unarmed on the platform. Scores of witnesses saw it, and several cell-phone videos of the shooting have aired nationwide. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Klinger, an associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri, St. Louis and author of &quot;Into the Kill Zone: A Cop's Eye View of Deadly Force,&quot; said that at least three levels of review are likely to occur in a case like this. First, BART police will try to determine whether officers' actions complied with the agency's use-of-force policies, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That first review might be stymied: Mehserle has refused to be interviewed, and his attorney delivered a letter of resignation to BART police officials Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klinger said that's not odd. Under the U.S. Supreme Court's 1967 ruling in Garrity v. New Jersey, an officer can be compelled to give a statement for administrative purposes, although nothing in that statement can be used against him or her in a criminal prosecution, he said; by quitting, Mehserle removed the department's power to compel any statement at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four New York Police Department officers who fired 41 rounds at unarmed Amadou Diallo in 1999 never gave statements to department investigators until after their criminal trial had concluded more than a year after the slaying, Klinger noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a situation like this where it looks pretty evident that there could be concern about criminal culpability, police officers like everyone else have a Fifth Amendment right   they cannot be compelled to give a statement which could incriminate them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that criminal inquiry   the second level of investigation in such cases, Klinger said   has begun under the auspices of the Alameda County District Attorney's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">District Attorney Tom Orloff said Thursday that he will decide within two weeks whether to file criminal charges against Mehserle. He made the announcement during a news conference at Oakland City Hall, at which Mayor Ron Dellums announced that the Oakland Police Department will join with Orloff's office in investigating the shooting; BART police Chief Gary Gee was there as well, voicing support for the city's involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in the Modesto case, the state Attorney General's office sometimes gets involved either during or after local prosecutors' review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've received a letter from George Holland from the local NAACP branch and I've received a letter from (NAACP California State Conference President) Alice Huffman,&quot; Attorney General Jerry Brown said Thursday evening. &quot;They're concerned the local authorities can't be trusted to do a complete and thorough investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to talk to Alice Huffman tomorrow, but I have been in touch with Tom Orloff yesterday and today. There are now three agencies investigating this   BART, Oakland and the D.A. I'm monitoring this very carefully, and I will certainly take action if I feel justice is not being served.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Respect for the law is the bedrock of our country, the law has to be respected by everyone, otherwise we're really in trouble,&quot; Brown added. &quot;There's a tendency to add more and more layers, which doesn't produce a more effective investigation. I'm confident Tom Orloff will do the best job he can, and if people have evidence that he doesn't, I'm sure they'll make that known.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A final review can come from the federal government if the Justice Department determines that there has been a civil rights violation bringing the case under federal jurisdiction, Klinger said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as I know, nobody's requested we take a look at it, but we will monitor the situation just because of the potential for a civil rights violation,&quot; Special Agent Joe Schadler, spokesman for the FBI office in San Francisco, said Wednesday evening, noting that the bureau typically will not act until all local and state investigations have run their course. A U.S. Attorney's office spokesman said federal prosecutors eventually would decide whether to act on whatever evidence the FBI might bring them, but they have taken no independent investigation of their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike earlier local deadly-force controversies, this one was witnessed by scores of people and recorded on several cell-phone cameras and since has been viewed by millions. Having these images in the public domain instantaneously serves the public's right to know, but it also sparks powerful emotional responses   such as the rioting that struck Oakland on Wednesday night   and can complicate the official process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's a major change,&quot; said Samuel Walker, a professor emeritus of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and the author of 11 books on policing, criminal justice history and policy, and civil liberties. &quot;The first step in this was Rodney King in 1991, when there was a video camera. That's not so common, but cell phone cameras are now almost universal. It adds some independent documentation to these incidents. They're not perfect by any means, but it adds some documentation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, he said, &quot;the investigation should be independent and professional regardless of what's in the news media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klinger agreed that investigators must rely on other officers' and witnesses' statements as well as physical evidence including ballistics tests, &quot;and then these video clips hopefully straight from the cell phones   so then we know it's in the original form, it hasn't been clipped or cut   come into the investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of public outcry over the videos, &quot;the investigation should be walled off from public influence &quot;... and the investigators should simply go out and do a good job,&quot; he said. Still, &quot;it makes it more difficult in terms of   once the investigation is complete   what deliberative bodies are going to look at this, how they are going to be influenced by all these people ranting and raving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of South Carolina and a use-of-force expert, agreed with Klinger that the videos should not affect local, state and federal officials' eventual decisions whether to prosecute based on the investigation's result   but they might anyway: &quot;Public opinion plays a bigger part in politics than we want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alpert also noted that although Mehserle's resignation effectively ends whatever administrative action might have been pursued against him by BART police, &quot;that doesn't mean training (officers) shouldn't look into the event and see what they can learn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown appealed for calm Thursday. &quot;Burning police cars doesn't help bring this investigation to a close, breaking the windows of innocent businesses and a school &quot;... certainly doesn't compensate, it just compounds the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE UNREST that engulfed downtown Oakland on Wednesday night was not a full-blown riot. But it was close enough that for a few minutes I was really frightened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest started peacefully at the Fruitvale BART station, where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III was shot to death early Jan. 1. His shooting by BART police Officer Johannes Mehserle   captured in chilling detail on video and broadcast nationwide   ignited the outrage and frustration that erupted Wednesday night and tore through several city blocks. Grant's death just triggered the bitterness and a sense of unfairness that has welled up over time. Person after person said he was angry that no action has been taken against Mehserle, at least as far as anyone knows. The indignation of the crowd was like a smoldering volcano, and it erupted Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters who broke away from the Fruitvale group and marched to the Lake Merritt BART station then down Eighth Street left in their wake a damaged Oakland Police Department car, overturned Dumpsters and decaying vegetables strewed in the roadways. The acrid smell of burning garbage and what someone told me was tear gas filled the air. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the 12th Street BART station, at least 100 law enforcement officers surrounded about as many demonstrators. I was wondering how long Oakland police would remain calm as a band of demonstrators tried to provoke them, yelling insults and demanding their grievances over brutality and officer-involved shootings be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then police slipped respirator masks over their faces and formed a line along 14th Street and Broadway. My heart was pounding in my chest when a handful charged forward, to grab a demonstrator it turned out. I have stood feet from other police as they hooded and shackled two men on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley and another time UC police looked like they would break the leg and arm of a protester as they handcuffed him. I was afraid of what would happen if Oakland police let loose. I ran with the pack of protesters, reporters and camera crews, a couple who had donned hard hats to protect them from the projectiles being hurled toward police. It was hard to tell whether police were pushing protesters down 14th Street toward Lake Merritt or pursuing them slowly   particularly the small group who went on a rampage and chanted &quot;Murder! Murder! Murder!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like some kind of insane cat-and-mouse game, they taunted police by burning vehicles and smashing in car windows, one after another along 14th, 15th and Madison streets down to Lake Merritt and back again. The line of police stood just feet from the bright orange flames engulfing a car that had been set afire, creating a chilling silhouette. The owners of Creative African Braids came running out shortly after their store windows were smashed. The woman had a baby in her arms and a look of bafflement mixed with outrage on her face. Police with small canisters of tear gas strapped to their chests began chasing protesters in a Humvee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scene reminded me of the 1992 Rodney King uprising that broke out in Los Angeles. I was fresh back from Germany, and my blood froze at the sight of tanks rolling through the streets of a Southern California city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland on Wednesday night, people chanted &quot;We want justice!&quot;   the same demand that sent rioters into the streets of Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time someone is brutalized or killed by police, they are told to be calm,&quot; said a man who only gave his name as B. Rex when I asked him how to explain the destruction. It was a response to a systematic problem, he said. &quot;If you don't get attention, nothing is going to change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not going to go away!&quot; a man yelled at Mayor Ron Dellums, who had arrived with city officials and his bodyguard a couple of hours after the demonstration began to try to calm the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a peace march! Calm down,&quot; someone shouted to the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know if there was anything that anyone could say to calm the crowd, who wanted nothing less than to see Mehserle in jail now during the investigations into the shooting. That is something beyond the power of Oakland officials. When Dellums turned and headed into City Hall after speaking, the violence erupted again. Protesters smashed the car window an Oakland Tribune reporter along with four City of Oakland vehicles parked outside I.B.'s Hoagies &amp; Cheesesteaks shop on 16th and San Pablo Avenue. Windows at the eatery also were broken. Police finally fired tear gas, one canister soaring through the sky like a comet. As I walked along Broadway, patrons of the Van Kleef Cafe stared out from behind a metal gate lowered for protection, and at nearby Flora's restaurant customers were afraid to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young people are upset and have learned to solve problems with violence from adults, said Arnold Perkins, former Alameda County Public Health Department director who has aided the mayor on public safety issues. &quot;They are a weather vane of what is happening in society as a whole.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oakland Police Department will investigate the shooting of an unarmed man on a BART train as officials face public clamor for answers in the New Year's Day shooting that has led to massive protests in the streets of Oakland, officials announced Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OPD's role will to be to aid the Alameda County District Attorney's office, which had previously been working exclusively with BART police, to determine whether criminal charges against the officer who pulled the trigger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will review what has been done and we will develop our own witnesses as well,&quot; said Oakland police Chief Wayne Tucker. &quot;That's what's intended now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART Police Chief Gary Gee welcomed the additional resources the Oakland Police Department will provide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I fully support his partnership,&quot; he said. &quot;The BART and Oakland police departments have always enjoyed an excellent working relationship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff said he expected a case to be &quot;totally prepared&quot; in about two weeks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the former BART officer involved in the shooting, Johannes Mehserle, has, through his attorney, refused to be interviewed by Orloff's office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearing a repeat of Wednesday night's rioting in downtown Oakland, prompted by a fatal officer-involved shooting at the Fruitvale BART station on New Year's Day, some businesses closed for the day Thursday or let employees go home early for safety reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employees at the Clorox building at Broadway and 13th Street were told to go home at 4 p.m., in case another violent protest should erupt in the evening hours.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday night, one group of rioters split off toward Telegraph Avenue and attacked the recently renovated Fox Theater. Phil Tagami of CCG, said windows were broken and there was some damage to woodwork and terra cotta on the Fox building. He estimated the damage at somewhere between $10,000 and $20,000. He was diplomatic about it and said it was inconvenient more than anything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stuff like this happens all the time in San Francisco with all the protests there,&quot; he said. &quot; In Oakland, with our growing urban (center), we will have to learn to live with it. Broken glass can be replaced, the damage to the building can be repaired and it's good we still have crews working here so they can take care of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of his other buildings, including the Rotunda, were damaged, although storefront windows at the Uptown nightclub and the Fox construction office next door were smashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, merchants in the area continued cleaning up glass today and called insurance companies throughout the morning. Most felt sure the damage was not caused by those involved in the main protest, but by splinter groups who just wanted to cause trouble. But the damage was done nonetheless. And not just to property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People already don't want to move to Oakland or bring businesses here. And here we are in 2009, starting off with change with a new president, and then we have people acting like this,&quot; said the Rev. ElTyna McCree who owns Underground Treasures on 17th Street near Franklin. Her store was intact, but she was shocked at the scene at neighboring businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been here 15 years in this location. We never have this kind of situation going on. I'm hyperventilating to see all these cars mutilated and these broken windows of my fellow business owners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside, OPD has streets blocked around the Kaiser Center on 20th Street, where BART's headquarters are located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few dozen speakers thus far have addressed the BART board at the Kaiser building in downtown Oakland. Several more are waiting to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's packed in the main board room, which has a capacity of 140 people. Side rooms have been set up to accommodate the overflow. Some have complained BART hasn't done enough to let people in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his remarks, Mandingo Hayes of Oakland pointed to a police officer in the back of the room, and said &quot;Officer, just because I look like this, don't mean I intend to do something violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What you seen last night, that was pain,&quot; Hayes said. &quot;You call them thugs, but that was pain. People is tired, don't you understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He apologized for having hoarse voice. &quot;It was from all my hollering last night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nedir Bey, adopted son of late Your Black Muslin Bakery founder Yusef Bey, told the BART board that he was pleased by the rioting Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope BART gets shut down. Eye for an eye, that's what I believe and if the young soldiers believe it, God bless them,&quot; Bey said. &quot;If it was my business on fire, I would bless them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the meeting started, BART board president Thomas Blalock called for moment of silence for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III. During the pledge of the allegiance, everyone stood, hands on hearts. At the end of the pledge, however, someone repeated, 'Yea justice for all'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amos Brown, on the national board for NAACP, senior minister at the Third Baptist church in San Francisco, asked the board for three items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need embrace a reverence and respect for every human life,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, &quot;BART in tandem should join with this audience in saying that was murder; don't explain it away as a mistake,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Brown asked for &quot;Fruits for repentance&quot; - meaning major contracts for black contractors from BART.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10:30 a.m. Police estimate damages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police estimate damages to property from Wednesday night vandalism is $150,000, but the total could go higher as they assess damages. About 25 cars were badly vandalized, including some police cars and city vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the 105 arrested last night were in the area surrounded by 14th and 20 streets, and San Pablo and Broadway, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to drugs seized from some individuals, two guns were recovered from those arrested. Charges include assault on a police officer, looting, vandalism, rioting and arson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, none of those arrested have yet been charged by the District Attorney, and those arrested on misdemeanors have been cited and released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those arrested for felonies are still being held, but the number hasn't been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police are meeting with the DA today to talk about possibly taking over the investigation into the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III. The investigation is now being conducted by the BART police department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say they have beefed up staffing around the city for the rest of the day, and will respond to any incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We understand it's a very sensitive touchy situation and people need an outlet. In our society that's what's protesting is all about as long as it's peaceful,&quot; Thomason said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a group of individuals who wanted to vandalize, assault police officers and riot. We are not going to stand for that. &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BART board of directors is now meeting, attended by about 100 people, with the topic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III's shooting death at the top of the agenda. BART board president Thomas Blalock proposed setting up a committee comprised by four members to address major police incidents, although no action could be taken on the item today because of open meeting laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the first venting of concern in a public meeting of the New Year's Day incident and speakers are now addressing the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland City Councilmember Desley Brooks told the board that she was angered by the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III on New Year's Day, but didn't condone the havoc wrought by Wednesday night's &quot;renegade groups&quot; on the streets of Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a need to focus one's anger,&quot; Brooks said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supervisor Keith Carson asked the board for a public review of policies and procedures that BART police use during arrests, and asked that the coroner's report on Grant's death be made publi</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7 a.m. Cleanup begins in downtown Oakland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As storekeepers clean up after a night of vandalism and protests in downtown Oakland, police are bracing for more protests this morning after at least 105 people were arrested for a variety of offenses Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said charges for those arrested included assault on a police officer, looting, vandalism and arson. Some of those detained were found to have drugs, which added another count to the charges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses downtown are cleaning up this morning, dealing with the aftermath of smashed windows and cars and trash strewn on streets and sidewalks. The damage appears random on some streets, but two blocks of 17th Street between Franklin and Harrison streets were hard hit. Passers-by are shaking their heads as they survey the smashed windows of a tattoo parlor, smoothie shop, cafe, braid studio and fashion design store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leemu Tokpa had swept glass shards into two piles outside her shop, Creative African Braids, on 14th Street so that clients could get in the door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said a group of vandals smashed up her downtown Oakland shop and threw bottles at her while she was holding her 8-month-old baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was working on a client in her business, Creative African Braids on 14th Street, when a group of black males came over and started swearing and smashing her windows. She shouted at them, saying 'Why are you doing this?' Tokpa said. That's when one threw a bottle at her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had to run in the back to hide. They were cussing, saying the f-word and trying to force the door open,&quot; Tokpa said. &quot;It had nothing to do with (the BART shooting).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody feels happy about the guy getting killed, but if they come back to attack me as a black sister I feel very disappointed. I'm struggling here too. And they come and wreck my business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her brother slept in the shop all night, to protect it from further vandalism she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstration began peacefully Wednesday afternoon at the Fruitvale BART station, but the station was eventually closed from 3 to 7 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland's downtown stations at Lake Merritt and Oakland City Center were also temporarily closed because of protests. Windows were smashed at a McDonalds restaurant at 14th and Jackson streets, and Dumpsters were set afire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Oakland police are hoping protests will be less violent, but plan to have extra officers on the streets and will be in riot gear. A protest is expected outside BART headquarters, where the agency's board meeting will be held at 9 a.m.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND   An emotional BART board apologized Thursday for the death of an unarmed passenger who was shot in the back by a transit police officer on New Year's Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to a public outcry over the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III at the Fruitvale BART station, the transit board also vowed to create a new committee to look into police issues and consider the possibility of setting up a civilian police review board for the transit agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART board members   some with voices cracking with emotion   apologized for the death of Grant, a 22-year-old black man, as he lay on his stomach at a train platform where police had ordered several riders to the ground following a dispute among riders on a train. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what the community needs to hear is that we apologize to his family,&quot; Bob Franklin, a BART board member from Oakland, said after hearing 60 public speakers over six hours denounce the shooting. &quot;As a board member, I apologize.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other directors agreed, saying that they are distraught over Grant's death and feel sorry even if they have been reluctant to comment on details of the investigation into the shooting, which was recorded by several riders' cell phone cameras and posted on the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That young man did nothing wrong that should have caused him to lose his life that morning,&quot; said BART board member Joel Keller of Antioch. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board will hold a special meeting soon to create a new public safety committee to look into police issues such as officer training and hiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART board member Tom Radulovich of San Francisco proposed that the new board committee look into creating a civilian police review board to monitor police activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board members' statements   and their adjournment of their meeting in Grant's honor   came after many public speakers crowded into the meeting and expressed outrage about the shooting. More than 200 people attended, exceeding the room capacity and prompting authorities to keep some people outside until others left and room opened for newcomers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several speakers demanded the immediate arrest of the officer involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seek out and arrest that man so you can bring charges on him,&quot; said Keith Muhammad, a local minister for the Nation of Islam. &quot;He must not be given the chance to get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannes Mehserle, a former BART police officer who quit his job Wednesday, is under investigation by BART and the Alameda County district attorney's office in the shooting of Grant. In several witness videos, an unarmed Grant appears to be facedown on the ground when Mehserle appears to draw his gun and shoot Grant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART board members said they could not take any action related to the shooting Thursday because they had not placed it on the agenda to give the required public notice before acting. However, the board agreed to listen to everyone who spoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amos Brown, minister for the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco, and Charlie Walker, a Hunters Point activist and trucker, demanded that BART provide large contracts to black-owned businesses, saying the shooting reflected larger problems in how the black community is treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several speakers derided the news media for their conduct before and after the shooting. Some accused the coverage of the black community, or lack thereof, of being racist and stereotyping black people as violent and destructive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You should be ashamed of yourself. You're sick,&quot; Walker said. &quot;You need to look at yourself when you say, 'If you (blacks) ain't killing each other, we ain't gone show up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overall focus of most comments, however, was on the racial element of the Grant shooting. Several speakers said they thought Grant never would have been bothered at all if he were white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not even clear </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a suspect of anything, so his even being taken aside in the first place was wrong,&quot; Muhammad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his remarks, Oakland resident Mandingo Hayes pointed to a police officer in the back of the room and said, &quot;Officer, just because I look like this, don't mean I intend to do something violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What you seen last night, that was pain,&quot; Hayes said, referring to rioting Wednesday night. &quot;You call them thugs, but that was pain. People is tired, don't you understand?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hayes apologized for his hoarse voice: &quot;It's from all my hollering last night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nedir Bey, adopted son of late Your Black Muslin Bakery founder Yusef Bey, told the BART board that he was pleased by the rioting Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope BART gets shut down. ... Eye for an eye, that's what I believe, and if the young soldiers believe it, bless them,&quot; he said. &quot;I love what they did. If it was my business on fire, I would bless them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bey joined the chorus of speakers asking why Mehserle has not been arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What does it take to have a white cop arrested?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART spokesman Linton Johnson said outside the meeting that he understood the public's frustration but explained that a full criminal investigation would require more than simply citing the cell phone videos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They think, 'We can see it. It's on video, and we can see what happened,'&quot; Johnson said. &quot;But the courts say you need to find other things that you didn't see on the tape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rita Jones, a 53-year-old Oakland schoolteacher, said she had taught her children as her parents had taught her to trust the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I told them, 'Go to the police when you have a problem,'&quot; she said. &quot;But now I'm a grandmother, and some of my grandchildren are boys. And I cannot in my heart tell them the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland Councilmember Desley Brooks presented written demands that BART create a citizens review board to monitor BART police, request that the California attorney general investigate the shooting, and identify and investigate all officers present at the shooting that night for possible misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also asked that BART improve public communications about the shooting investigation and conduct hearings to explain BART policies on police hiring, training, use of force, diversity, de-escalation and other issues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against a cacophony of police choppers overhead, sirens in the distance and jabbering TV reporters, Noah Mitchell sat outside Oakland's Kaiser Center on Thursday at lunchtime, filled with both anger and sorrow for the town he has always called home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love Oakland,&quot; he said, as the streets around him teemed with outrage over the New Year's Day shooting by a BART police officer of an unarmed man. &quot;But it's a troubled place. And I feel like this city won't change for long, long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside, the BART board of directors sat like a punching bag for a community tirade against perceived police brutality. It was a reaction borne of embers reignited by the incident at the Fruitvale BART station, now churning endlessly through the YouTube portal of eyewitness news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Mitchell and others, either those protesting in the streets or supporters cheering them on from their living rooms, the true import of this moment transcends a tragic incident on a train-station platform. Mitchell is barely in his 20s, born and raised in an epicenter of America's racial struggles, part African-American, and just black enough to know what it feels like to really love-hate Oakland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I once got pulled through the window of my car by an Oakland police officer,&quot; he said in a soft, meek voice. &quot;Ever since, every time I see a police officer, I'm scared it'll happen again. But it's more than that. It's the everyday rudeness, like when I ask for directions, they joke it off, laugh at me, and walk on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lingering protests and scattered nighttime violence downtown this week surprised a lot of people, as if the bold response seemed out of sync with the shooting. But even though the victim was from Hayward, and the incident took place on BART property and involved BART police, the story line for many has moved on   to Oakland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's an accident of geography that the riots took place here and that the focus is now on Oakland,&quot; said Steven Lavoie, longtime city resident and librarian at the Oakland History Room at the main library. &quot;The problems between law enforcement and minority communities are not unique to Oakland. But because of our large minority population, these issues come to a head here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oakland,&quot; he said, &quot;is the venue for much larger social problems. And I don't think the people of the privileged class, of which I'm probably a member, understand the impact of injustice in this community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of justice came up again and again at the BART board meeting. Looking stunned by the barrage of criticism, the mostly white-male board found itself the lightning rod for a homegrown bitterness 60 years in the making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope you hear what the community is saying to you,&quot; said Ken Nelson, president of the Richmond branch of the NAACP, one of several speakers calling for a state investigation into the shooting, and imploring the board to improve officer training. &quot;You can't be quiet anymore. This must be corrected immediately, or we'll continue to have flare-ups. Your silence means approval. Please do not continue to remain silent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson was asking the board to speak out, but he could have been addressing each of the 400,000 people who call Oak Town home. Oakland is and always has been a bifurcated place, with wealthier and whiter residents in the hills, poorer people of color in the flatlands, and each group able to spend entire lifetimes largely confined to one area or the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a crowd of people waited outside the front doors, locked by security officers because the conference room was already packed, local businessman Frank Tucker implored the BART board to seize the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, you've got people down there trying to break down the doors to speak to you today, and nothing's being done to let them inside,&quot; said Tucker, a board member of the city's African-American Chamber of Commerce. &quot;This is a metaphor of what's been happening on a larger scale in Oakland for years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historian Lavoie said you can trace the history of troubled relations between Oakland minorities and police to the 1950s, when the lure of post-World War II jobs brought African-Americans from the South, as well as white Southerners, many of whom would put on uniform and badge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tension that resulted had a lot to do with who was hired, because a lot of the people from the South brought attitudes with them,&quot; he said. &quot;Blacks, but also whites not willing to be as tolerant as Oakland historically had been.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lavoie says relations between police and minorities have dramatically improved since the 1960s, when the Black Panthers formed to patrol the streets, ostensibly to police the police. Despite this week's flare of street violence, &quot;what you should look at is how police responded Wednesday night, versus how they went after peace marchers in the '60s. There's a huge difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And BART spokesman Linton Johnson, who said his own aunt had been roughed up by a Los Angeles cop years ago, defended the agency's police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They care about the public and they've done a wonderful job keeping BART safe for everyone,&quot; he said. &quot;There have been only five officer-involved shootings resulting in injury or death in BART's 36 years. The officers do a hell of a job protecting the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet many still see police as intimidating. Oakland native and college student Tahirah Rasheed waved a &quot;STOP POLICE BRUTALITY&quot; placard outside the board meeting, saying &quot;the police are modern-day slave patrollers.&quot; She's seen the homemade videos of the shooting, which apparently show officer Johannes Mehserle firing his weapon at 22-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III as he lay face-down on the platform. She says she doesn't need to see anything else. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those videos, which have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, are a study in chaos, as the shooting unfolds in front of dozens of train passengers returning home after New Year's Eve celebrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to reports of young men fighting on a train, BART police arrived shortly after midnight, taking Grant and several others off the train for questioning. The images show Grant pushed onto his stomach shortly before Mehserle fired his gun at Grant's back. The bullet ricocheted off the pavement and pierced his lung.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fueled by the footage, a debate has raged over whether the officer knowingly shot Grant, as the victim's family believes, or may have tragically mistaken his handgun for a stun gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those arguments now seem lost on Rasheed and others who see the incident as part of something much bigger, no matter how much some people feel police relations with Oakland's minorities may have improved over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This shooting,&quot; said Rasheed, &quot;is the culmination of decades of&quot; bad relations between police and citizens. &quot;That BART officer should be arrested and in jail, just like anyone else who shoots somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, like her fellow Oakland native Noah Mitchell, Rasheed starts talking not about the young man killed at the Fruitvale BART station, but about seeing her older brother mistreated by a police officer when she was about 6 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was 16 years ago. But today, she says, it seems like yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND   In a dramatic story that has been stoked by amateur YouTube videos, the aftermath of the fatal New Year's Day shooting of a young man by a BART officer unfolded Wednesday on several fronts   with protests, a funeral and an announcement that the officer resigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Wednesday, police responded as hundreds of protesters who started marching from the Fruitvale BART station gathered at the Lake Merritt BART station, overturning trash cans and lighting a trash container on fire. Protesters rammed the trash container against a police car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of police, including BART police, Oakland police and officers from the Housing Authority responded. Officers used tear gas to disperse the crowd. Protesters marched on downtown streets, breaking windows of businesses as officers closed streets to traffic. It was unclear whether there were any arrests or injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,000 people turned out Wednesday at a Hayward church to remember </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III. Cell phone videos apparently show Grant face down being shot by an officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same day, as word spread that officer Johannes Mehserle quit, about 50 protesters met with Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff to demand that his office file charges against Mehserle in the shooting at the Fruitvale BART station. Orloff let the protesters into his office. The group included 10 local pastors, Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson, and Oakland City Councilwoman Desley Brooks, who called Grant's death &quot;an execution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART officials announced Wednesday that Mehserle, 27, had resigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the week, the officer's attorney postponed a meeting that had been scheduled by BART investigators for Tuesday and sought to defer the meeting until next week, according to a news release from BART.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART investigators declined the delay and scheduled Wednesday's meeting, during which Mehserle's attorney and union representative submitted his resignation letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This shooting is a tragic event in every respect for all involved,&quot; BART General Manager Dorothy Dugger said. &quot;We recognize that the family and friends of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are in mourning and we extend our condolences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the funeral services at Palma Ceia Baptist Church, friends described the 22-year-old father as a natural leader of other kids in the church's Royal Ambassadors program, and some thought he would someday become a pastor himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I met Oscar when he was young   6, 7, 8 years old. Oscar always knew so much for a young person,&quot; Deacon Eugene Carter said during the service. &quot;It seemed like he knew as much as some adults. He would ask adult questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life recalled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carter said that from a young age, Grant enjoyed fishing, baseball, chess, dominoes   &quot;whatever you knew how to do, Oscar already knew how to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Church member Donna Smith said Grant &quot;always wanted to lead his family in prayer. Oscar had the loudest voice when he sang in the Sunshine Choir.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant's sister, Chantay Moore, put together a slide show from their life together, saying she didn't realize how many people were in her brother's life until she saw the standing-room-only crowd in the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She described Grant as a &quot;younger brother who could also be an older brother,&quot; and related an incident when he wouldn't allow her out of the house because he thought her clothes were inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was protective,&quot; she said. &quot;If you weren't wearing jeans and a shirt, he didn't like it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Ronald Coleman urged the crowd to &quot;show how believers handle times like this   the world is watching.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged church members to respond with prayer and prudence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can understand that youngsters are upset and angry,'' said Coleman, &quot;but you have to have trust in God.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10:30 a.m.   Police damage estimates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police estimate damages to property from Wednesday night vandalism is $150,000, but the total could go higher as they assess damages. About 25 cars were badly vandalized, including some police cars and city vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the 105 arrested last night were in the area surrounded by 14th and 20 streets, and San Pablo and Broadway, police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to drugs seized from some individuals, two guns were recovered from those arrested. Charges include assault on a police officer, looting, vandalism, rioting and arson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, none of those arrested have yet been charged by the District Attorney, and those arrested on misdemeanors have been cited and released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those arrested for felonies are still being held, but the number hasn't been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police are meeting with the DA today to talk about possibly taking over the investigation into the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III. The investigation is now being conducted by the BART police department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say they have beefed up staffing around the city for the rest of the day, and will respond to any incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We understand it's a very sensitive touchy situation and people need an outlet. In our society that's what's protesting is all about as long as it's peaceful,&quot; Thomason said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a group of individuals who wanted to vandalize, assault police officers and riot. We are not going to stand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for that. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9:10 a.m.   BART Board meeting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BART board of directors is now meeting, attended by about 100 people, with the topic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III's shooting death at the top of the agenda. BART board president Thomas Blalock proposed setting up a committee comprised by four members to address major police incidents, although no action could be taken on the item today because of open meeting laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the first venting of concern in a public meeting of the New Year's Day incident and speakers are now addressing the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland City Councilmember Desley Brooks told the board that she was angered by the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III on New Year's Day, but didn't condone the havoc wrought by Wednesday night's &quot;renegade groups&quot; on the streets of Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a need to focus one's anger,&quot; Brooks said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supervisor Keith Carson asked the board for a public review of policies and procedures that BART police use during arrests, and asked that the coroner's report on Grant's death be made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7 a.m.   Cleanup begins in downtown Oakland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As storekeepers clean up after a night of vandalism and protests in downtown Oakland, police are bracing for more protests this morning after at least 105 people were arrested for a variety of offenses Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said charges for those arrested included assault on a police officer, looting, vandalism and arson. Some of those detained were found to have drugs, which added another count to the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angry about the New Year's Day shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III by a BART police officer, protesters smashed businesses and set fires in downtown Oakland, and confronted Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums on the steps of City Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses downtown are cleaning up this morning, dealing with the aftermath of smashed windows and cars and trash strewn on streets and sidewalks. The damage appears random on some streets, but two blocks of 17th Street between Franklin and Harrison streets were hard hit. Passers-by are shaking their heads as they survey the smashed windows of a tattoo parlor, smoothie shop, cafe, braid studio and fashion design store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leemu Tokpa had swept glass shards into two piles outside her shop, Creative African Braids, on 14th Street so that clients could get in the door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said a group of vandals smashed up her downtown Oakland shop and threw bottles at her while she was holding her 8-month-old baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was working on a client in her business, Creative African Braids on 14th Street, when a group of black males came over and started swearing and smashing her windows. She shouted at them, saying 'Why are you doing this?' Tokpa said. That's when one threw a bottle at her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had to run in the back to hide. They were cussing, saying the f-word and trying to force the door open,&quot; Tokpa said. &quot;It had nothing to do with (the BART shooting).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody feels happy about the guy getting killed, but if they come back to attack me as a black sister I feel very disappointed. I'm struggling here too. And they come and wreck my business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her brother slept in the shop all night, to protect it from further vandalism she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstration began peacefully Wednesday afternoon at the Fruitvale BART station, but the station was eventually closed from 3 to 7 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland's downtown stations at Lake Merritt and Oakland City Center were also temporarily closed because of protests. Windows were smashed at a McDonalds restaurant at 14th and Jackson streets, and Dumpsters were set afire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">T oday, Oakland police are hoping protests will be less violent, but plan to have extra officers on the streets and will be in riot gear. A protest is expected outside BART headquarters, where the agency's board meeting will be held at 9 a.m.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against a cacophony of police choppers overhead, sirens in the distance and jabbering TV reporters, Noah Mitchell sat outside Oakland's Kaiser Center on Thursday at lunchtime, filled with both anger and sorrow for the town he has always called home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love Oakland,&quot; he said, as the streets around him teemed with outrage over the New Year's Day shooting by a BART police officer of an unarmed man. &quot;But it's a troubled place. And I feel like this city won't change for a long, long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside, the BART board of directors sat like a punching bag for a community tirade against perceived police brutality. It was a reaction borne of embers reignited by the incident at the Fruitvale BART station, now churning endlessly through the YouTube portal of eyewitness news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Mitchell and others, either those protesting in the streets or supporters cheering them on from their living rooms, the true import of this moment transcends a tragic incident on a train-station platform. Mitchell is barely in his 20s, born and raised in an epicenter of America's racial struggles, part African-American, and just black enough to know what it feels like to really love-hate Oakland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I once got pulled through the window of my car by an Oakland police officer,&quot; he said in a soft, meek voice. &quot;Ever since, every time I see a police officer, I'm scared it'll happen again. But it's more than that. It's the everyday rudeness, like when I ask for directions, they joke it off, laugh at me, and walk on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lingering protests and scattered nighttime violence downtown this week surprised a lot of people, as if the bold response seemed out of sync with the shooting. But even though the victim was from Hayward, and the incident took place on BART property and involved BART police, the story line for many has moved on   to Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's an accident of geography that the riots took place here and that the focus is now on Oakland,&quot; said Steven Lavoie, longtime city observer and librarian at the Oakland History Room at the main library. &quot;The problems between law enforcement and minority communities are not unique to Oakland. But because of our large minority population, these issues come to a head here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oakland,&quot; he said, &quot;is the venue for much larger social problems. And I don't think the people of the privileged class, of which I'm probably a member, understand the impact of injustice in this community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of justice came up again and again at the BART board meeting. Looking stunned by the barrage of criticism, the mostly white-male board found itself the lightning rod for a homegrown bitterness 60 years in the making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope you hear what the community is saying to you,&quot; said Ken Nelson, a local leader of the NAACP, one of several speakers calling for a state investigation into the shooting, and imploring the board to improve officer training. &quot;You can't be quiet anymore. This must be corrected immediately, or we'll continue to have flare-ups. Your silence means approval. Please do not continue to remain silent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson was asking the board to speak out, but he could have been addressing each of the 400,000 people who call &quot;Oaktown&quot; home. Oakland is and always has been a bifurcated place, with wealthier and whiter residents in the hills, poorer people of color in the flatlands, and each group able to spend entire lifetimes largely confined to one area or the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a crowd of people waited outside the front doors, locked by security officers because the conference room was already packed, local businessman Frank Tucker implored the BART board to seize the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, you've got people down there trying to break down the doors to speak to you today, and nothing's being done to let them inside,&quot; said Tucker, a board member of the city's African-American Chamber of Commerce. &quot;This is a metaphor of what's been happening on a larger scale in Oakland for years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historian Lavoie said you can trace the history of troubled relations between Oakland minorities and police to the 1950s, when the lure of post-World War II jobs brought African-Americans from the South, as well as white Southerners, many of whom would put on uniform and badge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tension that resulted had a lot to do with who was hired, because a lot of the people from the South brought attitudes with them,&quot; he said. &quot;Blacks, but also whites not willing to be as tolerant as Oakland historically had been.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lavoie says relations between police and minorities have dramatically improved since the 1960s, when the Black Panthers formed to patrol the streets, ostensibly to police the police. Despite this week's flare of street violence, &quot;what you should look at is how police responded Wednesday night, versus how they went after peace marchers in the '60s. There's a huge difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And BART spokesman Linton Johnson, an African-American who said his own aunt had been roughed up by a Los Angeles cop years ago, defended the agency's police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They care about the public and they've done a wonderful job keeping BART safe for everyone,&quot; he said. &quot;There have been only five officer-involved shootings resulting in injury or death in BART's 36 years. The officers do a hell of a job protecting the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet many still see police as intimidating. Oakland native and college student Tahirah Rasheed waved a &quot;Stop police brutality&quot; placard outside the board meeting, saying &quot;the police are modern-day slave patrollers.&quot; She's seen the homemade videos of the shooting, which apparently show officer Johannes Mehserle firing his weapon at 22-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III as he lay facedown on the platform. She says she doesn't need to see anything else. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those videos, which have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, are a study in chaos, as the shooting unfolds in front of dozens of train passengers returning home after New Year's Eve celebrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to reports of young men fighting on a train, BART police arrived shortly after midnight, taking Grant and several others off the train for questioning. The images show Grant pushed onto his stomach shortly before Mehserle fired his gun at Grant's back. The bullet ricocheted off the pavement and pierced his lung.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fueled by the footage, a debate has raged over whether the officer knowingly shot Grant, as the victim's family alleges, or may have tragically mistaken his handgun for a stun gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those arguments now seem lost on Rasheed and others who see the incident as part of something much bigger, no matter how much some people feel police relations with Oakland's minorities may have improved over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This shooting,'' said Rasheed, &quot;is the culmination of decades of'' bad relations between police and citizens. &quot;That BART officer should be arrested and in jail, just like anyone else who shoots somebody.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, like her fellow Oakland native Noah Mitchell, Rasheed starts talking not about the young man killed at the Fruitvale BART station, but about seeing her older brother mistreated by a police officer when she was about 6 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was 16 years ago. But today, she says, it seems like yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As family and friends of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III pleaded for peace Thursday afternoon, broken glass was being cleaned up from the previous night's disturbances in downtown Oakland, burned cars were towed away, and some business owners   fearing a repeat of the violence   made plans for nightfall, closing early and sending employees home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am begging the citizens to not use violent tactics anymore,&quot; said Grant's mother, an emotional Wanda Johnson, who appeared with about 30 of Grant's relatives and friends at a news conference called by attorney John Burris at his East Oakland office building. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris is representing Grant's mother and 4-year-old daughter in a $25 million lawsuit filed against BART in the officer-involved shooting of Grant, 22, in the early hours of New Year's Day after a scuffle at the Fruitvale BART station. BART police officer Johannes Mehserle, who fired the fatal shot, has resigned from the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know it's a very frustrating time,&quot; Johnson said, referring to the police investigation into the shooting. &quot;But Oscar would not want to see the violence and the fires. We believe this situation is going to come to a close and justice will be served. I'm asking you please, please, stop it and let justice prevail. Please stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Ron Dellums and other city leaders also urged people to remain peaceful in their protests. At an afternoon news conference, officials also said the Oakland Police Department will conduct an investigation of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will review what has been done and we will develop our own witnesses as well,&quot; said Oakland police Chief Wayne Tucker. &quot;That's what's intended now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police will assist the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, which previously had been working exclusively with BART police in trying to determine whether criminal charges should be filed against the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff said he expected a case to be &quot;totally prepared&quot; in about two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know people are unhappy with that,&quot; he said. &quot;I know there's a lot of emotion. I have to sit back and look at this as objectively as I can with all the facts that are available and make the decision   not only whether or not he should be charged, but what offense he should he charged with &quot;... and it's not as simple as most people think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police estimate at least $150,000 in damage resulted from the scattered violence that broke out late Wednesday night after an originally peaceful protest about Grant's killing moved from the Fruitvale BART station to the downtown area. Splinter groups   many not related to the original protest   fanned out, breaking store windows, setting fire to at least five cars, including an Oakland police patrol car, and smashing windshields of parked cars. More than 100 people were arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Thursday, an emotional BART district board apologized for the shooting and vowed to create a new board committee to look into police issues and consider setting up a civilian police review board for the transit agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what the community needs to hear is that we apologize to his family,&quot; Bob Franklin, a BART board member from Oakland, said after hearing 60 public speakers over six hours denounce the shooting. &quot;As a board member, I apologize.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Oakland businesses shut down early Thursday. Clorox closed its offices on Broadway at 13th Street and sent workers home at 2 p.m., Clorox spokesman Dan Staublin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a precautionary step, given what happened Wednesday night,&quot; he said. &quot;We take the safety of our employees very seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND   The BART police officer under investigation for the fatal New Year's Day shooting of an unarmed man quit his job Wednesday rather than speak with investigators, an official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former officer Johannes Mehserle, 27, has given no comment to BART investigators since the incident in which cell phone videos appeared to capture Mehserle shooting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III as Grant lay facedown on the ground at the Fruitvale station, BART spokesman Linton Johnson said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a meeting scheduled for him to talk, and his attorney and a union rep came in his place and dropped off a letter of resignation instead,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;It's interesting, because he was supposed to be talking for the administrative part of our investigation, which is privileged information and couldn't have been used in any criminal investigation anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While BART officials said they've been trying to get Mehserle to talk ever since the shooting, Mehserle's attorney said he hadn't received any requests for an interview from Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff's office as of Wednesday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In general, a prosecutor would contact the attorney of anyone under investigation for a crime,&quot; said Christopher Miller, Mehserle's Sacramento-based union attorney. &quot;So that would have come to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orloff declined Wednesday to discuss any details of his office's investigation with the media, citing a standing policy his office has to allow police departments to act as the main public face of any officer-involved shooting investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've confirmed the investigation, and that's about as much as we'll say,&quot; Orloff said. &quot;The normal thing in a situation like this is to interview anyone who can shed light on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle's resignation takes away BART's ability to leverage a statement out of him, since he can no longer be fired for remaining silent, Orloff said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orloff met with a group of about 50 clergy and community members in his office, after they held a rally outside the courthouse and packed the lobby outside his office with wall-to-wall demonstrators demanding he meet with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the demonstrators was Oakland Councilmember Desley Brooks (Eastmont-Seminary), who called the shooting an &quot;execution&quot; and demanded an explanation of the behavior of the other officers present during the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brooks and the clergy spoke with a crowd of about 100 people outside the courthouse just after 9 a.m. and said they'd been denied a meeting with Orloff and demanded swift justice for Grant's killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What shall we tell our sons?&quot; said the Rev. Dr. J. Alfred Smith Sr. of Alan Temple Baptist Church. &quot;Shall we tell them to fear the law? Is the law their enemy? If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not safe, then I am not safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Christopher Muhammad of the Nation of Islam said Mehserle should be arrested immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is left to investigate? The whole world has seen this,&quot; Muhammad said, referring to widespread Internet videos taken from witnesses' cell phones. &quot;We can discuss his mindset later. But right now he should be detained and held on criminal charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a demonstration in protest of the shooting Wednesday afternoon at the Fruitvale station, Grant's younger sister, Audrena Gilbert, said Mehserle has not talked to the bereaved family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want him to start. I want him to apologize for what he did,&quot; said Gilbert, 19, of Oakland. &quot;I want him to tell the truth, why he shot him, what he shot him for. That's all I want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The afternoon protest, which had a microphone open for anyone to speak but was led by speakers for the Coalition Against Police Executions, drew a crowd of 500 people, police estimated. The station was temporarily shut down, and trains let passengers off at stations on either side of the stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not enough the officer resigned today,&quot; said Sean Dugar, president of the California National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Youth and College Division. &quot;We demand he be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. &quot;... We shut down one BART station this afternoon. Let's do another one next week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speakers at both the morning and afternoon protests led the crowd in a call-and-return chant, shouting, &quot;I am </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several clergymen at the morning protest, speakers at the Fruitvale station protest and Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums all expressed an understanding for the community's anger but urged demonstrators to refrain from violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we handle ourselves in this moment, so shall our children,&quot; Dellums said. &quot;I think that in a community that's trying to get its hands around violence, that it's important for us to maintain the integrity of a peaceful community going forward, even in this moment of great anger, great loss and great tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this appeal, protesters shouted angrily at a representative from Dellums' office sent to the Fruitvale station, and when the crowd later moved toward Lake Merritt, it prompted the police shutdown of the BART station there, lighting a Dumpster's content on fire and ramming it into a police car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dellums said the city of Oakland and its Police Department should not become involved in the shooting investigation at this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You deal with the appropriate agencies on the ground, and I think right now that's Bay Area Rapid Transit and that's the district attorney's office,&quot; he said. &quot;At this point, I view my role as simply trying to articulate the pain and the sorrow and even the anger that people feel at the loss of human life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dave Rose, a retired Placer County sheriff's lieutenant who's now an expert witness on police use of force and the co-author of &quot;Police Use-of-Force Case Law,&quot; said every bit of Mehserle's training and all circumstances of the situation on the BART platform that night must be taken into account. All the videos should be professionally enhanced and then reviewed frame by frame for every detail, every twitch, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on Mehserle's experience and how officers react physiologically in high-stress situations, Rose said, it could well have been nothing more than a tragic, noncriminal accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But UC Berkeley Boalt Hall Law School professor Franklin Zimring, a criminal justice expert, said &quot;absolutely conclusive&quot; videos of the shooting have convinced him there's no possible justification for Mehserle's actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Normally, what you get in a police deadly force interaction is a 'he said, she said' in which there's at least an accusation like, 'There was a flash of metal as he reached toward his pocket,'&quot;[0/00]&quot; Zimring said. &quot;But this guy was already down on the ground. &quot;... He's not in a position to be threatening anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Use of deadly force is considered &quot;in terms of a threat to the physical safety of the officer or somebody else, and there's none there in this case,&quot; he added. &quot;So it's accident versus intention, but justification is off the table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Mehserle meant to draw his Taser but accidentally drew his firearm, or whether he meant to draw his sidearm but didn't mean to fire it, it looks like involuntary manslaughter, Zimring said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My money is on that second horse: I think it was an accident, but I don't think the drawing of the gun was an accident,&quot; he said, noting it probably wouldn't have been appropriate to draw the Taser but &quot;under no circumstance I could imagine&quot; should Mehserle have drawn his firearm given what's seen on the videos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimring said accidental shootings by officers are rarely charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They don't even have to meet criminal juries most of the time, but most of the time there's a plausible officer vulnerability,&quot; he said. &quot;That's what juries can identify with, and that's what's missing in action here. If I were a U.S. or prosecuting attorney, I would not be afraid of taking a criminal case here, certainly for involuntary manslaughter, before an Alameda County jury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of a statement from Mehserle, the proper thing to do is to charge the case based on the evidence at hand and then hear his side of the story later, Zimring said: &quot;Not giving a statement in this context may be motivated by an unwillingness to incriminate oneself, but it also deprives the officer of an opportunity to allege that the conduct was unintended.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HAYWARD   A steady stream of mourners passed by the wreath-flanked casket of Oscar Juliuss Grant III, and by the time his funeral service began Wednesday morning, an overcapacity crowd of about 1,000 people had packed into South Hayward's Palma Ceia Baptist Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As family members took their seats   more than 100 of Grant's relatives attended   one woman became overcome with grief and allowed herself to be escorted outside. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church's Rev. Ronald Coleman changed the tone with music, singing &quot;I don't know what you came to do, but I came to pray today&quot; to a crowd that increasingly clapped along.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coleman urged the crowd to &quot;show the world how we believers handle stuff like this, and lift up this family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So set the mood for most of the services, which squarely focused on the life of 22-year-old Grant, and not on his violent shooting death on the Fruitvale BART platform, early Jan. 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant had long been a member of the church on Ruus Road, and pastors spoke warmly about the man whom they'd known since he was a young boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I met Oscar when he was young   6, 7, 8 years old,&quot; Deacon Eugene Carter said during the service. Oscar always knew so much for a young person. It seemed like he knew as much as some adults. .&quot;[#x201a].&quot;[#x201a]. He would ask adult questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant had shown leadership skills as part of the church's Royal Ambassadors program, Carter said, which made the deacon think that one day the boy would become a pastor himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a young age, Grant enjoyed fishing, baseball, chess and dominoes, Carter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever you knew how to do, Oscar already knew how to do it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Little Oscar was the apple of God's eyes,&quot; said church member Donna Smith, who added that she saw herself as a &quot;second mother&quot; to Grant. &quot;When it was time to pray, he always wanted to lead his family in prayer. Oscar had the loudest voice when he sang in the (church's) Sunshine Choir.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His closest friends mourned the loss of someone they'd known all their lives as a loyal ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We grew closer and closer over the years, and no matter what, Oscar would always be there for you,&quot; said Kris Raffety, who said he'd known Grant for 17 years. &quot;He was always so good to his friends. I think of his smile, his laugh, his energy and the unconditional love he brought to each of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant's sister, Chantay Moore, put together a slideshow of photos of Grant through the years, and said she didn't realize how many people were in her brother's life until she saw the standing-room-only crowd in the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She described Grant as a &quot;younger brother who could also be an older brother,&quot; and related an incident when he wouldn't allow her out of the house because he thought her clothes were inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was protective,&quot; she said. &quot;If you weren't wearing jeans and a shirt, he didn't like it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moore said Grant was a loving father to his 4-year-old daughter, Tatiana. Other relatives recalled how proud he was when his daughter was born, and that he'd &quot;pulled up in a golden-brown scraper car, with huge 'It's a Girl' wreaths on each side&quot; that he kept around until they disintegrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coleman ended the services by urging church members to respond to Grant's death with &quot;prayer and prudence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can understand that youngsters are upset and angry, but you have to have trust in God,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not your battle, this is not (Grant's mother's) battle. This is the Lord's battle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant was buried later in the day in Lone Tree Cemetery in the Hayward hills.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND   Mayor Ron Dellums stood before a fuming crowd on the steps of City Hall on Wednesday night trying to restore calm after angry protesters rampaged through the streets of downtown Oakland, creating a surreal near-riot that lasted several hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Number one, let's deal with each other with respect,&quot; Dellums told the crowd over a bullhorn, referring to the Jan. 1 shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III by former BART police Officer Johannes Mehserle   captured on cell phone and digital camera videos and replayed on national television stations. &quot;I sense your anger, I sense your pain and your frustration.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Oakland has no direct jurisdiction over the incident, Dellums pledged that the city would investigate Grant's shooting &quot;like any other homicide.&quot; Unappeased, the crowd of about 50 protesters erupted in jeers and boos at the mayor's words as he retreated into City Hall, demanding that Mehserle be brought to justice for the unarmed 22-year-old father's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a dozen of the protesters then began smashing windows of nearby businesses and cars, including several city of Oakland vehicles parked near 17th Street and on San Pablo Avenue, just north of Frank H. Ogawa Plaza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, police fired what appeared to be tear gas for the second time after a relatively peaceful demonstration began at the Fruitvale BART Station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time a marching crowd left the Fruitvale station and reached the Lake Merritt BART station, the protest had turned violent. Cars were burned, windows of cars and downtown businesses were smashed, Dumpsters were overturned, tear gas was fired, and at least 13 people were arrested. Protesters broke out windows and dented an Oakland Police Department car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters also threw bottles in the direction of officers, and as many as 200 police, including Oakland's Tactical Operations Team, were called to the scene. BART police and officers from the Housing Authority were sent in for backup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Epstein, assistant editor of the Oakland Post, who was finishing an article about Grant's death, watched from the 12th story of his office at 14th and Franklin streets as his 2002 Honda CR-V disintegrated in a roar of flames as the police continued to push protesters down 14th Street from the intersection with Broadway, smashing store windows and setting trash cans on fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters were outraged that the officer involved had not been interviewed, he said, adding that he shared their anger. It was clear from the videotape that Grant was lying facedown and he hadn't been accused of a crime, Epstein added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry my car was burned but the issue is very upsetting,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the standoff escalated, protesters chanted &quot;murder, murder, murder&quot; and were forced by heavily armed police toward Madison and 15th streets. It was at that time protesters set ablaze another car and smashed shop windows, including Creative African Braids, Oakland Yoon's Pharmacy and the McDonald's on 14th and Madison streets. Damage estimates were impossible to gather late Wednesday, as was the extent of the damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART spokesman Linton Johnson said three stations got shut down by protesters Wednesday   12th Street, Fruitvale and Lake Merritt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said no one was seriously hurt at those stations and no BART property was damaged. &quot;There will be beefed-up security and BART police on standby&quot; at the BART board of directors meeting at 9 a.m. this morning, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters were &quot;calling attention to something that is a systematic problem, which won't go away with an apology,&quot; said a 29-year-old who identified himself only as B. Rex. He was arrested and taken by police in a squad car soon after.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND   The BART police officer under investigation for the fatal New Year's Day shooting of an unarmed man quit his job Wednesday rather than speak with investigators, an official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former officer Johannes Mehserle, 27, has given no comment to BART investigators since the incident in which cell phone videos appeared to capture Mehserle shooting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III as Grant lay facedown on the ground at the Fruitvale station, BART spokesman Linton Johnson said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a meeting scheduled for him to talk, and his attorney and a union rep came in his place and dropped off a letter of resignation instead,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;It's interesting, because he was supposed to be talking for the administrative part of our investigation, which is privileged information and couldn't have been used in any criminal investigation anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While BART officials said they've been trying to get Mehserle to talk ever since the shooting, Mehserle's attorney said he hadn't received any requests for an interview from Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff's office as of Wednesday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In general, a prosecutor would contact the attorney of anyone under investigation for a crime,&quot; said Christopher Miller, Mehserle's Sacramento-based union attorney. &quot;So that would have come to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orloff declined Wednesday to discuss any details of his office's investigation with the media, citing a standing policy his office has to allow police departments to act as the main public face of any officer-involved shooting investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've confirmed the investigation, and that's about as much as we'll say,&quot; Orloff said. &quot;The normal thing in a situation like this is to interview anyone who can shed light on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle's resignation takes away BART's ability to leverage a statement out of him, since he can no longer be fired for remaining silent, Orloff said. Orloff met with a group of about 50 clergy and community members in his office, after they held a rally outside the Oakland courthouse and packed the lobby outside his office with wall-to-wall demonstrators demanding he meet with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the demonstrators was Oakland Councilmember Desley Brooks (Eastmont-Seminary), who called the shooting an &quot;execution&quot; and demanded an explanation of the behavior of the other officers present during the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brooks and the clergy spoke with a crowd of about 100 people outside the courthouse just after 9 a.m. and said they'd been denied a meeting with Orloff and demanded swift justice for Grant's killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What shall we tell our sons?&quot; said the Rev. Dr. J. Alfred Smith Sr. of Alan Temple Baptist Church. &quot;Shall we tell them to fear the law? Is the law their enemy? If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not safe, then I am not safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Christopher Muhammad of the Nation of Islam said Mehserle should be arrested immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is left to investigate? The whole world has seen this,&quot; Muhammad said, referring to widespread Internet videos taken from witnesses' cell phones. &quot;We can discuss his mindset later. But right now he should be detained and held on criminal charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a demonstration in protest of the shooting Wednesday afternoon at the Fruitvale station, Grant's younger sister, Audrena Gilbert, said Mehserle has not talked to the bereaved family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want him to start. I want him to apologize for what he did,&quot; said Gilbert, 19, of Oakland. &quot;I want him to tell the truth, why he shot him, what he shot him for. That's all I want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The afternoon protest, which had a microphone open for anyone to speak but was led by speakers for the Coalition Against Police Executions, drew a crowd of 500 people, police estimated. The station was temporarily shut down, and trains let passengers off at stations on either side of the stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not enough the officer resigned today,&quot; said Sean Dugar, president of the California National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Youth and College Division. &quot;We demand he be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. &quot;... We shut down one BART station this afternoon. Let's do another one next week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speakers at both the morning and afternoon protests led the crowd in a call-and-return chant, shouting, &quot;I am </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several clergymen at the morning protest, speakers at the Fruitvale station protest and Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums all expressed an understanding for the community's anger but urged demonstrators to refrain from violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we handle ourselves in this moment, so shall our children,&quot; Dellums said. &quot;I think that in a community that's trying to get its hands around violence, that it's important for us to maintain the integrity of a peaceful community going forward, even in this moment of great anger, great loss and great tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this appeal, protesters shouted angrily at a representative from Dellums' office sent to the Fruitvale station, and when the crowd later moved toward Lake Merritt, it prompted the police shutdown of the BART station there Members of the crowd lit a Dumpster's contents on fire and rammed the container into a police car. Dellums said the city of Oakland and its Police Department should not become involved in the shooting investigation at this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You deal with the appropriate agencies on the ground, and I think right now that's Bay Area Rapid Transit and that's the district attorney's office,&quot; he said. &quot;At this point, I view my role as simply trying to articulate the pain and the sorrow and even the anger that people feel at the loss of human life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dave Rose, a retired Placer County sheriff's lieutenant who's now an expert witness on police use of force and the co-author of &quot;Police Use-of-Force Case Law,&quot; said every bit of Mehserle's training and all circumstances of the situation on the BART platform that night must be taken into account. All the videos should be professionally enhanced and then reviewed frame by frame for every detail, every twitch, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on Mehserle's experience and how officers react physiologically in high-stress situations, Rose said, it could well have been nothing more than a tragic, noncriminal accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But UC Berkeley Boalt Hall Law School professor Franklin Zimring, a criminal justice expert, said &quot;absolutely conclusive&quot; videos of the shooting have convinced him there's no possible justification for Mehserle's actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Normally, what you get in a police deadly force interaction is a 'he said, she said' in which there's at least an accusation like, 'There was a flash of metal as he reached toward his pocket,'&quot;[0/00]&quot; Zimring said. &quot;But this guy was already down on the ground. &quot;... He's not in a position to be threatening anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Use of deadly force is considered &quot;in terms of a threat to the physical safety of the officer or somebody else, and there's none there in this case,&quot; he added. &quot;So it's accident versus intention, but justification is off the table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Mehserle meant to draw his Taser but accidentally drew his firearm, or whether he meant to draw his sidearm but didn't mean to fire it, it looks like involuntary manslaughter, Zimring said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My money is on that second horse: I think it was an accident, but I don't think the drawing of the gun was an accident,&quot; he said, noting it probably wouldn't have been appropriate to draw the Taser but &quot;under no circumstance I could imagine&quot; should Mehserle have drawn his firearm given what's seen on the videos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimring said accidental shootings by officers are rarely charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They don't even have to meet criminal juries most of the time, but most of the time there's a plausible officer vulnerability,&quot; he said. &quot;That's what juries can identify with, and that's what's missing in action here. If I were a U.S. or prosecuting attorney, I would not be afraid of taking a criminal case here, certainly for involuntary manslaughter, before an Alameda County jury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of a statement from Mehserle, the proper thing to do is to charge the case based on the evidence at hand and then hear his side of the story later, Zimring said: &quot;Not giving a statement in this context may be motivated by an unwillingness to incriminate oneself, but it also deprives the officer of an opportunity to allege that the conduct was unintended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there isn't a criminal investigation in this case, I think it will be an enduring scandal,&quot; he said, &quot;and therefore I think that you're going to see an investigation, and you're going to see it in a matter of a very few days.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scheduled to meet with BART police investigators today, the BART Police officer involved in the tragic shooting New Year's Day at Fruitvale Station submitted his resignation effective immediately. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the officer's attorney postponed a meeting that had been scheduled by BART investigators for Tuesday and sought to defer the meeting until next week. BART investigators declined the delay and scheduled a meeting with the officer for this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this morning's scheduled meeting, the officer's attorney and his union representative submitted his resignation letter. The officer was not present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART investigators have urged the officer to meet and cooperate with the transit agency's investigation into the fatal shooting. BART Police investigators have notified the Alameda County District Attorney's Office of the resignation and this development.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a dramatic story that has been stoked by amateur YouTube videos, the aftermath of the fatal New Year's Day shooting of a young man by a BART police officer accelerated Wednesday night as hundreds of protesters rampaged through the streets of downtown Oakland, creating a near-riot that lasted for several hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police are bracing for more protests this morning after at least 105 people were arrested for a variety of offenses Wednesday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said charges for those arrested included assault on a police officer, looting, vandalism and arson. Some of those detained were found to have drugs, which added another count to the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angry about the New Year's Day shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III by a BART police officer, protesters smashed businesses and set fires in downtown Oakland, and confronted Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums on the steps of City Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Oakland police are hoping protests will be less violent, but plan to have extra officers on the streets and will be in riot gear. A protest is expected outside BART headquarters, where the agency's board meeting will be held at 9 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses downtown are cleaning up this morning, dealing with the aftermath of smashed windows and cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leemu Tokpa had swept glass shards into two piles outside her shop, Creative African Braids, on 14th Street so that clients could get in the door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said a group of vandals smashed up her downtown Oakland shop and threw bottles at her while she was holding her 8-month-old baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was working on a client in her business when a group of black males came over and started swearing and smashing her windows. She shouted at them, saying 'Why are you doing this?' Tokpa said. That's when one threw a bottle at her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had to run in the back to hide. They were cussing, saying the f-word and trying to force the door open,&quot; Tokpa said. &quot;It had nothing to do with (the BART shooting).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody feels happy about the guy getting killed, but if they come back to attack me as a black sister I feel very disappointed. I'm struggling here too. And they come and wreck my business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her brother slept in the shop all night, to protect it from further vandalism she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday, family and friends attended a funeral for Grant, 22, who was shot to death by former BART police officer Johannes Mehserle, The shooting was caught on cell phone and digital camera videos and replayed on national television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Wednesday, BART announced that Mehserle had resigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beginning around 5 p.m., police responded to scattered disturbances as hundreds of protesters marched from the Fruitvale BART station to City Hall, overturning trash cans, setting cars and trash containers on fire and taunting police trying to control them. At one point, protesters rammed a trash container against a police car, bashing in the front and back windows and denting the passenger side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For several hours, scores of police officers from Oakland, BART and the Housing Authority skirmished with as many as 200 demonstrators who had broken away from the Fruitvale demonstration and who appeared to be doing most of the vandalism. Officers used tear gas to disperse protesters who moved about downtown streets, breaking the windows of some businesses and setting multiple cars on fire and forcing police to shut down a number of streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a 9:30 p.m. news conference, police said they had arrested 14 adults and one juvenile, with at least one person charged with assaulting a police officer. Officials were bracing for another protest expected this morning when the BART board meets at its headquarters near Lake Merritt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Wednesday, more than 1,000 people turned out at a Hayward church to remember Grant, the 22-year-old father one worshipper called &quot;the apple of God's eyes.&quot; Cell phone videos apparently show Grant lying in a passive pose, then being shot by an officer standing over him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same day, as word spread that Mehserle had quit the force, about 50 protesters met with Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff to demand that his office file charges against Mehserle. BART officials announced Wednesday that Mehserle, 27, had resigned. Earlier in the week, the officer's attorney postponed a meeting that had been scheduled by BART investigators for Tuesday and sought to defer the meeting until next week, according to a news release from BART.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART investigators declined the delay and scheduled Wednesday's meeting, during which Mehserle's attorney and union representative submitted his resignation letter. The officer was not present, according to the release from BART.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART officials had urged Mehserle to meet and cooperate with the transit agency's investigation into the fatal shooting, which has been playing out online in disturbing videos and eyewitness accounts of the melee that led to the incident. Officers were called to the station after a report that a fight had broken out on a train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This shooting is a tragic event in every respect for all involved,&quot; BART General Manager Dorothy Dugger said. &quot;We recognize that the family and friends of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are in mourning, and we extend our condolences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the funeral services at Palma Ceia Baptist Church, friends described the young father as a natural leader of other kids in the church's Royal Ambassadors program, and some thought he would someday become a pastor himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I met Oscar when he was young   6, 7, 8 years old. Oscar always knew so much for a young person,&quot; Deacon Eugene Carter said during the service. &quot;It seemed like he knew as much as some adults. &quot;... He would ask adult questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carter said that from a young age, Grant enjoyed fishing, baseball, chess, dominoes   &quot;whatever you knew how to do, Oscar already knew how to do it.&quot; Church member Donna Smith said Grant &quot;always wanted to lead his family in prayer. Oscar had the loudest voice when he sang in the Sunshine Choir.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Ronald Coleman urged the crowd to &quot;show how believers handle times like this   the world is watching.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged church members to respond with prayer and prudence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can understand that youngsters are upset and angry,'' said Coleman, &quot;but you have to have trust in God.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IF BART police have an explanation for the fatal shooting of a 22-year-old Hayward man early New Year's Day, they need to start talking. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amateur video of the incident seems to show an execution-style shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III by an officer whom police refuse to identify, except to tell us that he has two years' experience on the job. The video shows Grant being shot in the back while lying face down on the Fruitvale station platform. It is a sickening scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant's family has already retained prominent civil rights attorney John Burris, who has talked to witnesses and reviewed three videos taken by onlookers. &quot;What the witnesses said happened and what is on the videotapes are very much the same,&quot; Burris told reporters. &quot;From that you get a real clear picture of what happened. From that you can easily determine that Mr. Grant was killed by this officer under circumstances that were woefully unjustified. It is without a doubt the most unconscionable shooting I have seen ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have a similar reaction to the video. We want to keep an open mind. Perhaps the gun went off accidentally. Perhaps, as has been suggested, the officer mistakenly thought in the heat of the moment that he was firing a Taser stun gun. But now, five days after the incident, the police department's stonewalling is troubling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more disturbing, it seems that, as of Monday, police had not yet interviewed the officer who fired the fatal shot. It would seem that police interested in getting the complete story would have talked to the man by now who pulled the trigger   to get his fresh recollection of the incident before he could concoct another explanation. It makes us wonder whether BART police want the unvarnished truth or would rather protect one of their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All we know is that there was a fight on a BART train within the first couple of hours of the new year. Officers were called to the station and several people, including Grant, were detained on the platform. We don't know if Grant was involved with the fight. We don't know how many witnesses there were on the train, but some took video of the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears that some were handcuffed. But Burris says Grant was not: &quot;Mr. Grant, at the time he was shot and killed, was in fact lying on his stomach with his back to two officers with one officer kneeling down at his neck and head area with a knee there and the other officer straddling over him. &quot;... (Grant) did not have a weapon, he was not kicking. &quot;... The officer for reasons that are the most shocking to me pulled out his weapon and within moments fired it directly into the back of Mr. Grant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris plans to ask prosecutors to consider filing criminal charges against the officer. We are glad that Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff is conducting a parallel investigation. We hope it is rigorous. Indeed, we all want to know if this was an accidental shooting or a coldblooded murder.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris plans to ask prosecutors to consider filing criminal charges against the officer. We are glad that Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff is conducting a parallel investigation. We hope it is rigorous. Indeed, we all want to know if this was an accidental shooting or a coldblooded murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KTVU Channel 2 introduced the first video it obtained of the New Year's Day shooting at the Fruitvale BART station by saying that it was so disturbing, some viewers might choose to turn away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hype was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the video taken on a passenger's cell phone isn't of superior quality, it appears to show a shocking scene: A BART police officer shooting a 22-year-old man named </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III in the back while other officers hold him down. After the fatal shot is fired, all of the officers, including the shooter, look befuddled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet as jarring as the video is   as are the others making the rounds on the Internet   it is not, as some are claiming, proof that the BART officer who fired his weapon committed murder &quot;in cold blood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should feel outrage over the police killing of a young, unarmed man on a train platform. We, the community, the media, must continue to demand answers from BART as well as the Alameda County district attorney's office, which is investigating the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an emotional, traumatic thing whenever a young man is killed by police. Especially when, from what we appear to see in the video, Grant did not seem to pose a threat that warranted a police officer to use deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must keep up the pressure on BART and the district attorney until we get answers to what happened on that darkened platform. Another protest is scheduled for 3 p.m. today at the Fruitvale BART station, and members of the community should come out and continue their demands for justice to be served.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet at the same time, we must all be careful to resist the temptation to try this case in the media or on the Internet based on cell phone videos that tell only part of a story in a snapshot in time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is too much we don't know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't know what exact information BART police received that made them pull Grant and several other men off the train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't know if Grant was one of the men involved in whatever the initial commotion was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't know what conversation took place between Grant and the officers nor why they decided to restrain him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't know what was going through those officers' minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't know whether the officer reached for his Taser, as some reports have suggested, but may have accidentally drawn his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know nothing beyond the videos that have been played and replayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we do know is that 2009 has gotten off to a horrific start for two families. Grant will not see his 4-year-old daughter grow up. His family members must cope with the haunting knowledge that in his final moments, their loved one was forced down on a cold, concrete BART platform and shot in the back. The life of another young man, the BART officer who fired the fatal shot, will never be the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is identified as Johannes Mehserle in some media reports   though BART officials have refused to publicly name him. Mehserle just turned 27 on Monday. His first child was born early this week. It should have been a time of great joy. Instead, in the blink of an eye, Mehserle's life has turned into a nightmare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters are calling him a murderer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something clearly went horribly wrong on that BART platform. Even if, in the best case scenario, it was an accident, that offers no solace to Grant's family. Either way, his young life has been cut terribly, senselessly short. Instead of celebrating the blessings of a New Year, his family is making funeral arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant's family members have hired civil rights attorney John Burris. Burris is filing a $25 million lawsuit alleging that the BART officer violated Grant's civil rights and wrongfully caused his death. The tragedy is: No amount of money, no matter how much the amount, will bring back Grant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND   The BART police officer who shot and killed an unarmed man early New Year's Day in Oakland could have done it intentionally or by dire mistake, and a key factor is whether the officer was armed with a Taser that day, an attorney representing the dead man's family said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer, identified as Johannes Mehserle in a wrongful death claim, is seen on several recently released cell phone videos of the Fruitvale station incident standing over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III, at which point the officer appears to draw his gun from its holster on his right hip and point it at Grant, who is facedown on the station floor. Within moments a gunshot is heard and, in a video released Monday night, the officer looks up and down twice, then briefly touches his face with his hand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many online viewers of the video have posted comments speculating the officer may have thought he was reaching for a Taser when he grabbed his gun, suggesting he meant only to stun Grant, a 22-year-old Hayward man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the case I'm involved in, it doesn't matter if he was reaching for a Taser or not,&quot; said civil rights attorney John Burris, who is representing Grant's family in a $25 million wrongful death claim filed Tuesday against BART and Mehserle. &quot;At the end of the day, it's what he did that counts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris has publicly asked Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff to consider filing criminal charges against Mehserle, however, and said the Taser question could have bearing on that issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he thought he was reaching for a Taser and pulled a gun, that's negligent. That would be involuntary manslaughter, a negligent homicide,&quot; Burris said. &quot;If he didn't have any Taser on him ... that's an intentional killing: second-degree murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris and BART police Chief Gary Gee have said the facts remain unclear whether Mehserle had been carrying a Taser that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART police began training to use Tasers about three months ago, BART spokesman Linton Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department does not have enough of the stun guns to equip every officer with one, Gee said. When officers do carry Tasers, he added, they are kept on a separate part of their belts from their service pistols.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They keep those Tasers on the opposite side of their gun hand, or in the middle, pointed the opposite direction so you have to turn your hand to get it,&quot; Burris said. &quot;No movement (on the videos) suggests (the officer) was reaching for anything other than the location where the gun was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris said he has not requested any information from BART police but plans to submit a request in the next day or two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standard-issue pistols for BART police are Sig-Sauer .40-caliber semi-automatic pistols, Gee said, and the department uses the X26 model Taser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A loaded Sig-Sauer weighs nearly three times as much as the X26 Taser and is taller by about 2 inches, according to specifications on a gun dealer and official Taser Web sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When five officers responded to reports of a fight on a BART train by stopping the train at the Fruitvale station about 2 a.m. Jan. 1, they ordered several passengers to get off that train and detained some of them, officials said. Grant was among those passengers, though officials have yet to confirm whether he was suspected of being involved in the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART officials have not confirmed the exact time of the shooting. The Oakland Fire Department responded to a call for medical help at 2:13 a.m., and Grant was still breathing at 2:22 a.m. when an American Medical Response ambulance arrived to take him to Highland Hospital, where he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART police and the district attorney's office are continuing to investigate the shooting. Anyone with information is asked to call BART investigators at 877-679-7000, ext. 7040, or the district attorney's office at 510-272-6222.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers have written on Facebook that a protest of the shooting is planned to begin at 3 p.m. today at the Fruitvale station, 3401 East 12th St.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berkeley Copwatch will meet Monday to discuss the New Year's Day killing of a 22-year-old Hayward man who reportedly was shot in the back by a BART police officer while he was restrained facedown on the floor of the Fruitvale station in Oakland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copwatch will meet at 8 p.m. at the Grassroots House, 2022 Blake St. near Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley. The public is welcome to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III was killed about 2 a.m. after the officer appeared to pull his gun from its holster on his right hip and fire directly into Grant's back, according to video aired earlier this week by TV station KTVU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been widespread speculation that the officer may have intended to reach for his Taser stun gun, which many BART police carry. BART officials have said it's not clear if Officer Johannes Mehserle was armed with a Taser during the incident. Tasers are often handed off between officers at shift changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copwatch is calling the killing a &quot;spontaneous, public execution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this incident is not met with widespread, militant response, we can surely expect more of the same,&quot; a Copwatch statement said. &quot;If you have been watching from the sidelines, this might be a good time to unleash your outrage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berkeley Copwatch, a 19-year-old all-volunteer organization, frequently holds a meeting, rally or both whenever there is an officer-involved shooting in the East Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization is based on the idea &quot;that watching the police is a crucial first step in the process of organizing,&quot; officials said. The group does not attempt to interfere in police activity or to resist police misconduct physically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group tries to reduce police violence by directly observing the police on the street, documenting incidents and keeping police accountable, according to background information on the group. The group supports victims whenever possible and seeks to educate the public on their rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND   A BART police officer struggling to handcuff a 22-year-old man stood up over the facedown Hayward resident and fired a single shot into his back while a handful of officers watched, a video taken by a train passenger shows, the attorney for the victim's family said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Burris, the attorney for the family of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III, shot by a BART police officer early New Year's Day, said he plans to file a $25 million lawsuit against the department and asked prosecutors to consider filing murder charges against the officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant died Thursday after being shot by an unidentified BART officer. The shooting occurred shortly before 2 a.m. when five officers responded at the Fruitvale station to reports of a fight on a train, officials said, though they have not confirmed whether Grant was involved in that fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris, a civil rights attorney known for his work in several high-profile cases involving police abuse and corruption, said Sunday he's reviewed three videos of the incident and spoken to several witnesses, and concluded that the incident was &quot;the most unconscionable shooting&quot; he's ever seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Within a day or two, I've drafted a notice of claim against BART for $25 million I plan to submit officially,&quot; said Burris, alleging that the officer had violated Grant's civil rights and caused his wrongful death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting was so outrageous, Burris said, that the Alameda County District Attorney's Office should consider filing charges of second-degree murder or manslaughter against the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART police Chief Gary Gee said Sunday the department is in the early stages of an investigation and declined to discuss many details, as doing so &quot;before all the facts are in could compromise individual recollections and do disservice to the truth and the answers we're all seeking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governor takes aim at paid holidays</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SACRAMENTO   Like much of the nation's workforce, California state employees got to spend New Year's Day at home with their families and still get paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike many in the private sector, state workers are slated to get an additional 13 paid holidays off the rest of this year   including Lincoln and Washington's birthdays in February (four days apart), Cesar Chavez Day in March, Columbus Day in October and Veteran's Day in November. The policy is among the most generous in the nation: only two other states offer government employees more paid holidays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With California facing one of the largest deficits in its history, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is taking aim at that coveted perk of state service. As part of his plan to tame a projected $41.6 billion shortfall through mid-2010, Schwarzenegger has suggested eliminating two of the 14 paid holidays: Lincoln's Birthday and Columbus Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal is one of several by Schwarzenegger aimed at slicing payroll costs, but it is hardly the most Draconian. More controversial is his plan to furlough most workers two days a month, the equivalent of a 10 percent pay cut, through mid-2010. Layoffs will also almost certainly be needed, Schwarzenegger has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MTC rates Bay Area road pavement 'fair'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pavement conditions of the Bay Area's 42,000 miles of streets and roads remain in fair condition, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission said in a report released Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average pavement condition index score in the 2005-07 period edged up only one point to 65 since the 2004-06 period, the MTC said. The maximum possible score is 100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worst pavement condition scores were in Sonoma and Marin counties, Suisun City and Rio Vista in Solano County, and in Orinda, Richmond and El Cerrito.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The greatest decreases in pavement quality were in St. Helena, Pacifica, Newark, Dixon and East Palo Alto, according to the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bay Area News Group and Wire Reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best pavement conditions are found in Los Altos, Brentwood, Foster City, Santa Clara, Contra Costa County, Gilroy, Dublin, and Oakley and in the city of Sonoma, according to the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The region's current average PCI of 65 places the region's pavement quality in the 'fair' category, which is still dangerously close to the point (PCI of 60) where pavement conditions begin to deteriorate very rapidly,&quot; the MTC report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MTC said it costs less money to maintain pavement in good condition, a score between 70 and 79, than it does to repair or replace roads once they go bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once pavement reaches a PCI score of about 60, it begins to deteriorate rapidly and needs more rehabilitation or reconstruction, the MTC report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To attain a PCI of 75 by 2035, the region will have to double the current level of investment in pavement maintenance, the MTC said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While additional funding for roads has not yet been identified, the MTC has directed $7 billion in regional discretionary funding to local roadways over the course of the MTC's Transportation 2035 plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This amount will allow the region to maintain the current state of repair,&quot; said Sui Tan, the MTC's StreetSaver program manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pavement of 12 percent of the Bay Area's roads was rated excellent and 23 percent earned a very good rating. Twenty percent were deemed good and 12 percent were rated fair. Ten percent are &quot;at risk&quot; of rapid deterioration, 14 percent were poor and 8 percent failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The greatest improvement was in the poor or failed condition where local agencies successfully shaved off three percentage points, the MTC said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than comparing the pavement conditions annually, the MTC reports them in a three-year moving average, which provides a better picture of how pavement conditions are performing over time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All 109 Bay area local jurisdictions use the MTC's StreetSaver pavement management software.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news is that we're holding the line on pavement quality. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done, and it's a constant battle against the forces of time, traffic and weather,&quot; MTC Chairman and Napa County Supervisor Bill Dodd said in a news release about the MTC report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of San Mateo boasts the most improved three-year PCI average of 6 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foster City has consistently registered PCI scores of 80 or higher in recent years and Brentwood claims the best roads in the Bay Area, the MTC said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND   Family members of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III, who was shot and killed by a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer early New Year's Day, allege in a $25 million claim they filed today that BART police officers violated his civil rights, illegally detained him and used excessive force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim, filed by attorney John Burris on behalf of Wanda Johnson, Grant's mother, and Sophia Mesa, the mother of Grant's 4-year-old daughter, also names the BART police officer who shot Grant as Johannes Mehserle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant, a 22-year-old Hayward man who worked as a butcher at an Oakland grocery store, &quot;was unarmed and offered no physical resistance to BART police officers&quot; before being shot shortly after 2 a.m. on Jan. 1, according to the claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant was riding BART back to the East Bay &quot;after a night of celebrating New Year's Eve in San Francisco&quot; when an altercation erupted on his train, prompting BART police to meet the train at the Fruitvale station to quash the fight, the claim states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle and other officers, whose names aren't mentioned in the claim, ordered Grant and other passengers to get off the train, according to the claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim states that Grant complied and stepped off the train, but that an unnamed &quot;Latino officer&quot; grabbed Grant's upper body, threw him against a nearby wall and kneed him in the face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant then dropped to his knees and put his hands up &quot;in an effort to demonstrate that he was submitting to the Latino officer's thuggish display of authority,&quot; according to the claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the officer dug his knee into Grant's back, causing Grant to &quot;yell out in agony,&quot; the claim states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant feared for his life and &quot;made a valiant effort to de-escalate the situation by appealing to the officer's sense of humanity by telling the officer that he had a 4-year-old daughter&quot; and asking the officer not to use a Taser gun on him, according to the claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim alleges that Mehserle, who was standing nearby, kneeled down and restrained Grant's hands, then &quot;inexplicably&quot; stood up, drew his firearm and pointed it directly at Grant's back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim states, &quot;Without so much as flinching, Officer Mehserle stood over Mr. Grant and mercilessly fired his weapon, mortally wounding Mr. Grant with a single gunshot sound to the back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video footage of the shooting and witness statements indicate that after Grant was shot officers placed him in handcuffs &quot;without any justification,&quot; the claim states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART spokesman Linton Johnson has not returned calls for comment today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a briefing at BART headquarters on Monday, Johnson told reporters that BART officials won't have much to say about the shooting until their investigation is completed, a process he said will take at least several weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We urge the public to be patient with us,&quot; Johnson said Monday. &quot;It's frustrating to us because people are getting upset about what happened, but we owe it to the public, the family (of Grant) and the police officer to get all the facts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to investigate this quickly but we don't want to have a rush to judgment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris said today that if BART rejects the claim, he will file a lawsuit after 45 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris said he believes Grant was cooperative during the incident and that BART police officers &quot;escalated the situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some police use-of-force experts who have looked at footage of the incident have said that Mehserle may have meant to fire a Taser at Grant but instead mistakenly shot him with a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Burris said, &quot;I'm not sure if that's true&quot; and pointed out that BART hasn't yet said one way or the other if Mehserle had a Taser during the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris said he doesn't think Mehserle had any justification to use even a Taser on Grant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that if Mehserle deliberately shot Grant with a gun, the officer should be prosecuted for second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris said if Mehserle had intended to use a Taser and mistakenly fired his gun, the officer should be prosecuted for involuntary manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's negligence if you pick the wrong weapon,&quot; Burris said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle is on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated by BART and the Alameda County District Attorney's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">District Attorney Tom Orloff, who has the power to file charges against Mehserle if the thinks they are warranted, said today the investigation by his office may take several weeks because it will take time to complete the autopsy protocol and toxicology reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, his office may need to re-interview witnesses, Orloff said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A memorial service will be held for Grant at 11 a.m. Wednesday at Palma Ceia Baptist Church, located at 28605 Ruus Road in Hayward.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dianne Feinstein will be remembered as one of the prime Democratic enablers of the Bush administration and someone who looked the other way as torture became official American policy. Unlike Feinstein, Leon Panetta actually condemned torture as &quot;illegal, immoral, dangerous and counterproductive.&quot; It is to President-elect Obama's credit that he is seeking to staff his administration with those untainted by this moral outrage. Feinstein voted for all of President Bush's nominees to run the CIA, including illegal-wiretapping advocate Michael Hayden. That she is &quot;cool&quot; to Panetta's nomination should be seen as a ringing endorsement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excellent choice. A well-respected politician with absolutely no intelligence experience. Perhaps we can solve the perceived problems within the San Jose Police Department by appointing a well-respected and qualified auto mechanic or public school teacher to the position of chief of police? Surely there is at least one member of the intelligence community in Washington who has served the CIA with bipartisan honor over a long career who would be overwhelmingly qualified for the position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also disturbing that Barack Obama would not have consulted with Sen. Dianne Feinstein as a senior member of his own party as well as head of the Senate Intelligence Committee. As an Obama supporter, I'm beginning to have some doubts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To understand the present moment in Gaza, one must go back to the Egypt-brokered cease-fire of last June. In agreeing to the cessation of hostilities, Hamas let it be known that it planned to use the truce period to reinforce its arms-smuggling tunnel network and acquire new rockets to replace the thousands they had showered on Israel during the period leading up to the cease-fire. Hamas lived up to its word and began shelling Israel in earnest once again. After warning Hamas repeatedly that it would retaliate if the terrorist group failed to stop the newest barrage of rockets, Israel has lived up to its word, too.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the Fruitvale BART station is truly a tragedy. As a past participant of a Citizens Police Academy, I was placed in &quot;use of force&quot; scenarios in which I had to make split-second decisions involving use of force, which could have ended or saved a life. Based on that experience, I believe it's possible for an officer to inadvertently pull and fire a gun, in that split-second, thinking it was his or her Taser. Careless? Yes. Intentional? NO!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">$25 million won't return Mr. Grant to his family, however, it could be used to help reduce crime and further train officers to guarantee this tragedy doesn't happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lives are impacted by this tragedy: the victim; his family and friends and a police officer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article on the high stress at Mission San Jose High School could have been about Lynbrook High School in San Jose. Our children attended Lynbrook and we saw all these things and the same stress-reduction strategies. They don't work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solutions need to start where the pressure starts   colleges. No extra grade points should be given for Advanced Placement classes. (AP class &quot;A&quot; = 5 points not 4.) They should set minimum SAT scores, GPAs, etc. for admission, then have a lottery for qualified students. Meeting the standards frees students to follow other interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alternating test days in high school is great, but that's not the problem; it is too much material overall. No student should be allowed to take more than two AP classes at a time. The students are in high school, not college.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No sports? Study, work, volunteer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronald E. McKee (Letters, Jan. 5) assumes that without school athletics, East Side teenagers will have nothing to do after school and will inevitably drift into gangs and criminal activity. Here's a radical idea for an after-school activity   quit whining and hit the books, kids. If there's time after mastering math, history and English, students have an almost endless array of positive opportunities   part-time work, volunteer work, helping out needy neighbors, cleaning the house/yard, etc. Schools cutting back on the arts didn't lead to an increase in crime and the assumption that a lack of athletics will result in crime is completely without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND, Calif. (AP)   Law enforcement officials urged patience while they investigated details surrounding the fatal New Year's Day shooting of a 22-year-old man by a transit agency police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bay Area Rapid Transit Police Chief Gary Gee said on Sunday that the agency is &quot;committed to completing an unbiased, thorough and detailed investigation&quot; of the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case is not even four days cold. We're in the early stages of the investigation and we will do a very thorough job,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several unanswered questions remained after BART officers went to Oakland's Fruitvale station to investigate reports of a supposed brawl on a train on which Grant was riding around 2 a.m. Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A friend of Grant's who was with him on the crowded Oakland train station platform at the time of the shooting said Grant pleaded with officers not to harm him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oscar yelled, 'You shot me! I got a four-year-old daughter,'&quot; said Fernando Anicete. &quot;Oscar was telling us to calm down and we did. We weren't looking for any trouble.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anicete was among more than 50 people attending a tearful news conference in Oakland on Sunday where Grant's family announced they planned to file a $25 million claim against the Bay Area Rapid Transit agency this week. A claim is the first step in the process of suing the agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family's attorney John Burris said the shooting was intentional, and that he planned to ask Alameda County prosecutors to seek criminal charges against the officer. Burris said Grant, of Hayward, Calif., posed no threat to officers when a bullet entered his back and ricocheted to his lung area, killing him almost instantly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The officer leaned (in), was straddling over him and pointed his gun directly into the backside and shot (Grant),&quot; said Burris, adding that Grant was handcuffed   after he was shot. &quot;This was not a deadly force situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gee said BART police are fully cooperating with the district attorney's investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant's mother, Wanda Johnson, and Sophina Mesa, his daughter's mother, wept uncontrollably as Burris spoke about Grant. They did not speak, but several said Grant, a butcher at a supermarket near the train station where he was killed, was a loving father showing signs of maturation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cephus &quot;Bobby&quot; Johnson, Grant's uncle, said he text messaged his nephew just after midnight Thursday saying, &quot;Happy New Year ... I love you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson never got a reply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wondered why he didn't text me back,&quot; a teary-eyed Johnson said. &quot;And then I found out why.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART spokesman Jim Allison has said the officer's gun went off while police were trying to restrain Grant and that Grant was not cuffed. The unidentified officer is on paid leave as BART investigates the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mario Pangelina, Mesa's brother who was riding on the same train, two cars behind Grant on Thursday morning, said Sunday he saw Grant beg police not to Taser him because of his child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He kept saying, 'Please, please don't Tase me,'&quot; Pangelina said. &quot;He was not acting hostile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other witnesses said Grant was lying on his stomach on the station's platform when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recordings of the shooting by witnesses have surfaced and Burris said BART had confiscated numerous cell phone images from others he believes contain additional footage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Services for Grant will be held Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But recently discovered video captured by station cameras, which record to a separate network than the one BART police monitor, was &quot;benign&quot; and showed nothing of any significance to the shooting, BART spokesman Linton Johnson said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a hodgepodge of cameras throughout the BART system, and we are in the process of bringing them all to standard,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;At $2 (million) to $5 million per station and 45 stations, that's going to be hard in this economy, but we're working on it. &quot;... We wanted them yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to other news reports, some have speculated that the officer may have intended to reach for a Taser stun gun, with which many BART police officers are equipped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said they are not sure whether the officer in question was armed with a Taser during the incident. BART police Chief Garry Gee said the weapons are handed off from officer to officer as shifts begin and end, and it was not clear from police records whether the officer had acquired one at the beginning of his shift that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tasers are gun-shaped and kept on the officer's belt, on the opposite side of the .40-caliber semi-automatic pistols that the department issues, Gee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART officials also did not say Monday how long it took for Grant to receive medical care after being shot. Johnson said BART was looking into the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mario Pangelina Jr., whose sister had a 4-year-old daughter with Grant and who said he witnessed events surrounding the shooting, told reporters Sunday that he was forced aboard a train and had to leave the scene after seeing Grant lying on the floor after being shot. When Pangelina later saw footage of the scene captured by the media, he recognized Grant lying in the same position as when he'd been shot, Pangelina said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He estimated the time that had passed between the shooting and the beginning of the media footage as at least 20 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alameda District Attorney Tom Orloff said BART police thus far have cooperated fully with his office's investigation into the shooting. Asked to respond to a public request made Sunday by an attorney representing Grant's family that Orloff's office consider charges of second-degree murder or manslaughter against the officer, Orloff said no courses of action have been ruled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our position is not to critique police procedures or training,&quot; Orloff said. &quot;Our function is to determine whether or not a criminal offense has been committed by the officer that should be pursued.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orloff declined to predict how long the investigation will continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Realistically, by the time everybody's been talked to, the toxicology's been done, and all the basic stuff is in, it's almost always a matter of weeks, not days,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND   A BART police officer struggling to handcuff a 22-year-old man, stood up over the face-down Hayward resident and fired a single shot into his back while a handful of officers watched, a video taken by a train passenger showed Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorney for the family of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III, fatally shot by an unidentified BART police officer early New Year's Day, said Sunday he plans to file a $25 million lawsuit against the department and asked prosecutors to consider filing murder charges against the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting occurred a little before 2a.m. Thursday after five officers responded to the Fruitvale station to reports of a fight on a train, officials said, though they have not confirmed whether Grant was involved in that fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights attorney John Burris, known for his work in several high-profile cases involving police abuse and corruption, said at a Sunday press conference he has reviewed three videos of the incident and spoken to several witnesses, and concluded the incident was &quot;the most unconscionable shooting&quot; he has ever seen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've drafted a notice of claim against BART for $25 million I plan to submit officially,&quot; Burris said, adding that the officer had violated Grant's civil rights and caused his wrongful death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urged to file charges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting was so outrageous, Burris said, that the Alameda County District Attorney should consider filing charges of either second-degree murder or manslaughter against the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new video, obtained by television station KTVU, shows two officers restraining a struggling suspect. While the man is lying face-down on the ground, one officer is seen pulling out a gun and firing a single shot into his back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department is in the early stages of a thorough investigation, BART Police Chief Gary Gee said Sunday at a press conference. He declined to discuss many details, as doing so &quot;before all the facts are in could compromise individual recollections and do disservice to the truth and the answers we're all seeking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART police are cooperating fully with a parallel investigation by the Alameda County District Attorney, Gee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gee declined to identify the officer, but said he came to the BART police from an academy and had served two years. The officer was issued a drug and alcohol test before being sent home on administrative leave Thursday, Gee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last officer-involved shooting for BART police occurred in May 2001, Gee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witness describes scene</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mario Pangelina Jr., whose sister had a 4-year-old daughter with Grant, said he was on the same train as Grant that night, but on a different car. He said he saw Grant's interactions with police immediately before the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, an officer grabbed Oscar by the neck and pushed him against the wall,&quot; Pangelina said. &quot;Oscar didn't fight him, but he didn't go down either. He was like, 'What did I do?' Then another officer came up with his Taser and held it right in his face. Oscar said, 'Please don't shoot me, please don't Tase me, I have a daughter,' over and over again, real fast, and he sat down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pangelina said he didn't see the actual shooting, but Burris said after reviewing three videos and interviewing several witnesses he had a clear picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant was the only man in a small group sitting against the wall who was not handcuffed, Burris said, so officers grabbed him away from the wall and pressed him belly-down onto the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One officer was kneeling over his neck and head, and another standing over him,&quot; Burris said. &quot;He was not kicking, and one officer was pulling on his arm. The standing officer pulled out his weapon and, within moments, fired the gun into Mr. Grant's back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris said the bullet went through Grant's lower back and ricocheted off the ground up into his lungs, killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART's 206 sworn officers attend the same academies and training programs as city police and sheriff's deputies. According to BART's Web site, its requirements go beyond state guidelines, as every officer applicant must have completed at least one year of college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not clear to me why the officer felt he needed to shoot. I don't know, and from my perspective it doesn't matter,&quot; Burris said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video analyzed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two authorities on police use of deadly force, both former law enforcement officers, said the newly discovered tape leaves unanswered questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Strictly on the basis of this video, it is impossible to determine whether the shooting was justified because the officer who fired the shot might have seen some imminent threat to his or others' lives that the camera does not detect at that distance, angle and resolution,&quot; said Michael Scott, a University of Wisconsin Law professor, former police chief in Florida and co-author of &quot;Deadly Force: What We Know.&quot; Curtis J. Cope agreed that the tape doesn't show enough to draw clear conclusions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are so many things we don't know,&quot; said Cope, a former 30-year law enforcement officer who has conducted police training and provides expert testimony in police procedure cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We certainly don't know the reason why they decided to put him prone on the ground. We don't know what reactions were taking place, what orders were being given and whether or not he is then complying or not complying ... You need to look at every possible angle of it. Those angles all take time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant was a hardworking butcher at popular grocery store Farmer Joe's and a loving father, family members said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was so happy with his daughter,&quot; said Lita Gomez, sister to the mother of Grant's child. &quot;You could see he was just so happy when he looked at her. Now, he's not going to be there for kindergarten. He's not going to be there for her prom. He's not going to be there for her wedding. She was robbed of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Year's shooting was not the first time a BART officer shot a suspect in the back. In 1992, BART officer Fred Crabtree was cleared of wrongdoing after he shot an unarmed 19-year-old man, Jerrold Hall, from behind at the Hayward station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crabtree died in 1996, apparently hanging himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members erected a memorial for Grant outside the Fruitvale BART station Saturday night, where they said they plan to continue honoring his memory for 10 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A public funeral service is planned for 11a.m. Wednesday at Palma Ceia Baptist Church, 28605 Ruus Rd. in Hayward, family members said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gee asked anyone with information on the shooting to call BART investigators at 877-679-7000, ext. 7040, or the Alameda County DA's office at 510-272-6222.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer David Betancourt, a 22-year law enforcement veteran, shot a naked Bruce Seward outside the Hayward BART station before dawn on Memorial Day in 2001. Seward, 42, was asleep on a bench and appeared unconscious. After calling for an ambulance, Betancourt approached when Seward woke up, grabbed the officer's nightstick and swung, smacking the patrol car, police said. Betancourt used pepper spray on Seward, but it had no effect, police said. Family members and mental health advocates decried the shooting, but a BART review cleared Betancourt of wrongdoing. BART police Officer Fred Crabtree was cleared of wrongdoing after he shot an unarmed 19-year-old man, Jerrold Hall, from behind at the Hayward station in 1992. Crabtree died in 1996, apparently hanging himself. Hall's father, Cornelius Hall, sued the agency and won what he calls a small settlement.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

He declined to discuss many details, as doing so &quot;before all the facts are in could compromise individual recollections and do disservice to the truth and the answers we're all seeking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART police are cooperating fully with a parallel investigation by the Alameda County district attorney's office, Gee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gee declined to identify the officer but said he is a two-year BART police veteran. The officer was given drug and alcohol tests before being sent home on administrative leave Thursday, Gee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last BART officer-involved shooting occurred in May 2001, Gee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mario Pangelina Jr., whose sister had a 4-year-old daughter with Grant, said he was on the same train as Grant that night, but on a different car. He said he saw Grant's interactions with police immediately before the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, an officer grabbed Oscar by the neck and pushed him against the wall,&quot; Pangelina said. &quot;Oscar didn't fight him, but he didn't go down either. He was like, 'What did I do?' Then another officer came up with his Taser and held it right in his face. Oscar said, 'Please don't shoot me, please don't Taser me, I have a daughter,' over and over again, real fast, and he sat down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant was the only man in a small group sitting against the wall who was not handcuffed, Burris said, so officers grabbed him away from the wall and pressed him belly-down onto the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One officer was kneeling over his neck and head, and another standing over him,&quot; Burris said. &quot;He was not kicking, and one officer was pulling on his arm. The standing officer pulled out his weapon and, within moments, fired the gun into Mr. Grant's back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris said the bullet went through Grant's lower back and ricocheted off the ground up into his lungs, killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART's 206 sworn officers attend the same academies and training programs as city police and sheriff's deputies. According to BART's Web site, its requirements go beyond state guidelines, as every officer applicant must have completed at least a year of college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have one video of the incident in evidence, different from the video that local media have released, and the quality of that video makes it hard to reach a sure conclusion, Gee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not clear to me why the officer felt he needed to shoot. I don't know, and from my perspective it doesn't matter,&quot; Burris said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two authorities on police use of deadly force, both former law enforcement officers, said the newly discovered tape leaves unanswered questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Strictly on the basis of this video, it is impossible to determine whether the shooting was justified because the officer who fired the shot might have seen some imminent threat to his or others' lives that the camera does not detect at that distance, angle and resolution,&quot; said Michael Scott, a University of Wisconsin law professor, former police chief in Florida and co-author of &quot;Deadly Force: What We Know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott said he watched the video several times. If there was a threat, he wrote in an e-mail to the Times, it &quot;would most likely have to be a firearm or other weapon in the possession of Mr. Grant. However, if it turns out that Mr. Grant had no such weapon, it is awfully difficult to imagine what might have justified the use of deadly force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curtis J. Cope agreed that the tape doesn't show enough to draw clear conclusions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are so many things we don't know,&quot; said Cope, a former 30-year law enforcement officer who has conducted police training and provides expert testimony in police procedure cases. &quot;We certainly don't know the reason why they decided to put him prone on the ground. We don't know what reactions were taking place, what orders were being given and whether or not he is then complying or not complying. ... You need to look at every possible angle of it. Those angles all take time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant was a butcher at popular Oakland grocery store Farmer Joe's and a loving father, family members said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was so happy with his daughter,&quot; said Lita Gomez, sister to the mother of Grant's child. &quot;You could see he was just so happy when he looked at her. Now, he's not going to be there for kindergarten. He's not going to be there for her prom. He's not going to be there for her wedding. She was robbed of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members erected a memorial for Grant outside the Fruitvale BART station Saturday night, where they said they plan to continue honoring his memory for 10 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A public funeral service is planned for 11 a.m. Wednesday at Palma Ceia Baptist Church, 28605 Ruus Road in Hayward, family members said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gee asked anyone with information on the shooting to call BART investigators at 877-679-7000, ext. 7040, or the Alameda County district attorney's office at 510-272-6222.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c11"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer David Betancourt, a 22-year law enforcement veteran, shot a naked Bruce Seward outside the Hayward BART station before dawn on Memorial Day in 2001. Seward, 42, was asleep on a bench and appeared unconscious. After calling for an ambulance, Betancourt approached when Seward woke up, grabbed the officer's nightstick and swung, smacking the patrol car, police said. Betancourt used pepper spray on Seward, but it had no effect, police said. Family members and mental health advocates decried the shooting, but a BART review cleared Betancourt of wrongdoing. BART police Officer Fred Crabtree was cleared of wrongdoing after he shot an unarmed 19-year-old man, Jerrold Hall, from behind at the Hayward station in 1992. Crabtree died in 1996, apparently hanging himself. Hall's father, Cornelius Hall, sued the agency and won what he calls a small settlement. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to Media &amp; Public on 1/4/09 During News Conference</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of the BART Police Department and the entire BART organization, we want to express our condolences to the family of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to assure Mr. Grant's family and the public that we are taking this investigation very seriously. And, we are committed to complete an unbiased and thorough investigation into what happened on the morning of New Year's Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to our investigation, we are fully cooperating with the Alameda County District Attorney's office, which is conducting a parallel and independent investigation. We are providing all of the evidence of our investigation to the District Attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is not even four days old - we are in the early stages of the investigation and will do a thorough job. We are reviewing all of the evidence, including videos, witness statements, and physical evidence as we compile a complete and accurate account of what happened on in the early morning of January First.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As frustrating as it is, I want to stress that we cannot and will not jeopardize this case by discussing details before the investigation is complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some have already begun to draw conclusions and speculate about what happened well before all the facts are in, doing so may compromise independent recollections from witnesses and does a disservice to getting at the answers we are seeking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We continue to ask people to come forward if they have any evidence or eyewitness accounts. They can call our tip line at (877) 679-7000, extension 7040. Or, they wish to present their information directly to the Alameda County DA's office. The DA's general number is (510) 272-6222.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We ask for the public to be patient, refrain from jumping to conclusions, and allow the investigators do their jobs. As has been previously said, there is very little information that can be released at this time. I can, however, provide some basic facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are investigating an incident early New Year's Day at the Fruitvale BART Station in which Mr. Grant was fatally wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The involved officer is a two-year veteran of the BART Police force. That officer underwent drug and alcohol testing and is on administrative leave, which is standard procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident began when BART police received a report that two groups of riders were involved in an altercation on a train after it left West Oakland Station around 2 a.m. BART police officers responded to the platform at Fruitvale and detained several persons. Our preliminary investigation indicates that Mr. Grant was not in handcuffs at the time of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I cannot tell you when this investigation will be completed. But, again, I assure you that we are committed to conducting an accurate and thorough investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We recognize that it is frustrating that we cannot answer many of your questions right now - but doing so could lead to speculation and compromise the integrity of the ongoing investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, we ask for your patience and I thank you for coming.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND   A BART police officer struggling to handcuff a 22-year-old man stood up over the facedown Hayward resident and fired a single shot into his back while a handful of officers watched, a video taken by a train passenger shows, the attorney for the victim's family said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Burris, the attorney for the family of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III, shot by a BART police officer early New Year's Day, said he plans to file a $25 million lawsuit against the department and asked prosecutors to consider filing murder charges against the officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant died Thursday after being shot by an unidentified BART officer. The shooting occurred shortly before 2 a.m. when five officers responded at the Fruitvale station to reports of a fight on a train, officials said, though they have not confirmed whether Grant was involved in that fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris, a civil rights attorney known for his work in several high-profile cases involving police abuse and corruption, said Sunday he's reviewed three videos of the incident and spoken to several witnesses, and concluded that the incident was &quot;the most unconscionable shooting&quot; he's ever seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Within a day or two, I've drafted a notice of claim against BART for $25 million I plan to submit officially,&quot; Burris said, alleging that the officer had violated Grant's civil rights and caused his wrongful death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting was so outrageous, Burris said, that the Alameda County district attorney should consider filing charges of second-degree murder or manslaughter against the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART Police Chief Gary Gee said Sunday the department is in the early stages of an investigation and declined to discuss many details, as doing so &quot;before all the facts are in could compromise individual recollections and do disservice to the truth and the answers we're all seeking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART police are cooperating fully with a parallel investigation into the shooting by the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, and sharing all evidence with the office, Gee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gee declined to identify the officer but said he came to the BART police department straight out of the academy and had served two years. The officer was administered a drug and alcohol test before being sent home on paid administrative leave Thursday, Gee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last officer-involved shooting by BART police occurred in May 2001, Gee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Year's shooting was not the first time a BART officer shot a suspect in the back. In 1992, BART officer Fred Crabtree was cleared of wrongdoing after he shot an unarmed 19-year-old man, Jerrold Hall, from behind at the Hayward station. Crabtree died in 1996, apparently hanging himself. Hall's father, Cornelius Hall, sued the agency and won what he calls a small settlement, but said he never got what he wanted: an independent BART police review board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without it, he said on Sunday from his home in Alabama, &quot;It's like the fox watching the henhouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mario Pangelina, Jr., whose sister had a 4-year-old daughter with Grant, said he was on the same train as Grant that night but on a different car. He said he saw Grant's interactions with police immediately before the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, an officer grabbed Oscar by the neck and pushed him against the wall,&quot; Pangelina said. &quot;Oscar didn't fight him, but he didn't go down either. He was like, 'What did I do?' Then another officer came up with his Taser and held it right in his face. Oscar said, 'Please don't shoot me, please don't Taser me, I have a daughter,' over and over again, real fast, and he sat down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members set up a memorial site for Grant outside the Fruitvale BART station Saturday night, where they said they plan to continue honoring his memory for 10 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A public funeral is planned for Wednesday at 11 a.m. at Palma Ceia Baptist Church, 28605 Ruus Road, Hayward. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was unarmed when he was shot by a BART police officer who was standing over him at the Fruitvale station early on New Year's Day, said Oakland civil rights attorney John Burris, who has been hired by the victim's family to investigate the death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant, 22, of San Leandro, was fatally shot on the BART platform shortly before 2 a.m. Thursday, police said. BART officers were called to the station in response to reports of fighting between two groups of men on board a train bound for the Dublin-Pleasanton station. BART officials will only say the officer's gun &quot;discharged.&quot; BART officials have said Grant was unarmed and no weapons were recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remained unclear Saturday whether Grant was involved in the fight and whether he was one of the men put in plastic &quot;flexi-cuffs,&quot; which police often use as handcuffs when dealing with a large number of people. BART officials say he was not restrained. Witnesses dispute that claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris said Saturday that Grant did not move and was not trying to overpower the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's an outrageous set of facts,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART officials have not released the name of the officer who shot Grant. The officer has worked for the rapid transit agency for about two years, a BART spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The train had come from San Francisco and was stopped at the Fruitvale station to allow officers to board the train and break up the suspected fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART police and the Alameda County District Attorney's Office are also investigating the shooting. Anyone with information about the incident can call BART police at 877-679-7000, ext. 7040.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris, who has not been retained as the family's lawyer at this point, said he expects the shooting to be part of some sort of legal action   possibly even criminal charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the witness statements are accurate, that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was shot while lying unarmed and on his stomach, shot by a police officer standing over him, that raises the possibility of criminal conduct,&quot; Burris said. &quot;You shouldn't shoot an unarmed person who is not posing a threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART spokesman Jim Allison did not offer much new information Friday about the shooting, except to confirm Grant was shot once. Allison did not say where on his body Grant was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not release the name of the officer involved in the shooting and would only say that the officer had been with BART two years. He would not say if the officer had previously worked at another police department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer is being represented by a Sacramento law firm. A call to that office was not returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allison also reconfirmed that surveillance cameras at the station do not record. He said station cameras &quot;historically&quot; have not recorded what they view and are there primarily for &quot;counterterrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART police did seize some cell phones from people on the platform who said they had used the phones' cameras to record what happened. None of those images have been released to the media, and Allison said he could not talk about evidence collected at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART officers arrived at the Fruitvale station about 2 a.m. Thursday in response to reports of fighting between two groups of men onboard a train. BART officials will only say the officer's gun &quot;discharged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear whether Grant was involved in the fight and whether he was one of the men put in plastic &quot;flexi cuffs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allison said Friday that according to BART's preliminary investigation, Grant was not restrained with the cuffs when he was shot, which is disputed by people who were with Grant, a former student at Mount Eden High School in Hayward. Allison also could not say whether the officer carried a stun gun or Taser, as some BART officers do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART police and the Alameda County district attorney's office are investigating the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris said it is his understanding that Grant was not handcuffed when he was shot, but that handcuffs were put on him afterward, possibly because officers feared he might get violent, and that the cuffs later were removed by other police officers. Burris said it was not unusual to cuff someone after he has been shot if officers believe the injured party might get violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burris, who has met with several witnesses, said witnesses consistently have claimed Grant was shot while on his stomach. Burris was told that the officer had his gun drawn when Grant was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've heard comments that the gun 'discharged,'&quot; Burris said. &quot;That suggests it was not fired. I find that hard to accept   these guns have strong pulls on (the trigger). If they go off without the officer firing it, that is a defective gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allison did say Friday that BART police officers are trained not to place their index fingers on their weapons until they feel deadly force will be necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART police ask anyone with information about the incident to call 877-679-7000, ext. 7040.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND (AP)   A 22-year-old man died Thursday after being shot on an Oakland train station platform by a transit agency police officer responding to reports of fighting on an arriving train, officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bay Area Rapid Transit officer's gun went off while police were trying to restrain </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at BART's Fruitvale station about 2:15 a.m., agency spokesman Jim Allison said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant was taken to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead early Thursday, Allison said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities said they were investigating whether the gun was fired on purpose or accidentally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's clear that it was a volatile situation with young men who were arguing and in fact had continued to argue even in the presence of multiple police officers,&quot; Allison said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five officers had gathered on the platform as the train arrived from San Francisco following reports that two groups of men were fighting on the train near the West Oakland station two stops earlier, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men continued to yell at each other after the train stopped, and police were in the process of separating the men when the bullet struck Grant, Allison said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one involved in the alleged fighting was arrested following the incident. Two men were detained for questioning but released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials have not publicly identified the officer, who has served on the force for just under two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer was placed on administrative leave as authorities investigate whether proper police procedures had been followed and whether the shooting was a crime, Allison said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was identified by his family and authorities as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 22. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting occurred about 2:15 a.m. on the platform where a Dublin-Pleasanton train from San Francisco had stopped, BART spokesman Jim Allison said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said reports came in about 2 a.m. that two groups of riders were involved in an altercation on the train as it left the West Oakland Station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five BART police officers patrolling the Fruitvale station responded to the call when the train pulled into the station. Police separated the arguing parties, removed them from the train and detained them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During that process, an officer's gun discharged, wounding Grant, authorities said. BART's preliminary investigation indicates that Grant was not handcuffed at the time, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant was taken to Highland Hospital Oakland, where he died later Thursday morning. His place of residence was not released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the BART police investigation, the Alameda County District Attorney's Office will conduct an independent probe, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer involved in the shooting was not identified. He underwent drug and alcohol testing and has been placed on administrative leave, as is standard procedure, BART officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fruitvale station was closed until about 2:50 a.m. because of police activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART police are seeking the public's help as they continue to investigate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much for a wild New Year's Eve. Although it may have been rocking for some, Bay Area streets, for the most part, remained relatively calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">San Jose police reported no major violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was nothing out of the ordinary,&quot; officer Enrique Garcia said. &quot;People obviously went out and had a good time, but they were responsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, there were the usual suspects: drivers arrested under the influence of alcohol and drugs. There were 438 such arrests throughout California from 6 p.m. Wednesday through 6 a.m. Thursday. In the Bay Area, 84 drivers were arrested, more than double last year's total of 41.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven people died on California roads compared with four last year, according to the California Highway Patrol's preliminary figures. In the Bay Area, two traffic deaths were reported, in Solano and Sonoma counties. None was reported in the area last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's difficult to say why they are up,&quot; CHP officer Hugo Mendoza said. &quot;There's more people out there drinking and driving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase in arrests also could be attributed to CHP's maximum enforcement period, when the agency has 80 percent of its force patrolling the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, 125 law enforcement agencies were on the streets and freeways as part of Bay Area Regional Avoid anti-DUI efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite fears that downtown Santa Cruz might become a bit raucous with more than 10,000 people hitting the streets on New Year's Eve, police reported only 10 arrests based on minor infractions including public intoxication, narcotics possession, battery and parole violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 36 people were arrested in San Francisco, most of them on suspicion of public drunkenness, others of various misdemeanors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there were some areas where violence did mar the calmness of New Year's morning. In Oakland, one man died after being shot by a BART police officer at 2:15 a.m. Thursday. The incident occurred at the Fruitvale BART station after a confrontation on the Dublin/Pleasanton bound-train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer was on the platform after reports of an altercation on the train near the West Oakland station two stops earlier. Shortly after the train arrived at the Fruitvale station from San Francisco, police separated the arguing parties, and during that process the officer's gun discharged, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART identified the dead man as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 22. The identity of the officer was not immediately released.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan. 8--OAKLAND -- The BART police officer under investigation for the fatal New Year's Day shooting of an unarmed man quit his job Wednesday rather than speak with investigators, an official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former officer Johannes Mehserle, 27, has given no comment to BART investigators since the incident in which cell phone videos appeared to capture Mehserle shooting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III as Grant lay facedown on the ground at the Fruitvale station, BART spokesman Linton Johnson said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a meeting scheduled for him to talk, and his attorney and a union rep came in his place and dropped off a letter of resignation instead,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;It's interesting, because he was supposed to be talking for the administrative part of our investigation, which is privileged information and couldn't have been used in any criminal investigation anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While BART officials said they've been trying to get Mehserle to talk ever since the shooting, Mehserle's attorney said he hadn't received any requests for an interview from Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff's office as of Wednesday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In general, a prosecutor would contact the attorney of anyone under investigation for a crime,&quot; said Christopher Miller, Mehserle's Sacramento-based union attorney. &quot;So that would have come to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orloff declined Wednesday to discuss any details of his office's investigation with the media, citing a standing policy his office has to allow police departments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to act as the main public face of any officer-involved shooting investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've confirmed the investigation, and that's about as much as we'll say,&quot; Orloff said. &quot;The normal thing in a situation like this is to interview anyone who can shed light on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle's resignation takes away BART's ability to leverage a statement out of him, since he can no longer be fired for remaining silent, Orloff said. Orloff met with a group of about 50 clergy and community members in his office, after they held a rally outside the Oakland courthouse and packed the lobby outside his office with wall-to-wall demonstrators demanding he meet with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the demonstrators was Oakland Councilmember Desley Brooks (Eastmont-Seminary), who called the shooting an &quot;execution&quot; and demanded an explanation of the behavior of the other officers present during the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brooks and the clergy spoke with a crowd of about 100 people outside the courthouse just after 9 a.m. and said they'd been denied a meeting with Orloff and demanded swift justice for Grant's killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What shall we tell our sons?&quot; said the Rev. Dr. J. Alfred Smith Sr. of Alan Temple Baptist Church. &quot;Shall we tell them to fear the law? Is the law their enemy? If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not safe, then I am not safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Christopher Muhammad of the Nation of Islam said Mehserle should be arrested immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is left to investigate? The whole world has seen this,&quot; Muhammad said, referring to widespread Internet videos taken from witnesses' cell phones. &quot;We can discuss his mindset later. But right now he should be detained and held on criminal charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a demonstration in protest of the shooting Wednesday afternoon at the Fruitvale station, Grant's younger sister, Audrena Gilbert, said Mehserle has not talked to the bereaved family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want him to start. I want him to apologize for what he did,&quot; said Gilbert, 19, of Oakland. &quot;I want him to tell the truth, why he shot him, what he shot him for. That's all I want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The afternoon protest, which had a microphone open for anyone to speak but was led by speakers for the Coalition Against Police Executions, drew a crowd of 500 people, police estimated. The station was temporarily shut down, and trains let passengers off at stations on either side of the stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not enough the officer resigned today,&quot; said Sean Dugar, president of the California National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Youth and College Division. &quot;We demand he be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. &quot;... We shut down one BART station this afternoon. Let's do another one next week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speakers at both the morning and afternoon protests led the crowd in a call-and-return chant, shouting, &quot;I am </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several clergymen at the morning protest, speakers at the Fruitvale station protest and Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums all expressed an understanding for the community's anger but urged demonstrators to refrain from violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we handle ourselves in this moment, so shall our children,&quot; Dellums said. &quot;I think that in a community that's trying to get its hands around violence, that it's important for us to maintain the integrity of a peaceful community going forward, even in this moment of great anger, great loss and great tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this appeal, protesters shouted angrily at a representative from Dellums' office sent to the Fruitvale station, and when the crowd later moved toward Lake Merritt, it prompted the police shutdown of the BART station there Members of the crowd lit a Dumpster's contents on fire and rammed the container into a police car. Dellums said the city of Oakland and its Police Department should not become involved in the shooting investigation at this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You deal with the appropriate agencies on the ground, and I think right now that's Bay Area Rapid Transit and that's the district attorney's office,&quot; he said. &quot;At this point, I view my role as simply trying to articulate the pain and the sorrow and even the anger that people feel at the loss of human life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dave Rose, a retired Placer County sheriff's lieutenant who's now an expert witness on police use of force and the co-author of &quot;Police Use-of-Force Case Law,&quot; said every bit of Mehserle's training and all circumstances of the situation on the BART platform that night must be taken into account. All the videos should be professionally enhanced and then reviewed frame by frame for every detail, every twitch, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on Mehserle's experience and how officers react physiologically in high-stress situations, Rose said, it could well have been nothing more than a tragic, noncriminal accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But UC Berkeley Boalt Hall Law School professor Franklin Zimring, a criminal justice expert, said &quot;absolutely conclusive&quot; videos of the shooting have convinced him there's no possible justification for Mehserle's actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Normally, what you get in a police deadly force interaction is a 'he said, she said' in which there's at least an accusation like, 'There was a flash of metal as he reached toward his pocket,'&quot;&acirc;[#x20ac]&deg;&quot; Zimring said. &quot;But this guy was already down on the ground. &quot;... He's not in a position to be threatening anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Use of deadly force is considered &quot;in terms of a threat to the physical safety of the officer or somebody else, and there's none there in this case,&quot; he added. &quot;So it's accident versus intention, but justification is off the table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Mehserle meant to draw his Taser but accidentally drew his firearm, or whether he meant to draw his sidearm but didn't mean to fire it, it looks like involuntary manslaughter, Zimring said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My money is on that second horse: I think it was an accident, but I don't think the drawing of the gun was an accident,&quot; he said, noting it probably wouldn't have been appropriate to draw the Taser but &quot;under no circumstance I could imagine&quot; should Mehserle have drawn his firearm given what's seen on the videos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimring said accidental shootings by officers are rarely charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They don't even have to meet criminal juries most of the time, but most of the time there's a plausible officer vulnerability,&quot; he said. &quot;That's what juries can identify with, and that's what's missing in action here. If I were a U.S. or prosecuting attorney, I would not be afraid of taking a criminal case here, certainly for involuntary manslaughter, before an Alameda County jury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of a statement from Mehserle, the proper thing to do is to charge the case based on the evidence at hand and then hear his side of the story later, Zimring said: &quot;Not giving a statement in this context may be motivated by an unwillingness to incriminate oneself, but it also deprives the officer of an opportunity to allege that the conduct was unintended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there isn't a criminal investigation in this case, I think it will be an enduring scandal,&quot; he said, &quot;and therefore I think that you're going to see an investigation, and you're going to see it in a matter of a very few days.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5:30 p.m. OPD will investigate shooting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oakland Police Department will investigate the shooting of an unarmed man on a BART train as officials face public clamor for answers in the New Year's Day shooting that has led to massive protests in the streets of Oakland, officials announced Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OPD's role will to be to aid the Alameda County District Attorney's office, which had previously been working exclusively with BART police, to determine whether criminal charges against the officer who pulled the trigger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will review what has been done and we will develop our own witnesses as well,&quot; said Oakland police Chief Wayne Tucker. &quot;That's what's intended now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART Police Chief Gary Gee welcomed the additional resources the Oakland Police Department will provide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I fully support his partnership,&quot; he said. &quot;The BART and Oakland police departments have always enjoyed an excellent working relationship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff said he expected a case to be &quot;totally prepared&quot; in about two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know people are unhappy with that,&quot; he said. &quot;I know there's a lot of emotion. I have to sit back and look at this as objectively as I can with all the facts that are available and make the decision -- not only whether or not he should be charged, but what offense he should he charged with ... and it's not as simple as most people think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the former BART officer involved in the shooting, Johannes Mehserle, has, through his attorney, refused to be interviewed by Orloff's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle resigned from the department Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BART Board of Directors apologized Thursday for the officer-involved shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and agreed to set up a board committee to review police procedures and consider the possibility of creating a BART civilian police review board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following six hours of testimony by 60 speakers, board members said they were personally apologizing for the death of Grant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; said Gail Murray, a board member from Walnut Creek, in summarizing sentiments of the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joel Keller, a board member from Antioch said he viewed videotapes of the incident and said he saw no reason why the officer should have shot Grant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family's attorney, John Burris, held a press conference at his office building near the Coliseum at 1:30 p.m. About 30 friends and relatives of Grant, including Grant's mother, Wanda Johnson, attended the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the first time I've spoken to the media, and I am doing it to beg the citizens to not use violent tactics,&quot; Johnson said, becoming emotional. &quot;I know it's a very frustrating time. But Oscar would not want to see the violence and the fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe this situation is going to come to a close and justice will be served. I'm asking you please, please, stop it and let justice prevail. Please stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 p.m. Some worried employers closing early today</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearing a repeat of Wednesday night's rioting in downtown Oakland, prompted by a fatal officer-involved shooting at the Fruitvale BART station on New Year's Day, some businesses closed for the day Thursday or let employees go home early for safety reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employees at the Clorox building at Broadway and 13th Street were told to go home at 4 p.m., in case another violent protest should erupt in the evening hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12:05 p.m. Fox Theater damaged; Oakland merchants clean up after night of vandalism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday night, one group of rioters split off toward Telegraph Avenue and attacked the recently renovated Fox Theater. Phil Tagami of CCG, said windows were broken and there was some damage to woodwork and terra cotta on the Fox building. He estimated the damage at somewhere between $10,000 and $20,000. He was diplomatic about it and said it was inconvenient more than anything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stuff like this happens all the time in San Francisco with all the protests there,&quot; he said. &quot; In Oakland, with our growing urban (center), we will have to learn to live with it. Broken glass can be replaced, the damage to the building can be repaired and it's good we still have crews working here so they can take care of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of his other buildings, including the Rotunda, were damaged, although storefront windows at the Uptown nightclub and the Fox construction office next door were smashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, merchants in the area continued cleaning up glass today and called insurance companies throughout the morning. Most felt sure the damage was not caused by those involved in the main protest, but by splinter groups who just wanted to cause trouble. But the damage was done nonetheless. And not just to property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People already don't want to move to Oakland or bring businesses here. And here we are in 2009, starting off with change with a new president, and then we have people acting like this,&quot; said the Rev. ElTyna McCree who owns Underground Treasures on 17th Street near Franklin. Her store was intact, but she was shocked at the scene at neighboring businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been here 15 years in this location. We never have this kind of situation going on. I'm hyperventilating to see all these cars mutilated and these broken windows of my fellow business owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have removed traffic cones around the Kaiser Center, where the BART board of directors is meeting. Traffic is now being allowed on 20th and Webster streets, and Lakeside Drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area is calm, but police are maintaining a presence around the building.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BART Board of Directors has been meeting for two hours, listening to speakers talk about the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III on New Year's Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside, OPD has streets blocked around the Kaiser Center on 20th Street, where BART's headquarters are located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few dozen speakers thus far have addressed the BART board at the Kaiser building in downtown Oakland. Several more are waiting to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's packed in the main board room, which has a capacity of 140 people. Side rooms have been set up to accommodate the overflow. Some have complained BART hasn't done enough to let people in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his remarks, Mandingo Hayes of Oakland pointed to a police officer in the back of the room, and said &quot;Officer, just because I look like this, don't mean I intend to do something violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What you seen last night, that was pain,&quot; Hayes said. &quot;You call them thugs, but that was pain. People is tired, don't you understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He apologized for having hoarse voice. &quot;It was from all my hollering last night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nedir Bey, adopted son of late Your Black Muslin Bakery founder Yusef Bey, told the BART board that he was pleased by the rioting Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope BART gets shut down. Eye for an eye, that what iIbelieve and if the young soldiers believe it, God bless them,&quot; Bey said. &quot;If it was my business on fire, i would bless them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the meeting started, BART board president Thomas Blalock called for moment of silence for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III. During the pledge of the allegiance, everyone stood, hands on hearts. At the end of the pledge, however, someone repeated, 'Yea justice for all'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amos Brown, on the national board for NAACP, senior minister at the Third Baptist church in San Francisco, asked the board for three items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need embrace a reverence and respect for every human life,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, &quot;BART in tandem should join with this audience in saying that was murder; don't explain it away as a mistake,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Brown asked for &quot;Fruits for repentance&quot; -- meaning major contracts for black contractors from BART.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10:30 a.m. Police estimate damages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police estimate damages to property from Wednesday night vandalism is $150,000, but the total could go higher as they assess damages. About 25 cars were badly vandalized, including some police cars and city vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the 105 arrested last night were in the area surrounded by 14th and 20 streets, and San Pablo and Broadway, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to drugs seized from some individuals, two guns were recovered from those arrested. Charges include assault on a police officer, looting, vandalism, rioting and arson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, none of those arrested have yet been charged by the District Attorney, and those arrested on misdemeanors have been cited and released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those arrested for felonies are still being held, but the number hasn't been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police are meeting with the DA today to talk about possibly taking over the investigation into the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III. The investigation is now being conducted by the BART police department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say they have beefed up staffing around the city for the rest of the day, and will respond to any incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We understand it's a very sensitive touchy situation and people need an outlet. In our society that's what's protesting is all about as long as it's peaceful,&quot; Thomason said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a group of individuals who wanted to vandalize, assault police officers and riot. We are not going to stand for that. &quot;</SPAN></P>

BART board president Thomas Blalock proposed setting up a committee comprised by four members to address major police incidents, although no action could be taken on the item today because of open meeting laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As storekeepers clean up after a night of vandalism and protests in downtown Oakland, police are bracing for more protests this morning after at least 105 people were arrested for a variety of offenses Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said charges for those arrested included assault on a police officer, looting, vandalism and arson. Some of those detained were found to have drugs, which added another count to the charges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses downtown are cleaning up this morning, dealing with the aftermath of smashed windows and cars and trash strewn on streets and sidewalks. The damage appears random on some streets, but two blocks of 17th Street between Franklin and Harrison streets were hard hit. Passers-by are shaking their heads as they survey the smashed windows of a tattoo parlor, smoothie shop, cafe, braid studio and fashion design store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leemu Tokpa had swept glass shards into two piles outside her shop, Creative African Braids, on 14th Street so that clients could get in the door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said a group of vandals smashed up her downtown Oakland shop and threw bottles at her while she was holding her 8-month-old baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was working on a client in her business, Creative African Braids on 14th Street, when a group of black males came over and started swearing and smashing her windows. She shouted at them, saying 'Why are you doing this?' Tokpa said. That's when one threw a bottle at her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had to run in the back to hide. They were cussing, saying the f-word and trying to force the door open,&quot; Tokpa said. &quot;It had nothing to do with (the BART shooting).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody feels happy about the guy getting killed, but if they come back to attack me as a black sister I feel very disappointed. I'm struggling here too. And they come and wreck my business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her brother slept in the shop all night, to protect it from further vandalism she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstration began peacefully Wednesday afternoon at the Fruitvale BART station, but the station was eventually closed from 3 to 7 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland's downtown stations at Lake Merritt and Oakland City Center were also temporarily closed because of protests. Windows were smashed at a McDonalds restaurant at 14th and Jackson streets, and Dumpsters were set afire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Oakland police are hoping protests will be less violent, but plan to have extra officers on the streets and will be in riot gear. A protest is expected outside BART headquarters, where the agency's board meeting will be held at 9 a.m.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Leland Yee, D-San Francisco, and Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, D-San Francisco, issued a joint statement today announcing they'll introduce a bill &quot;that will finally ensure an independent oversight body is established, public input is accepted, complaints and grievances are fairly considered, and responsible action is taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART was created in 1957 as a result of state legislation, with governance granted to an elected Board of Directors, the two lawmakers note. But the board has not provided a proper mechanism for public input and comment on BART Police policy, they say: &quot;Unlike the San Francisco Police Commission, BART lacks any real means for the public to air their grievances regarding police conduct or for an independent body that can propose corrective actions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Complaints and grievances against BART police officers have been investigated and adjudicated internally without any independent review,&quot; the lawmakers wrote. &quot;This is a classic case of the fox guarding the hen house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART Police Officer Johannes Mehserle's fatal shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III of Hayward in the Fruitvale BART station on New Year's Day -- witnessed by scores of passengers, and captured on cell-phone videos now airing nationwide -- &quot;is extremely tragic and disturbing,&quot; Yee and Ammiano said. &quot;Although all the evidence surrounding this case is not yet known, the video footage is beyond troubling. While the vast majority of our men and women in uniform serve with dignity and honor, there is an unfortunate reputation that has plagued the BART police force for years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The taxpayers of the Bay Area deserve their law enforcement officials, including the 206 BART officers, to be held accountable,&quot; they wrote.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan. 8--Mercury News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against a cacophony of police choppers overhead, sirens in the distance and jabbering TV reporters, Noah Mitchell sat outside Oakland's Kaiser Center on Thursday at lunchtime, filled with both anger and sorrow for the town he has always called home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love Oakland,&quot; he said, as the streets around him teemed with outrage over the New Year's Day shooting by a BART police officer of an unarmed man. &quot;But it's a troubled place. And I feel like this city won't change for a long, long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside, the BART board of directors sat like a punching bag for a community tirade against perceived police brutality. It was a reaction borne of embers reignited by the incident at the Fruitvale BART station, now churning endlessly through the YouTube portal of eyewitness news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Mitchell and others, either those protesting in the streets or supporters cheering them on from their living rooms, the true import of this moment transcends a tragic incident on a train-station platform. Mitchell is barely in his 20s, born and raised in an epicenter of America's racial struggles, part African-American, and just black enough to know what it feels like to really love-hate Oakland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I once got pulled through the window of my car by an Oakland police officer,&quot; he said in a soft, meek voice. &quot;Ever since, every time I see a police officer, I'm scared it'll happen again. But it's more than that. It's the everyday rudeness, like when I ask for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">directions, they joke it off, laugh at me, and walk on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lingering protests and scattered nighttime violence downtown this week surprised a lot of people, as if the bold response seemed out of sync with the shooting. But even though the victim was from Hayward, and the incident took place on BART property and involved BART police, the story line for many has moved on -- to Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's an accident of geography that the riots took place here and that the focus is now on Oakland,&quot; said Steven Lavoie, longtime city observer and librarian at the Oakland History Room at the main library. &quot;The problems between law enforcement and minority communities are not unique to Oakland. But because of our large minority population, these issues come to a head here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oakland,&quot; he said, &quot;is the venue for much larger social problems. And I don't think the people of the privileged class, of which I'm probably a member, understand the impact of injustice in this community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of justice came up again and again at the BART board meeting. Looking stunned by the barrage of criticism, the mostly white-male board found itself the lightning rod for a homegrown bitterness 60 years in the making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope you hear what the community is saying to you,&quot; said Ken Nelson, a local leader of the NAACP, one of several speakers calling for a state investigation into the shooting, and imploring the board to improve officer training. &quot;You can't be quiet anymore. This must be corrected immediately, or we'll continue to have flare-ups. Your silence means approval. Please do not continue to remain silent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson was asking the board to speak out, but he could have been addressing each of the 400,000 people who call &quot;Oaktown&quot; home. Oakland is and always has been a bifurcated place, with wealthier and whiter residents in the hills, poorer people of color in the flatlands, and each group able to spend entire lifetimes largely confined to one area or the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a crowd of people waited outside the front doors, locked by security officers because the conference room was already packed, local businessman Frank Tucker implored the BART board to seize the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, you've got people down there trying to break down the doors to speak to you today, and nothing's being done to let them inside,&quot; said Tucker, a board member of the city's African-American Chamber of Commerce. &quot;This is a metaphor of what's been happening on a larger scale in Oakland for years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historian Lavoie said you can trace the history of troubled relations between Oakland minorities and police to the 1950s, when the lure of post-World War II jobs brought African-Americans from the South, as well as white Southerners, many of whom would put on uniform and badge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tension that resulted had a lot to do with who was hired, because a lot of the people from the South brought attitudes with them,&quot; he said. &quot;Blacks, but also whites not willing to be as tolerant as Oakland historically had been.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lavoie says relations between police and minorities have dramatically improved since the 1960s, when the Black Panthers formed to patrol the streets, ostensibly to police the police. Despite this week's flare of street violence, &quot;what you should look at is how police responded Wednesday night, versus how they went after peace marchers in the '60s. There's a huge difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And BART spokesman Linton Johnson, an African-American who said his own aunt had been roughed up by a Los Angeles cop years ago, defended the agency's police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They care about the public and they've done a wonderful job keeping BART safe for everyone,&quot; he said. &quot;There have been only five officer-involved shootings resulting in injury or death in BART's 36 years. The officers do a hell of a job protecting the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet many still see police as intimidating. Oakland native and college student Tahirah Rasheed waved a &quot;Stop police brutality&quot; placard outside the board meeting, saying &quot;the police are modern-day slave patrollers.&quot; She's seen the homemade videos of the shooting, which apparently show officer Johannes Mehserle firing his weapon at 22-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III as he lay facedown on the platform. She says she doesn't need to see anything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those videos, which have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, are a study in chaos, as the shooting unfolds in front of dozens of train passengers returning home after New Year's Eve celebrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to reports of young men fighting on a train, BART police arrived shortly after midnight, taking Grant and several others off the train for questioning. The images show Grant pushed onto his stomach shortly before Mehserle fired his gun at Grant's back. The bullet ricocheted off the pavement and pierced his lung.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fueled by the footage, a debate has raged over whether the officer knowingly shot Grant, as the victim's family alleges, or may have tragically mistaken his handgun for a stun gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those arguments now seem lost on Rasheed and others who see the incident as part of something much bigger, no matter how much some people feel police relations with Oakland's minorities may have improved over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This shooting,&quot; said Rasheed, &quot;is the culmination of decades of&quot; bad relations between police and citizens. &quot;That BART officer should be arrested and in jail, just like anyone else who shoots somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, like her fellow Oakland native Noah Mitchell, Rasheed starts talking not about the young man killed at the Fruitvale BART station, but about seeing her older brother mistreated by a police officer when she was about 6 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was 16 years ago. But today, she says, it seems like yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan. 7--Berkeley Copwatch will meet Monday to discuss the New Year's Day killing of a 22-year-old Hayward man who reportedly was shot in the back by a BART police officer while he was restrained facedown on the floor of the Fruitvale station in Oakland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copwatch will meet at 8 p.m. at the Grassroots House, 2022 Blake St. near Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley. The public is welcome to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III was killed about 2 a.m. after the officer appeared to pull his gun from its holster on his right hip and fire directly into Grant's back, according to video aired earlier this week by TV station KTVU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been widespread speculation that the officer may have intended to reach for his Taser stun gun, which many BART police carry. BART officials have said it's not clear if Officer Johannes Mehserle was armed with a Taser during the incident. Tasers are often handed off between officers at shift changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copwatch is calling the killing a &quot;spontaneous, public execution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this incident is not met with widespread, militant response, we can surely expect more of the same,&quot; a Copwatch statement said. &quot;If you have been watching from the sidelines, this might be a good time to unleash your outrage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berkeley Copwatch, a 19-year-old all-volunteer organization, frequently holds a meeting, rally or both whenever there is an officer-involved shooting in the East Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization is based on the idea &quot;that watching the police is a crucial first step in the process of organizing,&quot; officials said. The group does not attempt to interfere in police activity or to resist police misconduct physically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group tries to reduce police violence by directly observing the police on the street, documenting incidents and keeping police accountable, according to background information on the group. The group supports victims whenever possible and seeks to educate the public on their rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan. 2--So much for a wild New Year's Eve. Although it may have been rocking for some, Bay Area streets, for the most part, remained relatively calm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">San Jose police reported no major violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was nothing out of the ordinary,&quot; officer Enrique Garcia said. &quot;People obviously went out and had a good time, but they were responsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, there were the usual suspects: drivers arrested under the influence of alcohol and drugs. There were 438 such arrests throughout California from 6 p.m. Wednesday through 6 a.m. Thursday. In the Bay Area, 84 drivers were arrested, more than double last year's total of 41.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven people died on California roads compared with four last year, according to the California Highway Patrol's preliminary figures. In the Bay Area, two traffic deaths were reported, in Solano and Sonoma counties. None was reported in the area last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's difficult to say why they are up,&quot; CHP officer Hugo Mendoza said. &quot;There's more people out there drinking and driving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase in arrests also could be attributed to CHP's maximum enforcement period, when the agency has 80 percent of its force patrolling the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, 125 law enforcement agencies were on the streets and freeways as part of Bay Area Regional Avoid anti-DUI efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite fears that downtown Santa Cruz might become a bit raucous with more than 10,000 people hitting the streets on New Year's Eve, police reported</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only 10 arrests based on minor infractions including public intoxication, narcotics possession, battery and parole violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 36 people were arrested in San Francisco, most of them on suspicion of public drunkenness, others of various misdemeanors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there were some areas where violence did mar the calmness of New Year's morning. In Oakland, one man died after being shot by a BART police officer at 2:15 a.m. Thursday. The incident occurred at the Fruitvale BART station after a confrontation on the Dublin/Pleasanton bound-train.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan. 1--So much for a wild New Year's Eve. Although it may have been rocking for some, Bay Area streets, for the most part, remained relatively calm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">San Jose police reported no major violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was nothing out of the ordinary,&quot; officer Enrique Garcia said. &quot;People obviously went out and had a good time, but they were responsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, there were the usual suspects: drivers arrested under the influence of alcohol and drugs. There were 438 such arrests throughout California from 6 p.m. Wednesday through 6 a.m. Thursday. In the Bay Area, 84 drivers were arrested, more than double last year's total of 41.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven people died on California roads compared with four last year, according to the California Highway Patrol's preliminary figures. In the Bay Area, two traffic deaths were reported, in Solano and Sonoma counties. None was reported in the area last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's difficult to say why they are up,&quot; CHP officer Hugo Mendoza said. &quot;There's more people out there drinking and driving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase in arrests also could be attributed to CHP's maximum enforcement period, when the agency has 80 percent of its force patrolling the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, 125 law enforcement agencies were on the streets and freeways as part of Bay Area Regional Avoid anti-DUI efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite fears that downtown Santa Cruz might become a bit raucous with more than 10,000 people hitting the streets on New Year's Eve, police reported</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only 10 arrests based on minor infractions including public intoxication, narcotics possession, battery and parole violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 36 people were arrested in San Francisco, most of them on suspicion of public drunkenness, others of various misdemeanors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there were some areas where violence did mar the calmness of New Year's morning. In Oakland, one man died after being shot by a BART police officer at 2:15 a.m. Thursday. The incident occurred at the Fruitvale BART station after a confrontation on the Dublin/Pleasanton bound-train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer was on the platform after reports of an altercation on the train near the West Oakland station two stops earlier. Shortly after the train arrived at the Fruitvale station from San Francisco, police separated the arguing parties, and during that process the officer's gun discharged, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c24"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART identified the dead man as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Oscar Grant,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 22. The identity of the officer was not immediately released.</SPAN></P>
